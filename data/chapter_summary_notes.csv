text_book,digital_marketing,12,chapter_name,CONTENT CREATION: VIDEO,
text_book,digital_marketing,12,summary_note,Video has become an integral part of the online world. The potential for exposure  as well as interaction  is massive and brands that fail to capitalise on this  risk being left behind as competitors build thriving communities.   ,
text_book,digital_marketing,12,summary_note,As with most content  it is up to the brand to decide how to represent its video content. Videos can be hosted on popular video-sharing websites to capitalise on already existing audiences and developed interfaces  or on bespoke websites that allow for free reign in customisation.  ,
text_book,digital_marketing,12,summary_note,Brands should then aim to optimise their videos on the chosen platforms to increase their visibility on search engines.,
text_book,digital_marketing,12,summary_note,Creating a healthy community is also important in increasing exposure. Very rarely  if ever  does an audience come to video content without input from the creators. On top of optimising for search and other tweaks  brands should upload content regularly or risk losing any ground gained.   ,
text_book,digital_marketing,12,summary_note,Social media should be considered as its platforms allow for the sharing of content  and commentary. Overall  brands should be aware that there is no quick fix for video. It requires planning and investment  as well as long-term commitment to creating brand advocates.   ,

text_book,biology,4,summary_note,"Your body has many kinds of cells, each specialized for a specific purpose. Just as we use a variety of materials to build a home, the human body is constructed from many cell types. For example, epithelial cells protect the body's surface and cover the organs and body cavities within. Bone cells help to support and protect the body. Immune system cells fight invading bacteria. Additionally, blood and blood cells carry nutrients and oxygen throughout the body while removing carbon dioxide. Each of these cell types plays a vital role during the body's growth, development, and day-to-day maintenance. In spite of their enormous variety, however, cells from all organismsâ€”even ones as diverse as bacteria, onion, and humanâ€”share certain fundamental characteristics.",
text_book,biology,5,summary_note,"The plasma membrane, the cell membrane, has many functions, but the most basic one is to define the cell's borders and keep the cell functional. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable. This means that the membrane allows some materials to freely enter or leave the cell, while other materials cannot move freely, but require a specialized structure, and occasionally, even energy investment for crossing.",
text_book,biology,6,summary_note,"Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires energy. Organisms require energy to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use considerable energy while thinking, and even during sleep. Every organism's living cells constantly use energy. Organisms import nutrients and other molecules. They metabolize (break down) and possibly synthesize into new molecules. If necessary, molecules modify, move around the cell and may distribute themselves to the entire organism. For example, the large proteins that make up muscles are actively built from smaller molecules. Complex carbohydrates break down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building, energy is required to synthesize and break down molecules. Additionally, signaling molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters transport between cells. Cells ingest and break down bacteria and viruses. Cells must also export waste and toxins to stay healthy, and many cells must swim or move surrounding materials via the beating motion of cellular appendages like cilia and flagella.",
text_book,biology,7,summary_note,"Plants and animals also must take in energy from the environment and convert it into a form that their cells can use. Mass and its stored energy enter an organismâ€™s body in one form and are converted into another form that can fuel the organismâ€™s life functions. In the process of photosynthesis, plants and other photosynthetic producers take in energy in the form of light (solar energy) and convert it into chemical energy in the form of glucose, which stores this energy in its chemical bonds. Then, a series of metabolic pathways, collectively called cellular respiration, extracts the energy from the bonds in glucose and converts it into a form that all living things can use.",
text_book,biology,8,summary_note,"The metabolic processes in all organismsâ€”from bacteria to humansâ€”require energy. To get this energy, many organisms access stored energy by eating, that is, by ingesting other organisms. But where does the stored energy in food originate? All of this energy can be traced back to photosynthesis.",
text_book,biology,9,summary_note,"t is vital for individual cells to be able to interact with their environment. This is true for both a one-celled organism growing in a puddle and a large animal living on a savanna. In order to properly respond to external stimuli, cells have developed complex mechanisms of communication that can receive a message, transfer the information across the plasma membrane, and then produce changes within the cell in response to the message. In multicellular organisms, cells send and receive chemical messages constantly to coordinate the actions of distant organs, tissues, and cells. The ability to send messages quickly and efficiently enables cells to coordinate and fine-tune their functions.",
text_book,biology,10,summary_note,"A human, like every sexually reproducing organism, begins life as a fertilized egg (embryo) or zygote. In our species, billions of cell divisions subsequently must occur in a controlled manner in order to produce a complex, multicellular human comprising trillions of cells. Thus, the original single-celled zygote is literally the ancestor of all cells in the body. However, once a human is fully grown, cell reproduction is still necessary to repair and regenerate tissues, and sometimes to increase our size! In fact, all multicellular organisms use cell division for growth and the maintenance and repair of cells and tissues. Cell division is closely regulated, and the occasional failure of this regulation can have life-threatening consequences. Single-celled organisms may also use cell division as their method of reproduction.",
text_book,european_history,3.3,chapter_name,Revolutions and Civil Wars,
text_book,european_history,3.3,summary_note,"Civil wars are presumably as old as human history; revolutions are not. There may well have been revolutions, to be sure, before the term was first usedâ€”ironically, in a rather unrevolutionary event, the â€˜Glorious Revolutionâ€™ of England in 1688. But to talk of a revolution, as opposed, say, to a mere rebellion, is to talk of a take-over of central power in a state, which in turn requires that some form of centralised state exists in the first place. This was not the case in Europe before the late Middle Ages (although states had also existed in ancient timesâ€”and thus, presumably, events that might qualify as revolutions took place). Some regions of Europe were more precocious than others, of course, especially those in the south; the â€˜Sicilian Vespersâ€™ of 1282, a bloody event which saw Sicilians drive their French masters from the island may well have been the first revolution, properly speaking. It also shows another important feature of revolutions: the participation of sections of the population and not just of a small elite in overthrowing a regimeâ€”otherwise, we might more fittingly speak of a coup dâ€™Ã©tat, a putsch or a palace revolt.",
text_book,european_history,4.1,chapter_name,Science and Technological Change,
text_book,european_history,4.1,summary_note,"In Europe, the early modern period was a time of societal transition, from the traditional towards the modern. Framed by the global expansion of European settlement, driven by the rivalry between the great powers on the continent, and by their efforts to discover and control new lands and resources at home and overseas, the era witnessed the gradual formation of Europe. It provided the conceptual and material base for European global dominance in the nineteenth century. Scientific and technological change played a central, if often overlooked part in this process, which is usually described in terms of the expansion of capitalism and the related development of institutions and innovation cultures. The invention, development, and dissemination of the printing press from the fifteenth century onwards, as well as other early modern technologies, reveal how science and technological change went hand-in-hand, and how knowledge (about mathematics, optics, astronomy, chemistry, and medicine) and the media used to convey it, were evolving in tandem. Arguably, new knowledge cultures and associated technologies were an achievement from which large parts of the enlightened eighteenth-century elites derived their self-conception, embodying progress and modernity.",
