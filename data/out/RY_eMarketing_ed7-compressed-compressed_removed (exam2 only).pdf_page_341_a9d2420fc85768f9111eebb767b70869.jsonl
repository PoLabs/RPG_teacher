ANALYSING
is relevant and targeted which encourages users to click through the ad This clickthrough 
activity creates revenue for the publisher of the content as well as more traffic for the advertiser
When a user for instance researches a product or service they will likely read a few reviews 
first Contextual ads on review sites are displayed based on the content rather than on the 
users browsing history This is achieved with an automated system that displays relevant ads 
based on the content of the web page
Although not a new concept to advertising contextual advertising and targeting does not rely 
on cookies but instead focuses on the channel or publication current affairs and contents of 
the article to reach audiences based on context
Adblockers 
The adblocker is another privacy and data protector It prevents the display andor download 
of adverts giving the website visitor control over whether or not to view the advert and 
simultaneously encouraging an advertisingfree environment Considered one of the most 
challenging phenomena that content publishers brands agencies and advertising technology 
have encountered adblockers have increased consumer awareness of the tracking technologies 
used in the digital advertising industry
The average consumer is becoming more aware of personal identifying information and far more 
wary of giving away personal data online They want more control over their online experience 
fewer ads that are intrusive and more ad relevance Adblocking has continued to rise in recent 
years which is why advertisers need to become more creative in how they target consumers
The way forward for marketing 
Although the end of thirdparty cookies may seem like the end of user tracking there are other 
technologies that may be used to track online behaviour and create targeted advertising For 
brands that previously relied on thirdparty data it is time to consider alternatives such as
	
Zeroparty data This is information that customers share voluntarily and deliberately 
with you You can secure this through quizzes website activity customer profiles and 
subscription information
	
Universal IDs This is a single identifier that recognises users across multiple platforms 
and removes the need for thirdparty data The Universal ID enables brands to track and 
target users more accurately by allowing the information related to the user to be passed 
onto approved partners in the supply chain
	
AIpowered analytics There are a host of benefits that AI can accelerate for data privacy 
initiatives One technique is to classify sensitive data in the ecosystem to ensure compliance 
to data protection laws AI can process large datasets and manage sensitive data to ensure 
the highest levels of customer privacy through automation
