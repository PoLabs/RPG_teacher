CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
23 Name two differences between prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells and how these differences benefit
multicellular organisms
24 Describe how controlling gene expression will
alter the overall protein levels in the cell
25 Describe how transcription in prokaryotic cells
can be altered by external stimulation such as excess
lactose in the environment
26 What is the difference between a repressible and
an inducible operon
27 In cancer cells alteration to epigenetic
modifications turns off genes that are normally
expressed Hypothetically how could you reverse
this process to turn these genes back on
28 A scientific study demonstrated that rat mothering
behavior impacts the stress response in their pups
Rats that were born and grew up with attentive
mothers showed low activation of stressresponse
