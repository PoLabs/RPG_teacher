have occurred remain a mystery A second hypothesis the escapist or the progressive hypothesis suggests
that viruses originated from RNA and DNA molecules that escaped from a host cell A third hypothesis the
selfreplicating hypothesis suggests that viruses may have originated from selfreplicating entities similar to
transposons or other mobile genetic elements In all cases viruses are probably continuing to evolve along with
the cells on which they rely on as hosts
As technology advances scientists may develop and refine additional hypotheses to explain the origins of
viruses The emerging field called virus molecular systematics attempts to do just that through comparisons
of sequenced genetic material These researchers hope one day to better understand the origin of virusesa
discovery that could lead to advances in the treatments for the ailments they produce
Viral Morphology
Viruses are noncellular meaning they are biological entities that do not have a cellular structure They therefore
lack most of the components of cells such as organelles ribosomes and the plasma membrane A virion
consists of a nucleic acid core an outer protein coating or capsid and sometimes an outer envelope made of
protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the host cell Viruses may also contain additional proteins
such as enzymes within the capsid or attached to the viral genome The most obvious difference between
members of different viral families is the variation in their morphology which is quite diverse An interesting
feature of viral complexity is that the complexity of the host does not necessarily correlate with the complexity
of the virion In fact some of the most complex virion structures are found in the bacteriophagesviruses that
infect the simplest living organisms bacteria
Morphology
Viruses come in many shapes and sizes but these features are consistent for each viral family As we have
seen all virions have a nucleic acid genome covered by a protective capsid The proteins of the capsid are
encoded in the viral genome and are called capsomeres Some viral capsids are simple helices or polyhedral
spheres whereas others are quite complex in structure Figure 213

In general the capsids of viruses are classified into four groups helical icosahedral enveloped and headand
tail Helical capsids are long and cylindrical Many plant viruses are helical including TMV Icosahedral viruses
