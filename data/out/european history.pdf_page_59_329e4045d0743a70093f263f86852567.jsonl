passport was required from the beginning of the early modern period in order 
to transport goods across the country In the sixteenth century France also 
introduced passports for individuals which replaced the former saufconduits 
or Schutzbriefe that were originally necessary only during wartime However 
for many decades the French example of control of travel did not inspire other 
rulers to follow 
The outer political borders and frontiers of early modern Europe were 
more difficult to define than the borders between European states During 
the Middle Ages the Mediterranean region had experienced an intrusion 
of Africa into Europe due to the Arab conquest of the Iberian Peninsula 
There the shift from the Middle Ages to the early modern period was marked 
by the new military dominance of Spain in the western Mediterranean after 
the Muslim states were crushed during reChristianisation the reconquista 
in Southern Iberia Spanish expansion to North Africa followed but after its 
failure it was the Strait of Gibraltar that became a political frontier and the 
outer limit of Europe The Muslim rulers at that point held only one coast 
that of North Africa 
In the eastern Mediterranean the AustrianOttoman frontier marked a 
confessional military political and cultural edge of Christian Europe facing 
the nonEuropean Ottoman Europe This longlasting configuration of 
frontiers with regions dominated by nonChristian rulers meant that Europe 
had a shifting eastern and southeastern border Despite being Christian 
Orthodox Russia waslike the Ottoman Empiremostly seen as a non
European power in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Only during the 
eighteenth century did this view of Russia begin to gradually change as a 
result of an integration process of Russia into Europe
It is worth noticing that the medieval idea of equating Europe with 
Christendom faded with the decline of medieval Christianisation campaigns 
and crusades during the Reformation of the sixteenth century The early 
modern period also saw massive overseas exploration and colonisationthe 
worldwide expansion of the communitas cristiana
Concerning Europes internal political borders Febvre 1973 tied them 
closely to the state He has pointed out that in the Middle Ages the very 
concept of territorial sovereignty had not yet been elaborated The kingdoms 
and duchies were not coherent territorial entities bounded in a linear and 
consistent manner Frequently one territory had several sovereigns Fiefs were 
detached from one crown and attached to another together with all that went 
with them and belonged to them This changed with the strengthening of the 
state in the early modern era
Early modern boundaries were for most of the continent perceived 
and defined less by clear geographical lines than by powers of jurisdiction
