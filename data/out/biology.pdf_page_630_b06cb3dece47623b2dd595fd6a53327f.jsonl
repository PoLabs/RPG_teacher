occurring oildegrading bacteria humans select and engineer bacteria that possess the same capability with
increased efficacy and spectrum of hydrocarbon compounds that can be processed Bioremediation is enhanced
by the addition of inorganic nutrients that help bacteria to grow
Some hydrocarbondegrading bacteria feed on hydrocarbons in the oil droplet breaking down the hydrocarbons
into smaller subunits Some species such as Alcanivorax borkumensis produce surfactants that solubilize
the oil making it soluble in water whereas other bacteria degrade the oil into carbon dioxide Under ideal
conditions it has been reported that up to 80 percent of the nonvolatile components in oil can be degraded within
one year of the spill Other oil fractions containing aromatic and highly branched hydrocarbon chains are more
difficult to remove and remain in the environment for longer periods of time
Figure 2230 Prokaryotes and bioremediation a Cleaning up oil after the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska workers hosed
oil from beaches and then used a floating boom to corral the oil which was finally skimmed from the water surface
Some species of bacteria are able to solubilize and degrade the oil b One of the most catastrophic consequences
