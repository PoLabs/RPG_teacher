CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
22 Describe the process of Southern blotting
23 A researcher wants to study cancer cells from a
patient with breast cancer Is cloning the cancer cells
an option
24 How would a scientist introduce a gene for
herbicide resistance into a plant
25 If you had a chance to get your genome
sequenced what are some questions you might be
able to have answered about yourself
26 Why is so much effort being poured into genome
mapping applications
27 How could a genetic map of the human genome
help find a cure for cancer
28 Explain why metagenomics is probably the most
revolutionary application of genomics
29 How can genomics be used to predict disease
