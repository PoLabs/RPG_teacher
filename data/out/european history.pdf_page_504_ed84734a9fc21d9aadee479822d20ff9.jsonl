Urbanisation and Urban Planning
During the twentieth century the urban population of Europe quadrupled 
attaining 450 million inhabitants Europe became a predominantly urban 
continent in which three out of four people lived in cities and towns Contrary 
to the previous century however this impressive progress was not the result 
of steady unbroken growth European urbanisation and the urban planning 
associated with it can be divided into two major periods separated by the 1970s 
The first period is characterised by intense industrialisation inherited from the 
nineteenth century and it was only temporarily halted by the two devastating 
World Wars and the economic crisis of the 1930s This is the period of the 
institutionalisation of urban planning as a discipline and as a set of successive 
theories to solve the problems of the urban societies of the industrial age
