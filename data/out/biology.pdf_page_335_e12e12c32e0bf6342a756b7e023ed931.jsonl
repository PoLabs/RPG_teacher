cells How does the animal life cycle differ from the
alternation of generations exhibited by plants
27 Explain why sexual reproduction is beneficial to a
population but can be detrimental to an individual
offspring
28 How does the role of meiosis in gamete
production differ between organisms with a diploid
dominant life cycle and organisms with an alternation
of generations life cycle
29 How do organisms with haploiddominant life
cycles ensure continued genetic diversification in
offspring without using a meiotic process to make
gametes
