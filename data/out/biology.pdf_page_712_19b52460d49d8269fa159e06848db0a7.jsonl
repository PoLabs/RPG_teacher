251  Early Plant Life
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the challenges to plant life on land

Describe the adaptations that allowed plants to colonize the land

Describe the timeline of plant evolution and the impact of land plants on other living things
The kingdom Plantae constitutes large and varied groups of organisms There are more than 300000 species of
catalogued plants Of these more than 260000 are seed plants Mosses ferns conifers and flowering plants
are all members of the plant kingdom Land plants arose within the Archaeplastida which includes the red algae
Rhodophyta and two groups of green algae Chlorophyta and Charaphyta Most biologists also consider at
least some green algae to be plants although others exclude all algae from the plant kingdom The reason
for this disagreement stems from the fact that only green algae the Chlorophytes and Charophytes share
common characteristics with land plants such as using chlorophyll a and b plus carotene in the same proportion
as plants These characteristics are absent from other types of algae
Algae and Evolutionary Paths to Photosynthesis
Some scientists consider all algae to be plants while others assert that only the green algae belong in
the kingdom Plantae Still others include only the Charophytes among the plants These divergent opinions
are related to the different evolutionary paths to photosynthesis selected for in different types of algae
While all algae are photosyntheticthat is they contain some form of a chloroplastthey didnt all become
photosynthetic via the same path
The ancestors to the Archaeplastida became photosynthetic by forming an endosymbiotic relationship with a
green photosynthetic bacterium about 165 billion years ago That algal line evolved into the red and green
algae and eventually into the modern mosses ferns gymnosperms and angiosperms Their evolutionary
trajectory was relatively straight and monophyletic In contrast algae outside of the Archaeplastida eg
the brown and golden algae of the stramenopiles and so onall became photosynthetic by secondary or
even tertiary endosymbiotic events that is they engulfed cells that already contained an endosymbiotic
cyanobacterium These latecomers to photosynthesis are parallels to the Archaeplastida in terms of
autotrophy but they did not expand to the same extent as the Archaeplastida nor did they colonize the land
Scientists who solely track evolutionary straight lines that is monophyly consider only the Charophytes
as plants The common ancestor of Charophytes and land plants excludes the other members of the
Archaeplastida Charophytes also share other features with the land plants These will be discussed in more
detail in another section

Plant Adaptations to Life on Land
As organisms adapted to life on land they had to contend with several challenges in the terrestrial environment
