REVIEW QUESTIONS
5 What property prevents the ligands of cellsurface
receptors from entering the cell
a
The molecules bind to the extracellular
domain
b
The molecules are hydrophilic and cannot
penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the
plasma membrane
c
The molecules are attached to transport
proteins that deliver them through the
bloodstream to target cells
d
The ligands are able to penetrate the
membrane and directly influence gene
expression upon receptor binding
6 The secretion of hormones by the pituitary gland is
an example of _______________
a
autocrine signaling
b
paracrine signaling
c
endocrine signaling
d
direct signaling across gap junctions
7 Why are ion channels necessary to transport ions
into or out of a cell
a
Ions are too large to diffuse through the
membrane
b
Ions are charged particles and cannot
diffuse through the hydrophobic interior of
the membrane
c
Ions do not need ion channels to move
through the membrane
d
Ions bind to carrier proteins in the
bloodstream which must be removed
before transport into the cell
8 Endocrine signals are transmitted more slowly
than paracrine signals because ___________
a
the ligands are transported through the
bloodstream and travel greater distances
b
the target and signaling cells are close
together
c
the ligands are degraded rapidly
d
the ligands dont bind to carrier proteins
during transport
9 A scientist notices that when she adds a small
watersoluble molecule to a dish of cells the cells
turn off transcription of a gene She hypothesizes that
the ligand she added binds to an ______ receptor
a
Intracellular
b
Hormone
c
Enzymelinked
d
Gated ion channellinked
10 Where do DAG and IP3 originate
a
They are formed by phosphorylation of
cAMP
b
They are ligands expressed by signaling
cells
c
They are hormones that diffuse through the
plasma membrane to stimulate protein
production
d
They are the cleavage products of the
inositol phospholipid PIP2
11 What property enables the residues of the amino
acids serine threonine and tyrosine to be
phosphorylated
a
They are polar
b
They are nonpolar
c
They contain a hydroxyl group
d
They occur more frequently in the amino
acid sequence of signaling proteins
12 Histamine binds to the H1 Gproteinlinked
receptor to initiate the itchiness and airway
constriction associated with an allergic response If a
mutation in the associated Gproteins alpha subunit
prevented the hydrolysis of GTP how would the
allergic response change
a
More severe allergic response compared to
normal Gprotein signaling
b
Less severe allergic response compared to
normal Gprotein signaling
c
No allergic response
d
No change compared to normal Gprotein
signaling
13 A scientist observes a mutation in the
transmembrane region of EGFR that eliminates its
ability to be stabilized by binding interactions during
dimerization after ligand binding Which hypothesis
regarding the effect of this mutation on EGF signaling
is most likely to be correct
a
EGF signaling cascades would be active for
longer in the cell
b
EGF signaling cascades would be active for
a shorter period of time in the cell
c
EGF signaling cascades would not occur
d
EGF signaling would be unaffected
14 What is the function of a phosphatase
a
A phosphatase removes phosphorylated
amino acids from proteins
b
A phosphatase removes the phosphate
group from phosphorylated amino acid
residues in a protein
c
A phosphatase phosphorylates serine
threonine and tyrosine residues
d
A phosphatase degrades second
messengers in the cell
