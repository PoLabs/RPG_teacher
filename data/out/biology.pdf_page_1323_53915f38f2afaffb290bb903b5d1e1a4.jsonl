Figure 4212 A T cell receptor spans the membrane and projects variable binding regions into the extracellular space
to bind processed antigens via MHC molecules on APCs
Helper T Lymphocytes
The TH lymphocytes function indirectly to identify potential pathogens for other cells of the immune system
These cells are important for extracellular infections such as those caused by certain bacteria helminths
and protozoa TH lymphocytes recognize specific antigens displayed in the MHC II complexes of APCs There
are two major populations of TH cells TH1 and TH2 TH1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of
macrophages and other T cells TH1 cells activate the action of cyotoxic T cells as well as macrophages TH2
cells stimulate nave B cells to destroy foreign invaders via antibody secretion Whether a TH1 or a TH2 immune
response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells of the innate immune system
which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen
The TH1mediated response involves macrophages and is associated with inflammation Recall the frontline
defenses of macrophages involved in the innate immune response Some intracellular bacteria such as
Mycobacterium tuberculosis have evolved to multiply in macrophages after they have been engulfed These
pathogens evade attempts by macrophages to destroy and digest the pathogen When M tuberculosis infection
occurs macrophages can stimulate nave T cells to become TH1 cells These stimulated T cells secrete specific
cytokines that send feedback to the macrophage to stimulate its digestive capabilities and allow it to destroy the
colonizing M tuberculosis In the same manner TH1activated macrophages also become better suited to ingest
and kill tumor cells In summary TH1 responses are directed toward intracellular invaders while TH2 responses
are aimed at those that are extracellular
B Lymphocytes
When stimulated by the TH2 pathway nave B cells differentiate into antibodysecreting plasma cells A plasma
cell is an immune cell that secrets antibodies these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens
Similar to T cells nave B cells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors BCRs which are membrane
bound forms of Ig immunoglobulin or an antibody The B cell receptor has two heavy chains and two light
chains connected by disulfide linkages Each chain has a constant and a variable region the latter is involved in
antigen binding Two other membrane proteins Ig alpha and Ig beta are involved in signaling The receptors of
any particular B cell as shown in Figure 4213 are all the same but the hundreds of millions of different B cells
in an individual have distinct recognition domains that contribute to extensive diversity in the types of molecular
structures to which they can bind In this state B cells function as APCs They bind and engulf foreign antigens
via their BCRs and then display processed antigens in the context of MHC II molecules to TH2 cells When a
TH2 cell detects that a B cell is bound to a relevant antigen it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to
proliferate rapidly which makes thousands of identical clonal copies of it and then it synthesizes and secretes
antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the BCRs The activation of B cells corresponding
to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection This
phenomenon drastically but briefly changes the proportions of BCR variants expressed by the immune system
and shifts the balance toward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen
