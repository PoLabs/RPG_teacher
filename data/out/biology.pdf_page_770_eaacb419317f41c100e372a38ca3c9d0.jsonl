period and were the dominant plant life during the Mesozoic Modernday gymnosperms belong to four phyla
The largest phylum Coniferophyta is represented by conifers the predominant plants at high altitude and
latitude Cycads phylum Cycadophyta resemble palm trees and grow in tropical climates Ginkgophyta is
represented today by a single species Ginkgo biloba The last phylum Gnetophyta is a diverse group of
plants that produce vessel elements in their wood
263 Angiosperms
Angiosperms are the dominant form of plant life in most terrestrial ecosystems comprising about 90 percent of
all plant species Most crops and ornamental plants are angiosperms Their success comes from two
innovative structures that protect reproduction from variability in the environment the flower and the fruit
Flowers were derived from modified leaves their color and fragrance encourages speciesspecific pollination
The main parts of a flower are the sepals and petals which protect the reproductive parts the stamens and the
carpels The stamens produce the male gametes in pollen grains The carpels contain the female gametes the
eggs inside the ovules which are within the ovary of a carpel The walls of the ovary thicken after fertilization
ripening into fruit that ensures dispersal by wind water or animals
The angiosperm life cycle is dominated by the sporophyte stage Double fertilization is an event unique to
angiosperms One sperm in the pollen fertilizes the egg forming a diploid zygote while the other combines with
the two polar nuclei forming a triploid cell that develops into a food storage tissue called the endosperm
Flowering plants are divided into two main groups the monocots and eudicots according to the number of
cotyledons in the seedlings Basal angiosperms belong to an older lineage than monocots and eudicots
264 The Role of Seed Plants
Angiosperm diversity is due in part to multiple interactions with animals Herbivory has favored the
development of defense mechanisms in plants and avoidance of those defense mechanisms in animals
Conversely seed dispersal can be aided by animals that eat plant fruits Pollination the transfer of pollen to a
carpel is mainly carried out by wind and animals and angiosperm fruits and seeds have evolved numerous
adaptations to capture the wind or attract specific classes of animals
Plants play a key role in ecosystems They are a source of food and medicinal compounds and provide raw
materials for many industries Rapid deforestation and industrialization however threaten plant biodiversity In
turn this threatens the ecosystem
