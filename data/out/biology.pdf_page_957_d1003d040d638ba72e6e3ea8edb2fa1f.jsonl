304 Leaves
Leaves are the main site of photosynthesis A typical leaf consists of a lamina the broad part of the leaf also
called the blade and a petiole the stalk that attaches the leaf to a stem The arrangement of leaves on a
stem known as phyllotaxy enables maximum exposure to sunlight Each plant species has a characteristic leaf
arrangement and form The pattern of leaf arrangement may be alternate opposite or spiral while leaf form
may be simple or compound Leaf tissue consists of the epidermis which forms the outermost cell layer and
mesophyll and vascular tissue which make up the inner portion of the leaf In some plant species leaf form is
modified to form structures such as tendrils spines bud scales and needles
305 Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants
Water potential  is a measure of the difference in potential energy between a water sample and pure water
The water potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration pressure gravity and matric
potential Water potential and transpiration influence how water is transported through the xylem in plants
These processes are regulated by stomatal opening and closing Photosynthates mainly sucrose move from
sources to sinks through the plants phloem Sucrose is actively loaded into the sievetube elements of the
phloem The increased solute concentration causes water to move by osmosis from the xylem into the phloem
The positive pressure that is produced pushes water and solutes down the pressure gradient The sucrose is
unloaded into the sink and the water returns to the xylem vessels
306 Plant Sensory Systems and Responses
Plants respond to light by changes in morphology and activity Irradiation by red light converts the
photoreceptor phytochrome to its farred lightabsorbing formPfr This form controls germination and
flowering in response to length of day as well as triggers photosynthesis in dormant plants or those that just
emerged from the soil Bluelight receptors cryptochromes and phototropins are responsible for phototropism
Amyloplasts which contain heavy starch granules sense gravity Shoots exhibit negative gravitropism
whereas roots exhibit positive gravitropism Plant hormonesnaturally occurring compounds synthesized in
small amountscan act both in the cells that produce them and in distant tissues and organs Auxins are
responsible for apical dominance root growth directional growth toward light and many other growth
responses Cytokinins stimulate cell division and counter apical dominance in shoots Gibberellins inhibit
dormancy of seeds and promote stem growth Abscisic acid induces dormancy in seeds and buds and protects
plants from excessive water loss by promoting stomatal closure Ethylene gas speeds up fruit ripening and
dropping of leaves Plants respond to touch by rapid movements thigmotropy and thigmonasty and slow
differential growth thigmomorphogenesis Plants have evolved defense mechanisms against predators and
pathogens Physical barriers like bark and spines protect tender tissues Plants also have chemical defenses
including toxic secondary metabolites and hormones which elicit additional defense mechanisms
