Male Gametophyte
A male cone has a central axis on which bracts a type of modified leaf are attached The bracts are known as
microsporophylls Figure 3210 and are the sites where microspores will develop The microspores develop
inside the microsporangium Within the microsporangium cells known as microsporocytes divide by meiosis
to produce four haploid microspores Further mitosis of the microspore produces two nuclei the generative
nucleus and the tube nucleus Upon maturity the male gametophyte pollen is released from the male cones
and is carried by the wind to land on the female cone

Female Gametophyte
The female cone also has a central axis on which bracts known as megasporophylls Figure 3210 are
present In the female cone megaspore mother cells are present in the megasporangium The megaspore
mother cell divides by meiosis to produce four haploid megaspores One of the megaspores divides to form
the multicellular female gametophyte while the others divide to form the rest of the structure The female
gametophyte is contained within a structure called the archegonium
