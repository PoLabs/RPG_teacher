Between Violence and Pragmatism
While empires often expanded through brutal conquest in some cases 
with systematic killings forced resettlement and the enslavement of native 
populations their subsequent operation was often less dramatic Once their 
authority was established the aggressive rhetoric was usually complemented 
by pragmatic accommodation Faced with the reality of cultural racial 
and religious diversity imperial authorities often set out to institutionalise 
difference Whereas modern nationstates usually sought to homogenise their 
polities and people early modern empires thrived on difference In so doing 
and while integrating their diverse populations as subjects they also reinforced 
hierarchies andin some casessegregation While both contemporaries 
and todays academics often frame colonial populations as victims freedom 
fighters or collaborators many locals were none of these things somewhere 
in between or they played different roles at different times In an economic 
sense however they were heavily exploited Large parts of the colonial world 
were turned into a sweatshop for the budding capitalism of Europe This was 
perhaps less visible in contiguous empires While they also extracted resources 
the distinction between metropole and colony was often less clear and inferior 
social groups such as the peasants were equally exploited 
In many parts of Asia European powers improvised a bricolage of 
metropolitan institutions imposed upon local systems of governance Asian 
kings governors and village heads provided the administrative backbone 
to enable the Europeans to rule and extract commodities and taxes In South 
America Portuguese and Spanish institutions of government and justice were 
grafted onto local societies However while the Spanish exploited indigenous 
labour they depended on the survival of native communities and elites to 
make the empire work In the settler societies of less populated or forcibly 
emptied areas such as South Africa and North America institutions imported 
from Europe would dominate because local ones were destroyed or ignored 
Landed empires like Russia would employ both approaches at different times 
the initial destruction of local institutions in the east and south where they 
were considered inferior before religious tolerance was granted later and 
their cooptation in the Westfor example in the Baltic provinceswhere 
local society was viewed as more developed than in Russia proper 
PeoplesPeopling 
The early modern imperial expansion triggered the movement of people from 
Europe Empire provided a job an escape from home and the pursuit of 
honour and wealth Some went with the aim to return preferably rich others
