Figure 3614 A sound wave causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate This vibration is amplified as it moves
across the malleus incus and stapes The amplified vibration is picked up by the oval window causing pressure
waves in the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani The complexity of the pressure waves is determined
by the changes in amplitude and frequency of the sound waves entering the ear
Cochlear implants can restore hearing in people who have a nonfunctional cochlea The implant consists of
a microphone that picks up sound A speech processor selects sounds in the range of human speech and
a transmitter converts these sounds to electrical impulses which are then sent to the auditory nerve Which
of the following types of hearing loss would not be restored by a cochlear implant
a
Hearing loss resulting from absence or loss of hair cells in the organ of Corti
b
Hearing loss resulting from an abnormal auditory nerve
c
Hearing loss resulting from fracture of the cochlea
d
Hearing loss resulting from damage to bones of the middle ear
The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti spiral organ It is composed of hair cells held in place above the
basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil with their exposed short hairlike stereocilia contacting
or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them The inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors
and exist in a single row numbering approximately 3500 The stereocilia from inner hair cells extend into
small dimples on the tectorial membranes lower surface The outer hair cells are arranged in three or four
rows They number approximately 12000 and they function to fine tune incoming sound waves The longer
stereocilia that project from the outer hair cells actually attach to the tectorial membrane All of the stereocilia are
mechanoreceptors and when bent by vibrations they respond by opening a gated ion channel refer to Figure
3615 As a result the hair cell membrane is depolarized and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear nerve
Intensity volume of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated
