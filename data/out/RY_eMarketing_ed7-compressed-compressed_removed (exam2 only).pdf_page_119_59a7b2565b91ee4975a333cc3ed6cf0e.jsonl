CREATING
Facebook and YouTube are popular choices because of their large user base and thus potential 
reach However more niche platforms such as Pinterest or LinkedIn may be better choices as 
your content will appeal to and resonate more with these refined target audiences possibly 
resulting in more engagement than on one of the larger platforms 
What are your goals 
Certain platforms lend themselves to certain business and marketing goals Do you just want 
awareness Or do you want to build relationships and establish yourself as an industry expert 
Are you looking for hard sales and traffic Each platform will meet different objectives and it 
is important to choose one that is most appropriate to what you want to achieve 
As discussed earlier in the chapter marketing on social media is no longer without costs 
As more and more players enter the market getting your content seen and noticed requires 
promoted posts paidfor ads and targeted marketing Even if having a channel page or 
profile on a platform is free creating content especially videos to put on the platform costs 
money It is important that the channel you use to post your content gives you the return on 
investment that you want 
1315 RULES OF ENGAGEMENT 
Social media implies a democratisation of information and it requires authenticity and openness 
from those who deliberately use it for marketing This means that good and bad stories spread 
easily and stay accessible Jeff Jarvis had problems with Dell way back in 2005 and you can 
easily find all the relevant information about his ordeal with a quick Google search for Dell hell 
Although you engage publicly with a wide audience when marketing online marketers need 
to remember that they are communicating with individuals While marketers should engage 
in the conversation and ideally lead it they cannot control it nor should they take over the 
conversation or risk getting cancelled
Ideally marketers should follow a workflow protocol to manage the social community This 
process is further discussed in Chapter 14 Social media strategy 
13151 Marketing to content creators

influencers who tend to hold a lot of sway They are a great option for social media strategy 
to reach new audiences but only if such collaboration fit into your brand strategy If there is 
potential alignment supply specific content creators with the tools and resources they need 
to talk easily about your product including links to your social profiles Twitter handles and 
hashtags
