Alternative RNA Splicing
In the 1970s genes were first observed that exhibited alternative RNA splicing Alternative RNA splicing is a
mechanism that allows different protein products to be produced from one gene when different combinations
of exons are combined to form the mRNA Figure 1611 This alternative splicing can be haphazard but
more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation with the frequency of different
splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of different protein products in
different cells or at different stages of development Alternative splicing is now understood to be a common
mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes according to one estimate 70 percent of genes in humans are
expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing Although there are multiple ways to alternatively
splice RNA transcripts the original 53 order of the exons is always conserved That is a transcript with
exons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 might be spliced 1 2 4 5 6 7 or 1 2 3 6 7 but never 1 2 5 4 3 6 7
Figure 1611 There are five basic modes of alternative splicing
