243 Ecology of Fungi
Fungi have colonized nearly all environments on Earth but are frequently found in cool dark moist places with
a supply of decaying material Fungi are saprobes that decompose organic matter Many successful mutualistic
relationships involve a fungus and another organism Many fungi establish complex mycorrhizal associations
with the roots of plants Some ants farm fungi as a supply of food Lichens are a symbiotic relationship between
a fungus and a photosynthetic organism usually an alga or cyanobacterium The photosynthetic organism
provides energy from stored carbohydrates while the fungus supplies minerals and protection Some animals
that consume fungi help disseminate spores over long distances
244 Fungal Parasites and Pathogens
Fungi establish parasitic relationships with plants and animals Fungal diseases can decimate crops and spoil
food during storage Compounds produced by fungi can be toxic to humans and other animals Mycoses are
infections caused by fungi Superficial mycoses affect the skin whereas systemic mycoses spread through the
body Fungal infections are difficult to cure since fungi like their hosts are eukaryotic and cladistically related
closely to Kingdom Animalia
245 Importance of Fungi in Human Life
Fungi are important to everyday human life Fungi are important decomposers in most ecosystems Mycorrhizal
fungi are essential for the growth of most plants Fungi as food play a role in human nutrition in the form of
mushrooms and also as agents of fermentation in the production of bread cheeses alcoholic beverages and
numerous other food preparations Secondary metabolites of fungi are used as medicines such as antibiotics
and anticoagulants Fungi are model organisms for the study of eukaryotic genetics and metabolism
