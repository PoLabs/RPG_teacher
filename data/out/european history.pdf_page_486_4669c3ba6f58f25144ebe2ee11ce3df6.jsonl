Philanthropy
The example of Halle and its missionary connections illustrates how welfare 
continued to be linked to religious motives even as welfare measures were 
further secularised during the eighteenth century Social issues became a major 
concern to Enlightenment thinkers and social reformers Philanthropy literally 
meaning love of mankindthe private promotion of welfaredeveloped 
into a bourgeois phenomenon based on enlightened humanitarianism It 
spawned organisations that campaigned for a wide variety of improvements 
ranging from adult education prison reform aid for especially vulnerable social 
groups like immigrants prostitutes and mariners to the abolition of slavery 
Some devoted themselves to more specific concerns like saving people from 
drowning Through a combination of public private and religious interests 
a mixed economy of welfare emerged Like religious charity philanthropy 
was designed to benefit donors as well as recipients It can be argued to have 
been instrumental to both welfare and social control Unlike earlier welfare 
measures taken by authorities and churches this new brand of benevolence 
extended moral responsibility beyond local communities Philanthropists 
cooperated transnationally and regarded themselves as cosmopolitans
Social Engineering or Social Control
There is much discussion as to whether the early modern period saw attempts 
at social engineering be it of a religious or of a secular kind or a combination 
of both For those who think that some form of social engineering did take 
place the key concept is social discipline a translation of the German term 
Sozialdisziplinierung It suggests that there were indeed conscious and long
term attempts by church andor lay authorities starting somewhere in the 
sixteenth century under the influence of the Protestant Reformation and 
the Catholic CounterReformation to mould peoples behaviour uproot 
traditional mentalities and belief systems and transform entire populations 
into pious and obedient subjects Even among those who believe that such 
attempts existed however there is considerable dissent concerning the level 
of success that they might have had
A lot of criticism has been levelled against the notion of social discipline 
Many studies have shown that there are few indicators of overall behaviour 
changes through conscious efforts from above More than that it has also 
been argued that few conscious efforts for such societal moulding by the 
authorities existed in the first place It is true that churches triedegged on by 
confessional competitionto inculcate moral values and behavioural norms 
but such efforts were often of a shortterm nature Secular authorities in turn
