Figure 92 In chemical signaling a cell may target itself autocrine signaling a cell connected by gap junctions
a nearby cell paracrine signaling or a distant cell endocrine signaling Paracrine signaling acts on nearby cells
endocrine signaling uses the circulatory system to transport ligands and autocrine signaling acts on the signaling cell
Signaling via gap junctions involves signaling molecules moving directly between adjacent cells
Paracrine Signaling
Signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals Paracrine signals
move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix These types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last
only a short period of time In order to keep the response localized paracrine ligand molecules are normally
quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by neighboring cells Removing the signals will reestablish the
concentration gradient for the signal allowing them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released
again
One example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells A nerve
cell consists of a cell body several short branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli and a long
extension called an axon which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells The junction between
nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse A synaptic signal is a chemical signal that
travels between nerve cells Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fastmoving electrical impulses
When these impulses reach the end of the axon the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the
release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters from the presynaptic cell the cell emitting the signal
The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances 2040 nanometers between nerve cells
which are called chemical synapses Figure 93 The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to
travel quickly this enables an immediate response such as Take your hand off the stove
When the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell the electrochemical
potential of the target cell changes and the next electrical impulse is launched The neurotransmitters that are
released into the chemical synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the
recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal
