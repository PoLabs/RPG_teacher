Lets Move Campaign
Obesity is a growing epidemic and the rate of obesity among children is rapidly rising in the United States
To combat childhood obesity and ensure that children get a healthy start in life first lady Michelle Obama
has launched the Lets Move campaign The goal of this campaign is to educate parents and caregivers
on providing healthy nutrition and encouraging active lifestyles to future generations This program aims to
involve the entire community including parents teachers and healthcare providers to ensure that children
have access to healthy foodsmore fruits vegetables and whole grainsand consume fewer calories from
processed foods Another goal is to ensure that children get physical activity With the increase in television
viewing and stationary pursuits such as video games sedentary lifestyles have become the norm Learn

Organic Precursors
The organic molecules required for building cellular material and tissues must come from food Carbohydrates or
sugars are the primary source of organic carbons in the animal body During digestion digestible carbohydrates
are ultimately broken down into glucose and used to provide energy through metabolic pathways Complex
carbohydrates including polysaccharides can be broken down into glucose through biochemical modification
however humans do not produce the enzyme cellulase and lack the ability to derive glucose from the
polysaccharide cellulose In humans these molecules provide the fiber required for moving waste through the
large intestine and a healthy colon The intestinal flora in the human gut are able to extract some nutrition from
these plant fibers The excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles
for later use Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions such as longdistance running and to provide
energy during food shortage Excess glycogen can be converted to fats which are stored in the lower layer of
the skin of mammals for insulation and energy storage Excess digestible carbohydrates are stored by mammals
in order to survive famine and aid in mobility
Another important requirement is that of nitrogen Protein catabolism provides a source of organic nitrogen
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and protein breakdown provides amino acids that are used for
cellular function The carbon and nitrogen derived from these become the building block for nucleotides nucleic
acids proteins cells and tissues Excess nitrogen must be excreted as it is toxic Fats add flavor to food and
promote a sense of satiety or fullness Fatty foods are also significant sources of energy because one gram
of fat contains nine calories Fats are required in the diet to aid the absorption of fatsoluble vitamins and the
production of fatsoluble hormones
Essential Nutrients
While the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors
there are some nutrients that need to be consumed from food These nutrients are termed essential nutrients
meaning they must be eaten and the body cannot produce them
The omega3 alphalinolenic acid and the omega6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some
membrane phospholipids Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small
quantities for many enzymes to function and for this reason are considered to be coenzymes Absence or low
levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on health as outlined in Table 341 and Table 342 Both fatsoluble
and watersoluble vitamins must be obtained from food Minerals listed in Table 343 are inorganic essential
nutrients that must be obtained from food Among their many functions minerals help in structure and regulation
and are considered cofactors Certain amino acids also must be procured from food and cannot be synthesized
by the body These amino acids are the essential amino acids The human body can synthesize only 11 of the
20 required amino acids the rest must be obtained from food The essential amino acids are listed in Table 344
