Figure 1410 A eukaryote contains a welldefined nucleus whereas in prokaryotes the chromosome lies in the
cytoplasm in an area called the nucleoid
In eukaryotic cells DNA and RNA synthesis occur in a separate compartment from protein synthesis
In prokaryotic cells both processes occur together What advantages might there be to separating the
processes What advantages might there be to having them occur together
The size of the genome in one of the most wellstudied prokaryotes Ecoli is 46 million base pairs
approximately 11 mm if cut and stretched out So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell The DNA
is twisted by what is known as supercoiling Supercoiling suggests that DNA is either underwound less than
one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs or overwound more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs from its normal
relaxed state Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling other proteins and enzymes such as
DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure
Eukaryotes whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule employ a different type of packing
strategy to fit their DNA inside the nucleus Figure 1411 At the most basic level DNA is wrapped around
proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes The histones are evolutionarily conserved
proteins that are rich in basic amino acids and form an octamer composed of two molecules of each of four
different histones The DNA remember it is negatively charged because of the phosphate groups is wrapped
tightly around the histone core This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker DNA This is
also known as the beads on a string structure With the help of a fifth histone a string of nucleosomes is further
compacted into a 30nm fiber which is the diameter of the structure Metaphase chromosomes are even further
condensed by association with scaffolding proteins At the metaphase stage the chromosomes are at their most
compact approximately 700 nm in width
In interphase eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining The
tightly packaged region is known as heterochromatin and the less dense region is known as euchromatin
Heterochromatin usually contains genes that are not expressed and is found in the regions of the centromere
and telomeres The euchromatin usually contains genes that are transcribed with DNA packaged around
nucleosomes but not further compacted
