the Covid19 pandemic has revolutionised office work Online activities have 
transformed private households into both family and office premises with

Involuntary Nonwork and the Welfare State
Depending on wage work means that periods of nonwork in which one does 
not earn money can lead to existential crisis Hence the welfare state is here 
understood with regard to the risks of nonwork Aspects of the welfare state

unemployed are difficult to organise In addition not being a supplicant but 
an active person with legal entitlement gave individuals selfconsciousness in
