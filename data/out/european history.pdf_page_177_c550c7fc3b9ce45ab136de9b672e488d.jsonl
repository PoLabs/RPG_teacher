21 DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE
157
demographic policies inspired by racist conceptions spreading from Germany 
especially put an increasing migratory pressure on the Jewish population 
of the region Drawing from the same ideological mainstream of that time 
many political elites of the European interwar period started to adopt more 
ambitious demographic policies This resulted in the formulation of both 
various population growth theories and intrusive pronatalist policies with 
an increasingly militaristic characterprimarily but not exclusively in the 
countries that lost the First World War Yet still there was a constant decline 
in natality 
The Great Depression of the 1930s only intensified an atmosphere of 
concern over the demographic development of Europe in 1913 for example 
the number of newborns per 1000 inhabitants was 190 in France 282 in 
Netherlands 272 in Finland and 276 in Germany by 1935 this had declined 
to 153 in France 202 in the Netherlands and 196 in Finland That same year 
in Germany aggressive pronatalist policies increased the birth rate slightly 
to 189 encouraged by the Nazis who were in their second year of power 
In 1939 the first year of the Second World War the birth rate rose to 204 a 
number that would never be reached again in Germany
