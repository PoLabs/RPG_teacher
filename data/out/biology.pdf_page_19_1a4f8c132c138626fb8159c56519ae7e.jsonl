Introduction
Viewed from space Earth offers no clues about the diversity of life forms that reside there Scientists believe that
the first forms of life on Earth were microorganisms that existed for billions of years in the ocean before plants
and animals appeared The mammals birds and flowers so familiar to us are all relatively recent originating 130
to 250 million years ago The earliest representatives of the genus Homo to which we belong have inhabited
this planet for only the last 25 million years and only in the last 300000 years have humans started looking like
we do today
