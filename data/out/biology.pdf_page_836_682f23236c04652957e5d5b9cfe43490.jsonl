or damp terrestrial environments throughout the world They are commonly called water bears because of
their plump bodies and the large claws on their stubby legs There are over 1000 species most of which are
less than 1 mm in length A chitinous cuticle covers the body surface and may be divided into plates Figure

are resistance to multiple environmental challenges including desiccation very low temperatures vacuum high
pressure and radiation They can suspend their metabolic activity for years and survive the loss of up to 99
of their water content Their remarkable resistance has recently been attributed to unique proteins that replace
water in their cells and protect their internal cell structure and their DNA from damage
