efforts to merge the concert idea with nationalitybased politics finally came to 
an end with the arrival of a new age of global competition between industrial 
nationstates Only after the First World War 19141918 would US President 
Woodrow Wilson 18561924 again try to wed these unwieldy partners It 
was not without significance that this outsider upon his arrival in Europe in 
January 1919 began his peacebroking mission by paying tribute at the statue 
of Mazzini in his birthplace Genoa
Pacifist Liberal and Socialist Ideas of Europe
Above all nineteenthcentury Europe was marked by accelerated 
industrialisation technological innovation and new ways of consuming and 
circulating goods across regions and borders The breakthrough of capitalist 
modes of production and the era of mass consumption led to the formation of 
new societal organisations and the forging of new networks for transnational 
cooperation Though different in their core objectives many of these actors 
and networks agreed on implicit or explicit visions of humanitarianism and 
strove for a united Europe as the basis for lasting peace on the continent
Focusing on unity and cooperation the main goal was to achieve a perpetual 
peace Perpetual peace projects were known since the Middle Ages and widely 
spread during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries While heterogeneous

provide political stability for the continent At the Congress of Vienna in 1815 
the European powers tried to set up a new stable order in Europe However 
the congress brought neither lasting peace nor stable political regimes and 
consequently alternative ideas were discussed
During the nineteenth century this idea took the shape of a political union 
of European states The first and perhaps best known of these projects was 
formulated in the manifesto On the Reorganisation of European Society written in 
1814 by the French philosopher Henri de SaintSimon 17601825 who tried 
without success to present it at the Congress of Vienna In his manifesto Saint
Simon for the first time formulated the idea of a great European parliament 
and described the unification of Europe as an incremental process first 
France and England would form a union then Germany would join once it 
had achieved its own unification The conditions for membership were to be 
decided under a constitutional parliamentary and liberal system
In 1849 representatives from peaceful societies all over the world met 
in Paris for the third International Peace Congress That year Victor Hugo 
acted as president of the congress and shared his vision of a brotherly 
united European federation Hugos term of a United States of Europe was 
later used by the French philosopher Charles Lemonnier 18061891 who
