structure some are aquatic with motile spores with flagella an example is the Allomyces Zygomycota conjugated
fungi have a multicellular body structure features include zygospores and presence in soil examples are bread and
fruit molds Ascomycota sac fungi may have unicellular or multicellular body structure a feature is sexual spores
in sacs asci examples include the yeasts used in bread wine and beer production Basidiomycota club fungi
have multicellular bodies features includes sexual spores in the basidiocarp mushroom and that they are mostly
decomposers mushroomproducing fungi are an example 29 The bark beetles and the fungus have a mutualistic
relationship since each partner benefits from interacting with the other The beetle can provide food for its offspring
while the fungus can spread to new trees
31 Dermatophytes that colonize skin break down the keratinized layer of
dead cells that protects tissues from bacterial invasion Once the integrity of the skin is breached bacteria can enter the
deeper layers of tissues and cause infections 33 The dough is often contaminated by toxic spores that float in the air
It was one of Louis Pasteurs achievements to purify reliable strains of bakers yeast to produce bread consistently

not filtered by water or other algae on land therefore there is no need to collect light at additional wavelengths
made available by other pigment coloration 26 Possible challenges include
Climate Deserts are more arid than
swamps so there is less humidity in the air and less water in the soilReproduction Cactuses are often not densely
populated whereas cattails occur in groupsTemperature During the day deserts are usually hot which increases
the risk of desiccation The desert climate will also have broader temperature ranges extremes 28 It allows for
survival through periodic droughts and colonization of environments where the supply of water fluctuates 30 The
bryophytes are divided into three phyla the liverworts or Hepaticophyta the hornworts or Anthocerotophyta and the
mosses or true Bryophyta 32 Similarities include
Sexual reproduction is dependent upon water in which the
male gamete swimsThe haploid organism is the dominant part of the life cycle Differences include
Bryophyte
gametotangia protect the gametes and the growing embryoBryophytes make sporangium to produce spores 34
Ferns are considered the most advanced seedless vascular plants because they display characteristics commonly
observed in seed plantsthey form large leaves and branching roots

contributed to diversity with plants needing to attract some insects and repel others 21 The trees are adapted to
arid weather and do not lose as much water due to transpiration as nonconifers 23 The resemblance between
cycads and palm trees is only superficial Cycads are gymnosperms and do not bear flowers or fruit Cycads produce
cones large female cones that produce naked seeds and smaller male cones on separate plants Palms do not 25
Using animal pollinators promotes crosspollination and increases genetic diversity The odds that the pollen will reach
another flower are greatly increased compared with the randomness of wind pollination

C 18 D 19 The development of specialized tissues affords more complex animal anatomy and physiology because
differentiated tissue types can perform unique functions and work together in tandem to allow the animal to perform
more functions For example specialized muscle tissue allows directed and efficient movement and specialized
nervous tissue allows for multiple sensory modalities as well as the ability to respond to various sensory information
these functions are not necessarily available to other nonanimal organisms 21 Altered expression of homeotic genes
can lead to major changes in the morphology of the individual Hox genes can affect the spatial arrangements of organs
and body parts If a Hox gene was mutated or duplicated it could affect where a leg might be on a fruit fly or how far
apart a persons fingers are 23 The evolution of bilateral symmetry led to designated head and tail body regions and
promoted more efficient mobility for animals This improved mobility allowed for more skillful seeking of resources and
prey escaping from predators The appearance of the coelom in coelomates provides many internal organs with shock
absorption making them less prone to physical damage from bodily assault A coelom also gives the body greater
flexibility which promotes more efficient movement The relatively loose placement of organs within the coelom allows
them to develop and grow with some spatial freedom which promoted the evolution of optimal organ arrangement
The coelom also provides space for a circulatory system which is an advantageous way to distribute body fluids and
gases 25 In many cases morphological similarities between animals may be only superficial similarities and may
not indicate a true evolutionary relationship One of the reasons for this is that certain morphological traits can evolve
along very different evolutionary branches of animals for similar ecological reasons 27 It is true that multiple mass
extinction events have taken place since the Cambrian period when most currently existing animal phyla appeared
and the majority of animal species were commonly wiped out during these events However a small number of animal
species representing each phylum were usually able to survive each extinction event allowing the phylum to continue
to evolve rather than become altogether extinct
