733 Collecting and collating design assets 
Elements such as your logo and brand colours represent your brand and form part of your 
brand expression The latest versions of these brand assets need to be available to the designer 
or marketing agency designing your website 
Getting the right brand assets to designers in a good quality format that they can easily access 
will save time and avoid expensive mistakes 
Here is a list of brand assets that a designer requires to start working on a site The quality 
format or file type and file size are all important considerations
	
Brand guidelines or style guide These are 
presented in Adobe Reader PDF format 
	
Logo and other key brand elements 
These are generated in Illustrator formatai 
or Photoshop format psd Best practice 
is to have your logo designed using vector graphics If your logo or other brand assets 
are created in this format they can be enlarged without losing quality If you do not have 
a vector version of your logo available then you should make sure that your image is at 
least 1000 pixels wide 
	
Image libraries Photographs and images can be hosted online where the designer can 
access them with a login They can also be sent via Cloud file sharing services Make sure 
the images are of sufficient quality It is best practice to provide images that are 300dpi 
Although all images on the web are displayed at 72dpi a higher quality image will give 
your designer room to optimise and resize and crop or cut images where needed It may 
be necessary to consider different images for mobile vs desktop because the viewpoint 
on mobile is so much smaller You may need to consider using much fewer images for 
mobile or even none at all
If you dont own the image and its copyright it is illegal to use the image on your site 
without permission from the owner If you require these images they can be purchased 
from stock libraries online such as iStock or Shutterstock Avoid using images from 
Google Image Search on your pages 
	
Fonts folder You will need to provide both Apple Mac and PC versions of the fonts that 
are listed in your Style Guide Many designers work on Macs which use different font 
versions from those read by PCs 
	
Brand colours They need to be given to digital designers in RGB format RGB stands for 
red green and blue and is the standard for colours online 
	
Any existing creative assets that have been created for your brand over time such as 
	
Print designs 
	
TV ads 
The brand guidelines or style guide would 
be created in Illustrator PS or Sketch but 
saved for the client as a PDF
