lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture Snape was so
horrible to Harry Could Snape possibly know theyd found out about the
Sorcerers Stone Harry didnt see how he could  yet he sometimes had
the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds
Harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the
next afternoon that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether theyd ever
see him alive again This wasnt what youd call comforting Harry
hardly heard a word of Woods pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch
robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand
Ron and Hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to
Neville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim and worried or
why they had both brought their wands to the match Little did Harry
know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the LegLocker
Curse Theyd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville and were
ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry
Now dont forget its Locomotor Mortis Hermione muttered as Ron
slipped his wand up his sleeve
I know Ron snapped Dont nag
Back in the locker room Wood had taken Harry aside
Dont want to pressure you Potter but if we ever need an early
capture of the Snitch its now Finish the game before Snape can favor
Hufflepuff too much
The whole schools out there said Fred Weasley peering out of the
door Even  blimey  Dumbledores come to watch
Harrys heart did a somersault
Dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure Fred was right
There was no mistaking that silver beard
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe There was
simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was
watching
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched
onto the field something that Ron noticed too
