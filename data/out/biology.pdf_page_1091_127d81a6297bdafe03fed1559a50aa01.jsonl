neurotransmitter GABA gammaaminobutyric acid is released from a presynaptic neuron it binds to and opens
Cl channels Cl ions enter the cell and hyperpolarizes the membrane making the neuron less likely to fire an
action potential
Once neurotransmission has occurred the neurotransmitter must be removed from the synaptic cleft so the
postsynaptic membrane can reset and be ready to receive another signal This can be accomplished in three
ways the neurotransmitter can diffuse away from the synaptic cleft it can be degraded by enzymes in the
synaptic cleft or it can be recycled sometimes called reuptake by the presynaptic neuron Several drugs act
at this step of neurotransmission For example some drugs that are given to Alzheimers patients work by
inhibiting acetylcholinesterase the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine This inhibition of the enzyme essentially
increases neurotransmission at synapses that release acetylcholine Once released the acetylcholine stays in
the cleft and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors

Electrical Synapse
While electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical synapses they are found in all nervous systems
and play important and unique roles The mode of neurotransmission in electrical synapses is quite different from
that in chemical synapses In an electrical synapse the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are very close
together and are actually physically connected by channel proteins forming gap junctions Gap junctions allow
current to pass directly from one cell to the next In addition to the ions that carry this current other molecules
such as ATP can diffuse through the large gap junction pores
There are key differences between chemical and electrical synapses Because chemical synapses depend
on the release of neurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their signal there is an
approximately one millisecond delay between when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and
when the neurotransmitter leads to opening of postsynaptic ion channels Additionally this signaling is
unidirectional Signaling in electrical synapses in contrast is virtually instantaneous which is important for
synapses involved in key reflexes and some electrical synapses are bidirectional Electrical synapses are also
more reliable as they are less likely to be blocked and they are important for synchronizing the electrical activity
of a group of neurons For example electrical synapses in the thalamus are thought to regulate slowwave sleep
and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures
Signal Summation
Sometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron but
often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to
be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential This process is called summation and occurs at the
axon hillock as illustrated in Figure 3516 Additionally one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic
neuronssome excitatory and some inhibitoryso IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa It is the
net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its
threshold of excitation needed to fire an action potential Together synaptic summation and the threshold for
excitation act as a filter so that random noise in the system is not transmitted as important information
