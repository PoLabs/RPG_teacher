and impact of atheism agnosticism antireligious regimes alternative spiritual 
movements civil religions and immigrated religions also played a significant 
role As this chapter will show religion remained a highly relevant category 
in Europe whether on the side of the powerful as in Spain as an important 
differentiator of national identity as in Northern Ireland or as a target for 
oppression as in the case of the Holocaust or in the Balkan Wars
