Figure 4542 Group I the green solid line found food at the end of each trial group II the blue dashed line did not
find food for the first 6 days and group III the red dotted line did not find food during runs on the first three days
Notice that rats given food earlier learned faster and eventually caught up to the control group The orange dots on the
group II and III lines show the days when food rewards were added to the mazes
It may not be immediately obvious that this type of learning is different than conditioning Although one might be
tempted to believe that the rats simply learned how to find their way through a conditioned series of right and left
turns EC Tolman proved a decade later that the rats were making a representation of the maze in their minds
which he called a cognitive map This was an early demonstration of the power of cognitive learning and how
these abilities were not just limited to humans
Sociobiology
Sociobiology is an interdisciplinary science originally popularized by social insect researcher EO Wilson in the
1970s Wilson defined the science as the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social
organization

The main thrust of sociobiology is that animal and human behavior including aggressiveness
and other social interactions can be explained almost solely in terms of genetics and natural selection This
science is controversial noted scientists such as the late Stephen Jay Gould criticized the approach for ignoring
the environmental effects on behavior This is another example of the nature versus nurture debate of the role
of genetics versus the role of environment in determining an organisms characteristics
Sociobiology also links genes with behaviors and has been associated with biological determinism the belief
that all behaviors are hardwired into our genes No one disputes that certain behaviors can be inherited and that
natural selection plays a role retaining them It is the application of such principles to human behavior that sparks
this controversy which remains active today
