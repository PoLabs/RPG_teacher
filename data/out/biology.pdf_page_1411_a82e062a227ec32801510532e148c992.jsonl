Geological Climate Change
Global warming has been associated with at least one planetwide extinction event during the geological past
The Permian extinction event occurred about 251 million years ago toward the end of the roughly 50million
yearlong geological time span known as the Permian period This geologic time period was one of the three
warmest periods in Earths geologic history Scientists estimate that approximately 70 percent of the terrestrial
plant and animal species and 84 percent of marine species became extinct vanishing forever near the end of
the Permian period
Organisms that had adapted to wet and warm climatic conditions such as annual rainfall of 300400 cm
118157 in and 20 C30 C 68 F86 F in the tropical wet forest may not have been able to survive the
Permian climate change

warming on plant growth While scientists found that warmer temperatures in the 1980s and 1990s caused an
increase in plant productivity this advantage has since been counteracted by more frequent droughts
Present Climate Change
A number of global events have occurred that may be attributed to climate change during our lifetimes Glacier
National Park in Montana is undergoing the retreat of many of its glaciers a phenomenon known as glacier
recession In 1850 the area contained approximately 150 glaciers By 2010 however the park contained only
about 24 glaciers greater than 25 acres in size One of these glaciers is the Grinnell Glacier Figure 4430 at
Mount Gould Between 1966 and 2005 the size of Grinnell Glacier shrank by 40 percent Similarly the mass
of the ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic is decreasing Greenland lost 150250 km3 of ice per year
between 2002 and 2006 In addition the size and thickness of the Arctic sea ice is decreasing
Figure 4430 The effect of global warming can be seen in the continuing retreat of Grinnel Glacier The mean annual
temperature in the park has increased 133 C since 1900 The loss of a glacier results in the loss of summer
meltwaters sharply reducing seasonal water supplies and severely affecting local ecosystems credit modification of

This loss of ice is leading to increases in the global sea level On average the sea is rising at a rate of 18 mm
per year However between 1993 and 2010 the rate of sea level increase ranged between 29 and 34 mm per
year A variety of factors affect the volume of water in the ocean especially the temperature of the water the
density of water is related to its temperature water volume expands as it warms thus raising sea levels as well
as the amount of water found in rivers lakes glaciers polar ice caps and sea ice As glaciers and polar ice caps
melt there is a significant contribution of liquid water that was previously frozen
In addition to some abiotic conditions changing in response to climate change many organisms are also
being affected by the changes in temperature Temperature and precipitation play key roles in determining
