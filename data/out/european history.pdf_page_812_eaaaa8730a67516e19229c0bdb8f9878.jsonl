In the middle of the seventeenth century it was not a new idea to depict life as 
a staircase many versions of the ladder of life circulated in the early modern 
period based on lifestage theories that were rooted in the ancient period eg 
in the work by Ptolemeaus and Hippocrates and were frequently repeated 
and further developed afterwards by for example Augustinus Dante or 
Lemnius Many of these lifestage theories were collected in reference books 
such as Silva de varia leccin 1542 by the Spanish humanist Pedro Mexia 
14971551 and the Iconologia 1593 by the Italian iconographer Cesare Ripa 
15601622 published in Spanish and Italian respectively but translated into 
several languages throughout Europe As the collections of Maxia and Ripa 
demonstrate lifestage theories differed in the particular number of stages that 
they delineated between three and twelvebut often seven and the length of 
each stage which was sometimes fixed but was in other cases represented as 
rather fluid among other distinguishing factors 
What these theories share however was the idea that the stages of life are 
and should be distinguishable from each other as they all have their own typical 
characteristics Moreover the theorists all started from the assumption that age 
differentiation had a natural as opposed to social basis They often took their 
inspiration from the theory of the four humours developed by the physicians 
Hippocrates 460370 BC and Galenus 129199 and which experienced huge 
popularity throughout the medieval and early modern periods especially as 
a medical theory The general idea was that the human body consists of four 
humoursblood yellow bile black bile and phlegmthat directly correspond 
to the four elements with their own qualities air hot and moist fire hot and 
dry earth cold and dry water cold and moist The mixture of the four 
humours within the human body influenced an individuals health disease 
was considered to signify an imbalance between the four humours as well 
as their temperament for example someone with too much black bile in the 
body had a melancholic temperament However the desired balance between 
the humours varied according to changing circumstances including age The 
dominance of cold and dryness was characteristic for older people who were 
thus allowed to be slightly melancholic A young persons temperament on 
the other hand was naturally dominated by heat and moisture and could 
therefore be characterised as sanguine
This system of thought shaped views of age differentiation as a natural 
phenomenon it was considered a natural even physical process that 
compelled elderly people to display different behaviour than the young and 
which granted the aged qualities that youths were still unable to possess and
