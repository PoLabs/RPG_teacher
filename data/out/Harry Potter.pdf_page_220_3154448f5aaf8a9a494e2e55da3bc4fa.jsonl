So sorry your bloodiness Mr Baron Sir he said greasily My
mistake my mistake  I didnt see you  of course I didnt youre
invisible  forgive old Peevsie his little joke sir
I have business here Peeves croaked Harry Stay away from this
place tonight
I will sir I most certainly will said Peeves rising up in the air
again Hope your business goes well Baron Ill not bother you
And he scooted off
Brilliant Harry whispered Ron
A few seconds later they were there outside the thirdfloor corridor
 and the door was already ajar
Well there you are Harry said quietly Snapes already got past
Fluffy
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them
what was facing them Underneath the cloak Harry turned to the other
two
If you want to go back I wont blame you he said You can take the
cloak I wont need it now
Dont be stupid said Ron
Were coming said Hermione
Harry pushed the door open
As the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears All three of
the dogs noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it
couldnt see them
Whats that at its feet Hermione whispered
Looks like a harp said Ron Snape must have left it there
It must wake up the moment you stop playing said Harry Well here
goes
