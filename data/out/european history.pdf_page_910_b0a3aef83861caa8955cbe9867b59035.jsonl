Song Database at least 223 songs were written to this melody Both composers 
and playwrights used the song to write new pieces about love or morality or 
to express some misfortune Its prominence in song culture started in the 1560s 
and would continue into the eighteenth century and it can thus be considered 
an important song in the soundtrack of the early modern period
Sports and Games
The roots of sports and athletic competition are almost as old as mankind 
itself The first evidence of these pastimes in the form of cave paintings hails 
from the Palaeolithic era Among the first fields of athletic competition were 
several forms of martial arts with or without arms shooting or throwing any 
kinds of missile horse riding and chariot racing All of these skills were useful 
for warfare and combat From incidental contests in daily life several kinds 
of organised competitions developed like the ancient Olympic Games or 
gladiator battles and chariot races all over the Roman Empire The latter two of 
these practices were denounced and abandoned by the emergent Christianity 
of late antiquity Christian warriors nevertheless created their own culture 
of knighthood and chivalry which peaked in the High Middle Ages These 
cultures came to an end with the appearance of professional armies which led 
to a decline of armoured cavalry
Fencing and sharpshooter competitions as well as horse racing survived 
as legacies of the earlier era and all of these sports were favoured by the 
aristocracy Various forms of equestrian racing and competitions were practised 
across Europe and also beyond in the early modern age In Italy for instance 
several kinds of palios horse races were commonplace with Campo in Siena 
being the most famous The tradition of horse racing was very long and rich in 
England as well During the Commonwealth 16491660 it was temporarily 
abolished by Oliver Cromwell 15991658 in his position as Lord Protector 
since horses were needed for his New Model Army But after restoration of 
the monarchy Charles II 16301685 r 1660 took on the tradition of his Stuart 
predecessors and became one of the greatest equestrian enthusiasts making 
Newmarket Racecourse one of the cradles of modern horse racing
Boxing too has its roots in ancient forms of fighting and wrestling In 
contrast to sports practised mostly by aristocrats boxing was practised mainly 
by poor and underprivileged people Developing from local fights and brawls 
where strong men fought each other it evolved in early eighteenthcentury 
England into a sport with a standardised set of rules organised tournaments 
and widely recognised champions Famous champions were not only able to 
earn money but also ran boxing schools teaching their boxing techniques to 
curious young aristocrats These new participants in turn changed the sport
