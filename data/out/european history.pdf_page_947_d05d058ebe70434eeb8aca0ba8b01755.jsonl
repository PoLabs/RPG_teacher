Conclusion
In this chapter we have discussed how the past was used for building 
collective memory shaping identity political legitimation and fostering 
national identity Through these examples we have sought to show that there 
were many different ways in which memory couldand didplay a role in 
early modern society Here we have focused primarily on examples from the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries but such applications of the past continued 
in the eighteenth century as well during the Enlightenment philosophes would 
frequently refer to antiquity to support their arguments and the study of old 
and rare objects and their history would become a popular practice While 
the usage of memory continues to shift and evolve over time in many ways it 
continues to fulfill a key function in European society
