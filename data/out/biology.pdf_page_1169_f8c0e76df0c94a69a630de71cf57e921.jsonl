Figure 3712 Parathyroid hormone PTH is released in response to low blood calcium levels It increases blood
calcium levels by targeting the skeleton the kidneys and the intestine credit modification of work by Mikael

Hyperparathyroidism results from an overproduction of parathyroid hormone This results in excessive calcium
being removed from bones and introduced into blood circulation producing structural weakness of the bones
which can lead to deformation and fractures plus nervous system impairment due to high blood calcium levels
Hypoparathyroidism the underproduction of PTH results in extremely low levels of blood calcium which causes
impaired muscle function and may result in tetany severe sustained muscle contraction
The hormone calcitonin which is produced by the parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid has the opposite
effect on blood calcium levels as does PTH Calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts
stimulating osteoblasts and stimulating calcium excretion by the kidneys This results in calcium being added
to the bones to promote structural integrity Calcitonin is most important in children when it stimulates bone
growth during pregnancy when it reduces maternal bone loss and during prolonged starvation because it
reduces bone mass loss In healthy nonpregnant unstarved adults the role of calcitonin is unclear
Hormonal Regulation of Growth
Hormonal regulation is required for the growth and replication of most cells in the body Growth hormone GH
produced by the anterior portion of the pituitary gland accelerates the rate of protein synthesis particularly in
skeletal muscle and bones Growth hormone has direct and indirect mechanisms of action The first direct action
of GH is stimulation of triglyceride breakdown lipolysis and release into the blood by adipocytes This results in
a switch by most tissues from utilizing glucose as an energy source to utilizing fatty acids This process is called
a glucosesparing effect In another direct mechanism GH stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver the
glycogen is then released into the blood as glucose Blood glucose levels increase as most tissues are utilizing
fatty acids instead of glucose for their energy needs The GH mediated increase in blood glucose levels is called
a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose levels seen in diabetes mellitus
The indirect mechanism of GH action is mediated by insulinlike growth factors IGFs or somatomedins
which are a family of growthpromoting proteins produced by the liver which stimulates tissue growth IGFs
