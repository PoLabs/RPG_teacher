Kidney Structure
Externally the kidneys are surrounded by three layers illustrated in Figure 415 The outermost layer is a tough
connective tissue layer called the renal fascia The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule which
helps anchor the kidneys in place The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule Internally the kidney
has three regionsan outer cortex a medulla in the middle and the renal pelvis in the region called the
hilum of the kidney The hilum is the concave part of the beanshape where blood vessels and nerves enter
and exit the kidney it is also the point of exit for the ureters The renal cortex is granular due to the presence of
nephronsthe functional unit of the kidney The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses called
the renal pyramids In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels
pass The tips of the pyramids called renal papillae point toward the renal pelvis There are on average eight
renal pyramids in each kidney The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the lobes
of the kidney The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney On the inside of the kidney the
renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces which further branch into the
minor calyces The ureters are urinebearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder
