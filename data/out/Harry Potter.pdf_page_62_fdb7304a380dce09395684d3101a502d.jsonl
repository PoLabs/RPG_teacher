Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him
chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts
Whats up said Hagrid
Nothing Harry lied They stopped to buy parchment and quills Harry
cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you
wrote When they had left the shop he said Hagrid whats Quidditch
Blimey Harry I keep forgettin how little yeh know  not knowin
about Quidditch
Dont make me feel worse said Harry He told Hagrid about the pate
boy in Madam Malkins
and he said people from Muggle families shouldnt even be allowed
in
Yer not from a Muggle family If hed known who yeh were  hes grown
up knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin folk You saw what
everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh Anyway what
does he know about it some o the best I ever saw were the only ones
with magic in em in a long line 0 Muggles  look at yer mum Look
what she had fer a sister
So what is Quidditch
Its our sport Wizard sport Its like  like soccer in the Muggle
world  everyone follows Quidditch  played up in the air on
broomsticks and theres four balls  sorta hard ter explain the rules
And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff
School houses Theres four Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o
duffers but

Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin said Hagrid darkly Theres not a
