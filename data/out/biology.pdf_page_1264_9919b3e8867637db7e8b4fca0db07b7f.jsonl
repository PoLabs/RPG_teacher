Figure 404 a Fish have the simplest circulatory systems of the vertebrates blood flows unidirectionally from the two
chambered heart through the gills and then the rest of the body b Amphibians have two circulatory routes one for
oxygenation of the blood through the lungs and skin and the other to take oxygen to the rest of the body The blood
is pumped from a threechambered heart with two atria and a single ventricle c Reptiles also have two circulatory
routes however blood is only oxygenated through the lungs The heart is three chambered but the ventricles are
partially separated so some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood occurs except in crocodilians and birds
d Mammals and birds have the most efficient heart with four chambers that completely separate the oxygenated and
deoxygenated blood it pumps only oxygenated blood through the body and deoxygenated blood to the lungs
As illustrated in Figure 404a Fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a twochambered heart that has
only a single atrium and a single ventricle The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and
the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is reoxygenated this
is called gill circulation The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the
atrium this is called systemic circulation This unidirectional flow of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated
to deoxygenated blood around the fishs systemic circuit The result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can
reach some of the organs and tissues of the body reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish
In amphibians reptiles birds and mammals blood flow is directed in two circuits one through the lungs and
