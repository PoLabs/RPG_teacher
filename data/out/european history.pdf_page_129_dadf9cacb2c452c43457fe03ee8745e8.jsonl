Introduction
The nineteenth century was the age of an unprecedented global transformation 
In the period between 1800 and the 1910s the world grew closer through 
advancements in transport and communications while on the other hand 
political and cultural differences became more visible At the beginning of the 
century a small number of European empires controlled thirtyfive percent of 
the worlds landmass but by the 1860s this number had risen to sixty percent 
and in 1914 to an astonishing eightyfive percent This was both the result and 
the cause of new spaces and frontiers opening between different modes of 
power geopolitical economic military and technological For example while 
Asian societies had supplied over sixty percent of the worlds gross domestic 
product in 1700 by 1913 this share amounted to only 245 percent and it was 
Europeans who now claimed the commanding share of global GDP at 683 
percent The rise of Europe as the worlds dominant power profoundly shaped 
the way that Europeans understood the rest of the world and themselves Yet 
at the same time they had to contend with the rise of new nonEuropean 
players on the world stage such as the United States and Japan that were 
poised to make their mark on the following century
