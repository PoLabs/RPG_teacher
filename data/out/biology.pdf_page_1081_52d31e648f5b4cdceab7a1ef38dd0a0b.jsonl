Neurogenesis
At one time scientists believed that people were born with all the neurons they would ever have Research
performed during the last few decades indicates that neurogenesis the birth of new neurons continues
into adulthood Neurogenesis was first discovered in songbirds that produce new neurons while learning
songs For mammals new neurons also play an important role in learning about 1000 new neurons
develop in the hippocampus a brain structure involved in learning and memory each day While most of
the new neurons will die researchers found that an increase in the number of surviving new neurons in
the hippocampus correlated with how well rats learned a new task Interestingly both exercise and some
antidepressant medications also promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus Stress has the opposite effect
While neurogenesis is quite limited compared to regeneration in other tissues research in this area may
lead to new treatments for disorders such as Alzheimers stroke and epilepsy
How do scientists identify new neurons A researcher can inject a compound called bromodeoxyuridine
BrdU into the brain of an animal While all cells will be exposed to BrdU BrdU will only be incorporated
into the DNA of newly generated cells that are in S phase A technique called immunohistochemistry can
be used to attach a fluorescent label to the incorporated BrdU and a researcher can use fluorescent
microscopy to visualize the presence of BrdU and thus new neurons in brain tissue Figure 356 is a
micrograph which shows fluorescently labeled neurons in the hippocampus of a rat
Figure 356 This micrograph shows fluorescently labeled new neurons in a rat hippocampus Cells that are
actively dividing have bromodoxyuridine BrdU incorporated into their DNA and are labeled in red Cells that
express glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP are labeled in green Astrocytes but not neurons express GFAP
Thus cells that are labeled both red and green are actively dividing astrocytes whereas cells labeled red only
are actively dividing neurons credit modification of work by Dr Maryam Faiz et al University of Barcelona

This site httpopenstaxcollegeorglneurogenesis contains more information about neurogenesis
including an interactive laboratory simulation and a video that explains how BrdU labels new cells
Glia
While glia are often thought of as the supporting cast of the nervous system the number of glial cells in the brain
