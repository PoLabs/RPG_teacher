CHAPTER SUMMARY
201 Organizing Life on Earth
Scientists continually gain new information that helps understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth Each
group of organisms went through its own evolutionary journey or its phylogeny Each organism shares
relatedness with others and based on morphologic and genetic evidence scientists attempt to map the
evolutionary pathways of all life on Earth Historically scientists organized organisms into a taxonomic
classification system However today many scientists build phylogenetic trees to illustrate evolutionary
relationships
202 Determining Evolutionary Relationships
To build phylogenetic trees scientists must collect accurate information that allows them to make evolutionary
connections between organisms Using morphologic and molecular data scientists work to identify homologous
characteristics and genes Similarities between organisms can stem either from shared evolutionary history
homologies or from separate evolutionary paths analogies Scientists can use newer technologies to help
distinguish homologies from analogies After identifying homologous information scientists use cladistics to
organize these events as a means to determine an evolutionary timeline They then apply the concept of
maximum parsimony which states that the order of events probably occurred in the most obvious and simple
way with the least amount of steps For evolutionary events this would be the path with the least number of
major divergences that correlate with the evidence
203 Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Tree
The phylogenetic tree which Darwin first used is the classic tree of life model describing phylogenetic
relationships among species and the most common model that scientists use today New ideas about HGT
and genome fusion have caused some to suggest revising the model to resemble webs or rings
