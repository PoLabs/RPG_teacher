the other hand to the codonts reptiles dinosaurs and birds Many marine vertebrates became extinct near
the end of the Devonian period which ended about 360 million years ago and both marine and terrestrial
vertebrates were decimated by a mass extinction in the early Permian period about 250 million years ago

Identify the characteristics of reptiles

Discuss the evolution of reptiles
The reptiles including dinosaurs and birds are distinguished from amphibians by their terrestrially adapted egg
which is supported by four extraembryonic membranes the yolk sac the amnion the chorion and the allantois
Figure 2922 The chorion and amnion develop from folds in the body wall and the yolk sac and allantois
are extensions of the midgut and hindgut respectively The amnion forms a fluidfilled cavity that provides the
embryo with its own internal aquatic environment The evolution of the extraembryonic membranes led to less
dependence on water for development and thus allowed the amniotes to branch out into drier environments
In addition to these membranes the eggs of birds reptiles and a few mammals have shells An amniote
embryo was then enclosed in the amnion which was in turn encased in an extraembryonic coelom contained
within the chorion Between the shell and the chorion was the albumin of the egg which provided additional fluid
and cushioning This was a significant development that further distinguishes the amniotes from amphibians
which were and continue to be restricted to moist environments due their shellless eggs Although the shells
of various reptilian amniotic species vary significantly they all permit the retention of water and nutrients for the
developing embryo The egg shells of bird avian reptiles are hardened with calcium carbonate making them
rigid but fragile The shells of most nonavian reptile eggs such as turtles are leathery and require a moist
environment Most mammals do not lay eggs except for monotremes such as the echindnas and platypuses
Instead the embryo grows within the mothers body with the placenta derived from two of the extraembryonic
membranes
Characteristics of Amniotes
The amniotic egg is the key characteristic of amniotes In amniotes that lay eggs the shell of the egg provides
protection for the developing embryo while being permeable enough to allow for the exchange of carbon dioxide
and oxygen The albumin or egg white outside of the chorion provides the embryo with water and protein
whereas the fattier egg yolk contained in the yolk sac provides nutrients for the embryo as is the case with the
eggs of many other animals such as amphibians Here are the functions of the extraembryonic membranes
1
Blood vessels in the yolk sac transport yolk nutrients to the circulatory system of the embryo
2
The chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the eggs external
environment
3
The allantois stores nitrogenous wastes produced by the embryo and also facilitates respiration
