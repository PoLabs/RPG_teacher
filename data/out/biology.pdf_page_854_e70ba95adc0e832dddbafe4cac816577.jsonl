284 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa Molluscs and Annelids
Phylum Mollusca is a large group of protostome schizocoelous invertebrates that occupy marine freshwater
and terrestrial habitats Mollusks can be divided into seven classes each of which exhibits variations on the
basic molluscan body plan Two defining features are the mantle which secretes a protective calcareous shell
in many species and the radula a rasping feeding organ found in most classes Some mollusks have evolved
a reduced shell and others have no radula The mantle also covers the body and forms a mantle cavity which
is quite distinct from the coelomic cavitytypically reduced to the area surrounding the heart kidneys and
intestine In aquatic mollusks respiration is facilitated by gills ctenidia in the mantle cavity In terrestrial
mollusks the mantle cavity itself serves as an organ of gas exchange Mollusks also have a muscular foot
which is modified in various ways for locomotion or food capture Most mollusks have separate sexes Early
development in aquatic species occurs via one or more larval stages including a trochophore larva that
precedes a veliger larva in some groups
Phylum Annelida includes vermiform segmented animals Segmentation is metameric ie each segment is
partitioned internally as well as externally with various structures repeated in each segment These animals
have welldeveloped neuronal circulatory and digestive systems The two major groups of annelids are the
polychaetes which have parapodia with multiple bristles and oligochaetes which have no parapodia and
fewer bristles or no bristles Oligochaetes which include earthworms and leeches have a specialized band of
segments known as a clitellum which secretes a cocoon and protects gametes during reproduction The
leeches do not have full internal segmentation Reproductive strategies include separate sexes
hermaphroditism and serial hermaphroditism Polychaetes typically have trochophore larvae while the
oligochaetes develop more directly
285 Superphylum Ecdysozoa Nematodes and Tardigrades
The defining feature of the Ecdysozoa is a collagenouschitinous cuticle that covers the body and the necessity
to molt the cuticle periodically during growth Nematodes are roundworms with a pseudocoel body cavity They
have a complete digestive system a differentiated nervous system and a rudimentory excretory system The
phylum includes freeliving species like Caenorhabditis elegans as well as many species of endoparasitic
organisms such as Ascaris spp They include dioeceous as well as hermaphroditic species Embryonic
development proceeds via several larval stages and most adults have a fixed number of cells
The tardigrades sometimes called water bears are a widespread group of tiny animals with a segmented
cuticle covering the epidermis and four pairs of clawed legs Like the nematodes they are pseudocoelomates
and have a fixed number of cells as adults Specialized proteins enable them to enter cryptobiosis a kind of
suspended animation during which they can resist a number of adverse environmental conditions
286 Superphylum Ecdysozoa Arthropods
Arthropods represent the most successful animal phylum on Earth both in terms of the number of species and
the number of individuals As members of the Ecdysozoa all arthropods have a protective chitinous cuticle that
must be periodically molted and shed during development or growth Arthropods are characterized by a
segmented body as well as the presence of jointed appendages In the basic body plan a pair of appendages
is present per body segment Within the phylum traditional classification is based on mouthparts body
subdivisions number of appendages and modifications of appendages present In aquatic arthropods the
chitinous exoskeleton may be calcified Gills tracheae and book lungs facilitate respiration Unique larval
stages are commonly seen in both aquatic and terrestrial groups of arthropods
287 Superphylum Deuterostomia
Echinoderms are deuterostome marine organisms whose adults show fivefold symmetry This phylum of
animals has a calcareous endoskeleton composed of ossicles or body plates Epidermal spines are attached
to some ossicles and serve in a protective capacity Echinoderms possess a watervascular system that serves
both for respiration and for locomotion although other respiratory structures such as papulae and respiratory
trees are found in some species A large aboral madreporite is the point of entry and exit for sea water pumped
into the water vascular system Echinoderms have a variety of feeding techniques ranging from predation to
suspension feeding Osmoregulation is carried out by specialized cells known as podocytes associated with the
hemal system
The characteristic features of the Chordata are a notochord a dorsal hollow nerve cord pharyngeal slits a
postanal tail and an endostylethyroid that secretes iodinated hormones The phylum Chordata contains two
