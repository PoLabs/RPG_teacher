CHAPTER SUMMARY
171 Biotechnology
Nucleic acids can be isolated from cells for the purposes of further analysis by breaking open the cells and
enzymatically destroying all other major macromolecules Fragmented or whole chromosomes can separate on
the basis of size by gel electrophoresis PCR can amplify short DNA or RNA stretches Researchers can use
Southern and Northern blotting to detect the presence of specific short sequences in a DNA or RNA sample
The term cloning may refer to cloning small DNA fragments molecular cloning cloning cell populations
cellular cloning or cloning entire organisms reproductive cloning Medical professionals perform genetic
testing to identify diseasecausing genes and use gene therapy to cure an inheritable disease
Transgenic organisms possess DNA from a different species usually generated by molecular cloning
techniques Vaccines antibiotics and hormones are examples of products obtained by recombinant DNA
technology Scientists usually create transgenic plants to improve crop plant characteristics
172 Mapping Genomes
Genome mapping is similar to solving a big complicated puzzle with pieces of information coming from
laboratories all over the world Genetic maps provide an outline for locating genes within a genome and they
estimate the distance between genes and genetic markers on the basis of recombination frequencies during
meiosis Physical maps provide detailed information about the physical distance between the genes The most
detailed information is available through sequence mapping Researchers combine information from all
mapping and sequencing sources to study an entire genome
173 WholeGenome Sequencing
Wholegenome sequencing is the latest available resource to treat genetic diseases Some doctors are using
wholegenome sequencing to save lives Genomics has many industrial applications including biofuel
development agriculture pharmaceuticals and pollution control The basic principle of all modernday
sequencing strategies involves the chain termination method of sequencing
Although the human genome sequences provide key insights to medical professionals researchers use whole
genome sequences of model organisms to better understand the species genome Automation and the
decreased cost of wholegenome sequencing may lead to personalized medicine in the future
