Organismal Ecology
Researchers studying ecology at the organismal level are interested in the adaptations that enable individuals
to live in specific habitats These adaptations can be morphological physiological and behavioral For instance
the Karner blue butterfly Lycaeides melissa samuelis Figure 443 is considered a specialist because the
females only oviposit that is lay eggs on wild lupine Lupinus perennis This specific requirement and
adaptation means that the Karner blue butterfly is completely dependent on the presence of wild lupine plants
for its survival
Figure 443 The Karner blue butterfly Lycaeides melissa samuelis is a rare butterfly that lives only in open areas
with few trees or shrubs such as pine barrens and oak savannas It can only lay its eggs on lupine plants credit

After hatching the first instar caterpillars emerge and spend four to six weeks feeding solely on wild lupine
Figure 444 The caterpillars pupate as a chrysalis to undergo the final stage of metamorphosis and emerge
as butterflies after about four weeks The adult butterflies feed on the nectar of flowers of wild lupine and other
plant species such as milkweeds Generally there are two broods of the Karner blue each year
A researcher interested in studying Karner blue butterflies at the organismal level might in addition to asking
questions about egg laying requirements ask questions about the butterflies preferred thoracic flight
temperature a physiological question or the behavior of the caterpillars when they are at different larval stages
a behavioral question
