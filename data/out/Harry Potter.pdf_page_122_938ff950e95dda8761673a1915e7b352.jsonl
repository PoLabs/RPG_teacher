Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome
turned up Malfoy flanked by Crabbe and Goyle
Having a last meal Potter When are you getting the train back to the
Muggles
Youre a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got
your little friends with you said Harry coolly There was of course
nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle but as the High Table was
full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their
knuckles and scowl
Id take you on anytime on my own said Malfoy Tonight if you want
Wizards duel Wands only  no contact Whats the matter Never heard
of a wizards duel before I suppose
Of course he has said Ron wheeling around Im his second whos
yours
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle sizing them up
Crabbe he said Midnight all right Well meet you in the trophy
room thats always unlocked
When Malfoy had gone Ron and Harry looked at each other What is a
wizards duel said Harry And what do you mean youre my second
Well a seconds there to take over if you die said Ron casually
getting started at last on his cold pie Catching the look on Harrys
face he added quickly But people only die in proper duels you know
with real wizards The most you and Malfoyll be able to do is send
sparks at each other Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real
damage I bet he expected you to refuse anyway
And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens
Throw it away and punch him on the nose Ron suggested Excuse me
They both looked up It was Hermione Granger
Cant a person eat in peace in this place said Ron
