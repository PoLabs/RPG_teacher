slipped off fer a pickmeup in the Leaky Cauldron I hate them
Gringotts carts He did still look a bit sick so Harry entered Madam
Malkins shop alone feeling nervous
Madam Malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve
Hogwarts clear she said when Harry started to speak Got the lot
here  another young man being fitted up just now in fact 
In the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on
a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes Madam
Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his
head and began to pin it to the right length
Hello said the boy Hogwarts too
Yes said Harry
My fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street
looking at wands said the boy He had a bored drawling voice Then
Im going to drag them off to took at racing brooms I dont see why
first years cant have their own I think Ill bully father into getting
me one and Ill smuggle it in somehow
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley
Have you got your own broom the boy went on
No said Harry
Play Quidditch at all
No Harry said again wondering what on earth Quidditch could be
I do  Father says its a crime if Im not picked to play for my
house and I must say I agree Know what house youll be in yet
No said Harry feeling more stupid by the minute
Well no one really knows until they get there do they but I know
Ill be in Slytherin all our family have been  imagine being in
Hufflepuff I think Id leave wouldnt you Mmm said Harry wishing
he could say something a bit more interesting
