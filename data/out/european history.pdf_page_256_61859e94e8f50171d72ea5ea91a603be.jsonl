Racial and Entangled Inequalities
Along with gender and sex race has become one of the central categories 
for understanding and critiquing inequality throughout history and in the 
contemporary world Importantly it was in early modern Europe that the 
concept of race first gained traction but it meant something different from 
how we understand the concept today Race has obscure origins appearing 
in many European vernaculars by at least the fifteenth century where it 
originally referred to the lineage of prized animals such as dogs and birds of 
prey and soon thereafter to noble families Race understood to mean major 
groupings within the human species based on shared physical characteristics 
or ancestry or both was a seventeenthcentury innovation while the older 
meaning maintained dominance until at least the end of the eighteenth century 
Although the nobility of the Second Estate did not consider itself distinct in 
physiognomy from others as the modern concept of race would imply they 
did generally consider themselves naturally born leaders and biologically 
superior As the seventeenthcentury French writer Nicolas Faret 16001646 
stated 
Those who are well born ordinarily have good inclinations which others only rarely have 
and it seems that they come naturally to those of good birth whereas it is only by accident 
that they are found in others For in the blood flow the seeds of good and evil which sprout 
in time to produce all the good and bad qualities that cause us to be loved or hated by 
everyone
It is important to note that this ideal of the nobility as a closed social caste 
never wholly conformed with reality because warfare high mortality rates 
and political instability made a selfreproducing and sealedoff Second 
Estate impossible to maintain Ranging from as much as ten percent of the 
population in Eastern Europe to as little as one percent in Western Europe 
across the early modern period nobles embodied and relied upon forms 
of inequality that evolved significantly from 1500 to 1800 They began as a 
wealthy landowning and warrior class that received special privileges such 
as tax exemptions But the traditional shape of noble power was threatened by 
the centralisation of increasingly powerful states the advent of capitalism and 
the emergence of a humanist culture that valued civility Some nobles were 
unable to adapt to this new social and political world and lost much of their 
wealth and power but leading historians have shown that a great many noble 
families were able to accommodate themselves to the novel situation using 
their wealth in obtaining a classical education and buying the venal offices that 
were necessary to maintain political power in a world of centralising states
The rise of modern racist or racialist views of inequality especially 
white supremacy developed slowly and in complicated ways across the
