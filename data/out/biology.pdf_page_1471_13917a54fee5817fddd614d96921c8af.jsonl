Ecosystems are complex with many interacting parts They are routinely exposed to various disturbances or
changes in the environment that effect their compositions yearly variations in rainfall and temperature and
the slower processes of plant growth which may take several years Many of these disturbances result from
natural processes For example when lightning causes a forest fire and destroys part of a forest ecosystem the
ground is eventually populated by grasses then by bushes and shrubs and later by mature trees restoring the
forest to its former state The impact of environmental disturbances caused by human activities is as important
as the changes wrought by natural processes Human agricultural practices air pollution acid rain global
deforestation overfishing eutrophication oil spills and waste dumping on land and into the ocean are all issues
of concern to conservationists
Equilibrium is the steady state of an ecosystem where all organisms are in balance with their environment
and with each other In ecology two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems resistance and
resilience Resistance is the ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances Resilience
is the speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed Ecosystem resistance and
resilience are especially important when considering human impact The nature of an ecosystem may change
to such a degree that it can lose its resilience entirely This process can lead to the complete destruction or
irreversible altering of the ecosystem
Food Chains and Food Webs
The term food chain is sometimes used metaphorically to describe human social situations Individuals who
are considered successful are seen as being at the top of the food chain consuming all others for their benefit
whereas the less successful are seen as being at the bottom
The scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage In ecology a food
chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass primary producers primary
consumers and higherlevel consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics There is a
single path through the chain Each organism in a food chain occupies what is called a trophic level Depending
on their role as producers or consumers species or groups of species can be assigned to various trophic levels
In many ecosystems the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms plants andor
phytoplankton which are called primary producers The organisms that consume the primary producers
are herbivores the primary consumers Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary
consumers Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores Higherlevel consumers feed on the
next lower tropic levels and so on up to the organisms at the top of the food chain the apex consumers In the
Lake Ontario food chain shown in Figure 464 the Chinook salmon is the apex consumer at the top of this food
chain
