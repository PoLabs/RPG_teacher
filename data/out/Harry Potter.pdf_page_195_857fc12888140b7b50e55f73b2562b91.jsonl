Dont tell me what I can and cant do Potter Now get back to bed all
of you Ive never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students
A hundred and fifty points lost That put Gryffindor in last place In
one night theyd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house
cup Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach How
could they ever make up for this
Harry didnt sleep all night He could hear Neville sobbing into his
pillow for what seemed like hours Harry couldnt think of anything to
say to comfort him He knew Neville like himself was dreading the
dawn What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what
theyd done
At first Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the
house points the next day thought thered been a mistake How could they
suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday And then
the story started to spread Harry Potter the famous Harry Potter
their hero of two Quidditch matches had lo st them all those points
him and a couple of other stupid first years
From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school
Harry was suddenly the most hated Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs
turned on him because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose
the house cup Everywhere Harry went people pointed and didnt trouble
to lower their voices as they insulted him Slytherins on the other
hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering Thanks
Potter we owe you one
Only Ron stood by him
Theyll all forget this in a few weeks Fred and George have lost loads
of points in all the time theyve been here and people still like
them
Theyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have
they said Harry miserably
Well  no Ron admitted
It was a bit late to repair the damage but Harry swore to himself not
to meddle in things that werent his business from now on Hed had it
