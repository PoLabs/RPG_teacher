scale ranging from zero to 14 that is inversely proportional to the hydrogen ions concentration in a
solution
type of covalent bond that forms as a result of unequal electron sharing resulting in
creating slightly positive and negative charged molecule regions
molecule that is result of chemical reaction
positively charged particle that resides in the atoms nucleus has a mass of one amu and a charge of
1
isotope that emits radiation comprised of subatomic particles to form more stable elements
molecule that takes part in a chemical reaction
chemical reaction that functions bidirectionally where products may turn into
reactants if their concentration is great enough
substance capable of dissolving another substance
the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its
temperature by one degree Celsius
when a polar water molecule surrounds charged or polar molecules thus keeping them
dissolved and in solution
molecules that share a chemical formula but differ in the placement of their chemical bonds
hydrocarbon chain or ring containing an atom of another element in place of one of
the backbone carbons
tension at the surface of a body of liquid that prevents the molecules from separating created
by the attractive cohesive forces between the liquids molecules
outermost shell of an atom
very weak interaction between molecules due to temporary charges attracting
atoms that are very close together
CHAPTER SUMMARY
21 Atoms Isotopes Ions and Molecules The Building Blocks
Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass It is comprised of elements All of the 98 elements that
occur naturally have unique qualities that allow them to combine in various ways to create molecules which in
turn combine to form cells tissues organ systems and organisms Atoms which consist of protons neutrons
and electrons are the smallest units of an element that retain all of the properties of that element Electrons
can transfer share or cause charge disparities between atoms to create bonds including ionic covalent and
hydrogen bonds as well as van der Waals interactions
