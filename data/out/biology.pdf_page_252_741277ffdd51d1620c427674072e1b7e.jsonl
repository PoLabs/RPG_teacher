Photosynthesis
During the evolution of photosynthesis a major shift occurred from the bacterial type of photosynthesis
that involves only one photosystem and is typically anoxygenic does not generate oxygen into modern
oxygenic does generate oxygen photosynthesis employing two photosystems This modern oxygenic
photosynthesis is used by many organismsfrom giant tropical leaves in the rainforest to tiny
cyanobacterial cellsand the process and components of this photosynthesis remain largely the same
Photosystems absorb light and use electron transport chains to convert energy into the chemical energy of
ATP and NADH The subsequent lightindependent reactions then assemble carbohydrate molecules with
this energy
In the harsh dry heat of the desert plants must conserve every drop of water must be used to survive
Because stomata must open to allow for the uptake of CO2 water escapes from the leaf during active
photosynthesis Desert plants have evolved processes to conserve water and deal with harsh conditions
Mechanisms to capture and store CO2 allows plants to adapt to living with less water Some plants such as
cacti Figure 819 can prepare materials for photosynthesis during the night by a temporary carbon fixation
storage process because opening the stomata at this time conserves water due to cooler temperatures
During the day cacti use the captured CO2 for photosynthesis and keep their stomata closed
