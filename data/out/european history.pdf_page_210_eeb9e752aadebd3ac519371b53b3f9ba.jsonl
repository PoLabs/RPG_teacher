Republic of Yugoslavia 19451992 drew a distinction between nation narod 
nacija and nationality narodnost with the former term applying only to 
Serbs Croats Slovenes Muslims Montenegrins and Macedonians all of 
whom spoke Slavic languages and were considered the constitutive people 
of the multiethnic state However residents of the same state who identified as 
Hungarian Albanian Romani Jewish Czech German Romanian Bulgarian 
Slovak Turk Rusyn Italian Vlach or otherwise were considered to belong 
to a nationality narodnost instead implying that their true homeland lay 
beyond the borders of Jugoslavija literally the land of South Slavs 
Across Europe in the twentieth century as in earlier periods a commonly 
accepted uniform definition of ethnicity never emerged most often the 
term was related to markers of difference such as religion language origin 
culture or some combination of these attributes Religion for instance is still 
a decisive feature of identity in Northern Ireland according to the 2011 census 
the majority of Roman Catholics 572 percent identified as Irish while most 
Protestants 816 percent declared themselves British In the Balkans religious 
affiliation is often the most prominent marker before language as the case of 
BosniaHerzegovina shows where Bosniaksknown until 1993 as Muslims 
Muslimaniare traditionally Sunni Muslims whereas Serbs are Orthodox 
Christians and Croats are Roman Catholics However the situation is radically 
different in nearby Albania where Muslim Orthodox Catholic Bektashi and 
atheist Albanian speakers identify as Albanians regardless of their respective 
religious traditions
Language is the decisive identity marker for Germanys Slavicspeaking 
Sorbs as well as for Frisians who speak a Germanic dialect In Spain and 
France the Basque minority speaks a language unrelated to that of the 
dominant surrounding communities In Belgium the two major population 
groups speak either French or Flemish but neither is usually referred to 
as an ethnic groupinstead they are mostly referred to as Walloons and 
Flemings or collectively as Belgians This example from the European Unions 
institutional centre draws attention to the widespread Eurocentric habit of 
applying the label of ethnicity overwhelmingly to marginalised and minority 
groupsparticularly outside of Europe and in supposedly peripheral regions 
such as the Balkansbut not to larger groups and majority populations in 
Western Europe 
In other cases like the Swedish Norwegian and Sami peoples of 
Scandinavia ethnicity is not only marked by linguistic difference but also 
by reference to different origins and origin myths Cultural difference might 
be associated with religious difference as in the case of Bulgarias Muslim 
Turkish minority However for the Sarakatsani people of Greece North 
Macedonia Bulgaria and Albania cultural difference is associated with a
