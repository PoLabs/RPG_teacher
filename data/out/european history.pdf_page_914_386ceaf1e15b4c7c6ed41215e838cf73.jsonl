way it was perceived For many people sport became not only an activity for 
fun and leisure but also a means of earning money playing sports emerged as 
a profession As early as the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries 
professional boxers jockeys or cricketers were hired to fight or compete not 
only for prizes and rewards but also for regular salaries
With the increasing competitiveness of sports the meaning of terms such 
as measuring or recording shifted due to their use in the sporting context 
Rather than viewing competition as the main feature of sports some humanist 
philosophers such as the Czech thinker John Amos Comenius 15921670 
emphasised its pedagogical capacities In works such as Schola ludus seu 
Encyclopaedia viva 1656 or Orbis pictus 1658 Comenius emphasised that 
physical activity and gameplaying were important not only for physical 
development but also for intellectual development see also Chapter 641 
Games were an integral part of education permitting children under a 
teachers supervision to acquire new knowledge faster and more easily On 
the other hand Comenius always saw sport and games as a means of education 
and relaxation he never considered them the most important or fulfilling part 
of life This contrasted with the competitive or combatant attitude to sports 
which emerged in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
Conclusion
Sports and leisure activities changed considerably during late medieval and 
early modern times Many of them grew from local forms whose performance 
and practice were restricted to particular regions to widespread pastimes 
crossing national and cultural borders The growing interconnection of the 
world during the early modern period allowed particular musical instruments 
theatrical forms games and sports to spread and gain popularity across the 
globe For the same reason particular tunes and plays became popular across 
various countries as well Physical activities that had their origins in combat 
and war were increasingly reinvented or reshaped as sporting activities with 
the new goal of leisure and recreation instead of conquest As sports and 
entertainment became more commercial these activities were professionalised 
with actors and athletes earning their income by providing spectators with 
their moment of leisure
