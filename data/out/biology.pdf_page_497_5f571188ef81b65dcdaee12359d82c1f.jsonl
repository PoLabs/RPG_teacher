174 Applying Genomics
Imagination is the only barrier to the applicability of genomics Researchers are applying genomics to most
fields of biology They use it for personalized medicine prediction of disease risks at an individual level
studying drug interactions before conducting clinical trials and studying microorganisms in the environment as
opposed to the laboratory They are also applying it to developments such as generating new biofuels
genealogical assessment using mitochondria advances in forensic science and improvements in agriculture
175 Genomics and Proteomics
Proteomics is the study of the entire set of proteins expressed by a given type of cell under certain
environmental conditions In a multicellular organism different cell types will have different proteomes and
these will vary with environmental changes Unlike a genome a proteome is dynamic and in constant flux
which makes it both more complicated and more useful than the knowledge of genomes alone
Proteomics approaches rely on protein analysis Researchers are constantly upgrading these techniques
Researchers have used proteomics to study different cancer types Medical professionals are using different
biomarkers and protein signatures to analyze each cancer type The future goal is to have a personalized
treatment plan for each individual
VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS
1 Figure 177 You are working in a molecular
biology lab and unbeknownst to you your lab
partner left the foreign genomic DNA that you are
planning to clone on the lab bench overnight instead
of storing it in the freezer As a result it was
degraded by nucleases but still used in the
experiment The plasmid on the other hand is fine
What results would you expect from your molecular
cloning experiment
a
There will be no colonies on the bacterial
plate
b
There will be blue colonies only
c
There will be blue and white colonies
d
The will be white colonies only
2 Figure 178 Do you think Dolly was a FinnDorset
or a Scottish Blackface sheep
3 Figure 1715 In 2011 the United States
Preventative Services Task Force recommended
against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for
prostate cancer Their recommendation is based on
evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of
death from prostate cancer Prostate cancer often
develops very slowly and does not cause problems
while the cancer treatment can have severe side
effects The PCA3 test is considered to be more
accurate but screening may still result in men who
would not have been harmed by the cancer itself
suffering side effects from treatment What do you
think Should all healthy men be screened for
prostate cancer using the PCA3 or PSA test Should
people in general be screened to find out if they have
a genetic risk for cancer or other diseases
