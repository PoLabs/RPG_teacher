16  GENE EXPRESSION
Figure 161 The genetic content of each somatic cell in an organism is the same but not all genes are expressed in
every cell The control of which genes are expressed dictates whether a cell is for example a an eye cell or b a liver
cell It is the differential gene expression patterns that arise in different cells that give rise to c a complete organism

Introduction
Each somatic cell in the body generally contains the same DNA A few exceptions include red blood cells which
contain no DNA in their mature state and some immune system cells that rearrange their DNA while producing
antibodies In general however the genes that determine whether you have green eyes brown hair and how
fast you metabolize food are the same in the cells in your eyes and your liver even though these organs function
quite differently If each cell has the same DNA how is it that cells or organs are different Why do cells in the
eye differ so dramatically from cells in the liver
Whereas each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence each cell does not turn on or express the
same set of genes Each cell type needs a different set of proteins to perform its function Therefore only a
small subset of proteins is expressed in a cell For the proteins to be expressed the DNA must be transcribed
into RNA and the RNA must be translated into protein In a given cell type not all genes encoded in the DNA
are transcribed into RNA or translated into protein because specific cells in our body have specific functions
Specialized proteins that make up the eye iris lens and cornea are only expressed in the eye whereas the
specialized proteins in the heart pacemaker cells heart muscle and valves are only expressed in the heart
At any given time only a subset of all of the genes encoded by our DNA are expressed and translated into
proteins The expression of specific genes is a highly regulated process with many levels and stages of control
This complexity ensures the proper expression in the proper cell at the proper time
