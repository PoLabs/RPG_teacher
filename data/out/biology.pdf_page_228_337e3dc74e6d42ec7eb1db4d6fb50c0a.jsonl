glucose1phosphate G1P and converted into glucose6phosphate G6P in both muscle and liver cells
and this product enters the glycolytic pathway
Sucrose is a disaccharide with a molecule of glucose and a molecule of fructose bonded together with a
glycosidic linkage Fructose is one of the three dietary monosaccharides along with glucose and galactose
part of the milk sugar dissacharide lactose which are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion
The catabolism of both fructose and galactose produces the same number of ATP molecules as glucose
Connections of Proteins to Glucose Metabolism
Proteins are hydrolyzed by a variety of enzymes in cells Most of the time the amino acids are recycled into the
synthesis of new proteins If there are excess amino acids however or if the body is in a state of starvation
some amino acids will be shunted into the pathways of glucose catabolism Figure 716 It is very important to
note that each amino acid must have its amino group removed prior to entry into these pathways The amino
group is converted into ammonia In mammals the liver synthesizes urea from two ammonia molecules and
a carbon dioxide molecule Thus urea is the principal waste product in mammals produced from the nitrogen
originating in amino acids and it leaves the body in urine It should be noted that amino acids can be synthesized
from the intermediates and reactants in the cellular respiration cycle
Figure 716 The carbon skeletons of certain amino acids indicated in boxes derived from proteins can feed into the
citric acid cycle credit modification of work by Mikael Hggstrm
Connections of Lipid and Glucose Metabolisms
The lipids connected to the glucose pathway include cholesterol and triglycerides Cholesterol is a lipid that
contributes to cell membrane flexibility and is a precursor of steroid hormones The synthesis of cholesterol starts
with acetyl groups and proceeds in only one direction The process cannot be reversed
Triglyceridesmade from the bonding of glycerol and three fatty acidsare a form of longterm energy
storage in animals Animals can make most of the fatty acids they need Triglycerides can be both made
and broken down through parts of the glucose catabolism pathways Glycerol can be phosphorylated to
glycerol3phosphate which continues through glycolysis Fatty acids are catabolized in a process called beta
oxidation which takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria and converts their fatty acid chains into twocarbon
units of acetyl groups The acetyl groups are picked up by CoA to form acetyl CoA that proceeds into the citric
acid cycle
