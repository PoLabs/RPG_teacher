Figure 2416 Fairy ring The fruiting bodies of a basidiomycete form a ring in a meadow commonly called fairy ring
The bestknown fairy ring fungus has the scientific name Marasmius oreades The body of this fungus its mycelium is
underground and grows outward in a circle As it grows the mycelium depletes the soil of nitrogen causing the mycelia
to grow away from the center and leading to the fairy ring of fruiting bodies where there is adequate soil nitrogen

The lifecycle of basidiomycetes includes alternation of generations Figure 2417 Most fungi are haploid
through most of their life cycles but the basidiomycetes produce both haploid and dikaryotic mycelia with
the dikaryotic phase being dominant Note The dikaryotic phase is technically not diploid since the nuclei
remain unfused until shortly before spore production In the basidiomycetes sexual spores are more common
than asexual spores The sexual spores form in the clubshaped basidium and are called basidiospores In
the basidium nuclei of two different mating strains fuse karyogamy giving rise to a diploid zygote that then
undergoes meiosis The haploid nuclei migrate into four different chambers appended to the basidium and then
become basidiospores
Each basidiospore germinates and generates monokaryotic haploid hyphae The mycelium that results is called
a primary mycelium Mycelia of different mating strains can combine and produce a secondary mycelium that
contains haploid nuclei of two different mating strains This is the dominant dikaryotic stage of the basidiomycete
life cycle Thus each cell in this mycelium has two haploid nuclei which will not fuse until formation of the
basidium Eventually the secondary mycelium generates a basidiocarp a fruiting body that protrudes from the
groundthis is what we think of as a mushroom The basidiocarp bears the developing basidia on the gills under
its cap
