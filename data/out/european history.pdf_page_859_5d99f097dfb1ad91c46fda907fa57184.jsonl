Wagner also had an important influence on the French composer Claude 
Debussy 18621918 who first embraced and later rejected the work of the 
German master Debussy is often seen as the first impressionist composer a 
label he himself vigorously rejected Like in fine art impressionism in music 
focuses on the subjective perspective of the artist conveying moods and 
evoking feelings Impressionist composers rejected tradition emphasising 
static harmony instrumental timbres that created a shimmering interplay of 
colours and unusual chord combinations With this they laid the ground for 
developments in abstraction and atonality in the twentieth century
Conclusion
The nineteenth century gave rise to the idea of the avantgardea small 
group of innovators challenging societys norms and conventions and pushing 
artistic moral and political boundaries In many ways the avantgarde artists 
and thinkers of the time reacted to the profound changes they experienced 
from the growth of the industrial working class to the spread of photography 
and the advent of the railroad Science and new technologies of observation 
and reproduction inspired them to focus on new perspectives to express the 
sensory totality of this modern world While the avantgarde often seemed to 
abandon sociopolitical engagement for formal innovation and art for arts 
sake the continuous revolution of isms mirrored the waves of political and 
social transformation and the contemporary feeling of change as a sign of the 
times
