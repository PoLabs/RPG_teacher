How LightDependent Reactions Work
The overall function of lightdependent reactions is to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form
of NADPH and ATP This chemical energy supports the lightindependent reactions and fuels the assembly of
sugar molecules The lightdependent reactions are depicted in Figure 815 Protein complexes and pigment
molecules work together to produce NADPH and ATP The numbering of the photosystems is derived from the
order in which they were discovered not in the order of the transfer of electrons
Figure 815 A photosystem consists of 1 a lightharvesting complex and 2 a reaction center Pigments in the light
harvesting complex pass light energy to two special chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction center The light excites
an electron from the chlorophyll a pair which passes to the primary electron acceptor The excited electron must then
be replaced In a photosystem II the electron comes from the splitting of water which releases oxygen as a waste
product In b photosystem I the electron comes from the chloroplast electron transport chain discussed below
The actual step that converts light energy into chemical energy takes place in a multiprotein complex called a
photosystem two types of which are found embedded in the thylakoid membrane photosystem II PSII and
photosystem I PSI Figure 816 The two complexes differ on the basis of what they oxidize that is the
source of the lowenergy electron supply and what they reduce the place to which they deliver their energized
electrons
Both photosystems have the same basic structure a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll
molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place Each photosystem is
serviced by the lightharvesting complex which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center it consists
of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300 to 400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other
pigments like carotenoids The absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or packet of light by any of
the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state In short the light energy has now been captured
