forms in blue used anaerobic metabolism to obtain energy from their surroundings
Evolution of Metabolic Pathways
There is more to the complexity of metabolism than understanding the metabolic pathways alone Metabolic
complexity varies from organism to organism Photosynthesis is the primary pathway in which
photosynthetic organisms like plants planktonic algae perform the majority of global synthesis harvest
the suns energy and convert it into carbohydrates The byproduct of photosynthesis is oxygen which
some cells require to carry out cellular respiration During cellular respiration oxygen aids in the catabolic
breakdown of carbon compounds like carbohydrates Among the products are CO2 and ATP In addition
some eukaryotes perform catabolic processes without oxygen fermentation that is they perform or use
anaerobic metabolism
Organisms probably evolved anaerobic metabolism to survive living organisms came into existence about
38 billion years ago when the atmosphere lacked oxygen Despite the differences between organisms
and the complexity of metabolism researchers have found that all branches of life share some of the
same metabolic pathways suggesting that all organisms evolved from the same ancient common ancestor
Figure 64 Evidence indicates that over time the pathways diverged adding specialized enzymes to
allow organisms to better adapt to their environment thus increasing their chance to survive However the
underlying principle remains that all organisms must harvest energy from their environment and convert it
to ATP to carry out cellular functions
Anabolic and Catabolic Pathways
Anabolic pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones Synthesizing
sugar from CO2 is one example Other examples are synthesizing large proteins from amino acid building blocks
and synthesizing new DNA strands from nucleic acid building blocks These biosynthetic processes are critical
to the cells life take place constantly and demand energy that ATP and other highenergy molecules like NADH
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and NADPH provide Figure 65
ATP is an important molecule for cells to have in sufficient supply at all times The breakdown of sugars illustrates
how a single glucose molecule can store enough energy to make a great deal of ATP 36 to 38 molecules This is
a catabolic pathway Catabolic pathways involve degrading or breaking down complex molecules into simpler
ones Molecular energy stored in complex molecule bonds release in catabolic pathways and harvest in such
a way that it can produce ATP Other energystoring molecules such as fats also break down through similar
catabolic reactions to release energy and make ATP Figure 65
It is important to know that metabolic pathway chemical reactions do not take place spontaneously A protein
called an enzyme facilitates or catalyzes each reaction step Enzymes are important for catalyzing all types of
biological reactionsthose that require energy as well as those that release energy
