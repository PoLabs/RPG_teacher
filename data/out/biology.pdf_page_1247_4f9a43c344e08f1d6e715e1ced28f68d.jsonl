Figure 3915 This graph shows data from Boyles original 1662 experiment which shows that pressure and volume
are inversely related No units are given as Boyle used arbitrary units in his experiments
There is always a slightly negative pressure within the thoracic cavity which aids in keeping the airways
of the lungs open During inhalation volume increases as a result of contraction of the diaphragm and
pressure decreases according to Boyles Law This decrease of pressure in the thoracic cavity relative to the
environment makes the cavity less than the atmosphere Figure 3916a Because of this drop in pressure air
rushes into the respiratory passages To increase the volume of the lungs the chest wall expands This results
from the contraction of the intercostal muscles the muscles that are connected to the rib cage Lung volume
expands because the diaphragm contracts and the intercostal muscles contract thus expanding the thoracic
cavity This increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity lowers pressure compared to the atmosphere so air
rushes into the lungs thus increasing its volume The resulting increase in volume is largely attributed to an
increase in alveolar space because the bronchioles and bronchi are stiff structures that do not change in size

The chest wall expands out and away from the lungs The lungs are elastic therefore when air fills the lungs the
elastic recoil within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs These outward
and inward forces compete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath Upon exhalation the lungs recoil
to force the air out of the lungs and the intercostal muscles relax returning the chest wall back to its original
position Figure 3916b The diaphragm also relaxes and moves higher into the thoracic cavity This increases
the pressure within the thoracic cavity relative to the environment and air rushes out of the lungs The movement
of air out of the lungs is a passive event No muscles are contracting to expel the air
Each lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac The layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces
is called the visceral pleura A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax Figure 3917
The space between these layers the intrapleural space contains a small amount of fluid that protects the
