441  The Scope of Ecology
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Define ecology and the four basic levels of ecological research

Describe examples of the ways in which ecology requires the integration of different scientific disciplines

Distinguish between abiotic and biotic components of the environment

Recognize the relationship between abiotic and biotic components of the environment
Ecology is the study of the interactions of living organisms with their environment One core goal of ecology is
to understand the distribution and abundance of living things in the physical environment Attainment of this goal
requires the integration of scientific disciplines inside and outside of biology such as mathematics statistics
biochemistry molecular biology physiology evolution biodiversity geology and climatology
Climate change can alter where organisms live which can sometimes directly affect human health Watch
the PBS video Feeling the Effects of Climate Change httpopenstaxcollegeorglclimate_health in
which researchers discover a pathogenic organism living far outside of its normal range
Levels of Ecological Study
When a discipline such as biology is studied it is often helpful to subdivide it into smaller related areas For
instance cell biologists interested in cell signaling need to understand the chemistry of the signal molecules
which are usually proteins as well as the result of cell signaling Ecologists interested in the factors that
influence the survival of an endangered species might use mathematical models to predict how current
conservation efforts affect endangered organisms
To produce a sound set of management options a conservation biologist needs to collect accurate data
including current population size factors affecting reproduction like physiology and behavior habitat
requirements such as plants and soils and potential human influences on the endangered population and its
habitat which might be derived through studies in sociology and urban ecology Within the discipline of ecology
researchers work at four general levels which sometimes overlap These levels are organism population
community and ecosystem Figure 442
