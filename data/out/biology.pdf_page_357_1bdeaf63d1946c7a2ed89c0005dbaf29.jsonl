Independent Assortment
Mendels law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the
sorting of alleles into gametes and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to
occur The independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross a cross between two true
breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics Consider the characteristics of seed color
and seed texture for two pea plants one that has green wrinkled seeds yyrr and another that has yellow
round seeds YYRR Because each parent is homozygous the law of segregation indicates that the gametes
for the greenwrinkled plant all are yr and the gametes for the yellowround plant are all YR Therefore the F1
generation of offspring all are YyRr Figure 1216
Figure 1216 This dihybrid cross of pea plants involves the genes for seed color and texture
In pea plants purple flowers P are dominant to white flowers p and yellow peas Y are dominant to
green peas y What are the possible genotypes and phenotypes for a cross between PpYY and ppYy pea
plants How many squares do you need to do a Punnett square analysis of this cross
For the F2 generation the law of segregation requires that each gamete receive either an R allele or an r
allele along with either a Y allele or a y allele The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into
which an r allele sorted would be equally likely to contain either a Y allele or a y allele Thus there are four
equally likely gametes that can be formed when the YyRr heterozygote is selfcrossed as follows YR Yr yR
and yr Arranging these gametes along the top and left of a 4  4 Punnett square Figure 1216 gives us 16
equally likely genotypic combinations From these genotypes we infer a phenotypic ratio of 9 roundyellow3

assuming we performed the crosses with a large enough sample size
Because of independent assortment and dominance the 9331 dihybrid phenotypic ratio can be collapsed into
two 31 ratios characteristic of any monohybrid cross that follows a dominant and recessive pattern Ignoring
seed color and considering only seed texture in the above dihybrid cross we would expect that three quarters
of the F2 generation offspring would be round and one quarter would be wrinkled Similarly isolating only seed
color we would assume that three quarters of the F2 offspring would be yellow and one quarter would be green
The sorting of alleles for texture and color are independent events so we can apply the product rule Therefore
