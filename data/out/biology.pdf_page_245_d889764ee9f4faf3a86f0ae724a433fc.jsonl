Figure 812 The colors of visible light do not carry the same amount of energy Violet has the shortest wavelength and
therefore carries the most energy whereas red has the longest wavelength and carries the least amount of energy

Understanding Pigments
Different kinds of pigments exist and each absorbs only specific wavelengths colors of visible light Pigments
reflect or transmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb making them appear a mixture of the reflected or
transmitted light colors
Chlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic pigments found in plants and algae
each class has multiple types of pigment molecules There are five major chlorophylls a b c and d and a related
molecule found in prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher
plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion
With dozens of different forms carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments The carotenoids found in
fruitsuch as the red of tomato lycopene the yellow of corn seeds zeaxanthin or the orange of an orange
peel caroteneare used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers In photosynthesis carotenoids
function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy When a
leaf is exposed to full sun the lightdependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy
if that energy is not handled properly it can do significant damage Therefore many carotenoids reside in the
thylakoid membrane absorb excess energy and safely dissipate that energy as heat
Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light This
is termed the absorption spectrum The graph in Figure 813 shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll
a chlorophyll b and a type of carotenoid pigment called carotene which absorbs blue and green light
Notice how each pigment has a distinct set of peaks and troughs revealing a highly specific pattern of
absorption Chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum blue and red but not
green Because green is reflected or transmitted chlorophyll appears green Carotenoids absorb in the short
wavelength blue region and reflect the longer yellow red and orange wavelengths
