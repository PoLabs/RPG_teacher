cruel wickedness and he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of Dale and
its merry bells and the burned banks of the bright River Running The moon was
shining in a broad silver crescent He held up the map and the white light shone
through it What is this he said There are moonletters here beside the plain
runes which say five feet high the door and three may walk abreast
What are moonletters asked the hobbit full of excitement He loved
maps as I have told you before and he also liked runes and letters and cunning
handwriting though when he wrote himself it was a bit thin and spidery
Moonletters are runeletters but you cannot see them said Elrond not
when you look straight at them They can only be seen when the moon shines
behind them and what is more with the more cunning sort it must be a moon of

That remains to be seen said Gandalf Is there any more writing
None to be seen by this moon said Elrond and he gave the map back to
Thorin and then they went down to the water to see the elves dance and sing
