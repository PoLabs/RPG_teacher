Some of these new technologies like photography became mass media 
virtually overnight Others spread more slowly the radio for example 
took decades to develop into a mass medium after its invention in the late
nineteenth century The fact that certain technologies did not rapidly acquire 
a mass public did not make them irrelevant even if they may have been in 
limited use the adoption of the telegraph in 1830 and the telephone in 1876 
fundamentally reshaped perceptions of distance speed and communication 
The Newspaper Civilisation of Nineteenthcentury 
Europe
The mass medium which impacted European societies the mostpartly because 
it was already an established form of communication but more importantly 
because of its practicality and costeffectivenesswas the newspaper Its 
rapidly expanding readership which grew over time across the continent to 
an audience of millions comprehensively shaped the development of public 
debates and national identities This impact was so profound that according 
to some observers the widening distribution and significance of newspapers 
gave rise to a new cultural regime 
Symbolised by the newspaper and in particular the daily newspaper

of books posters flyers magazines and newspapers Before the nineteenth 
century reading had primarily been an activity for the elite geared towards 
religion or the acquisition of knowledge But in the nineteenth century reading 
became a popular activity increasingly oriented towards pleasure news and 
opinion Newspapers became the matrix of minds and the main shaper of 
opinions As the German philosopher Georg W F Hegel 17701831 wrote

significantly decreased in the nineteenth century in part because of increasing 
economies of scale At the British newspaper The Times of London for example 
the introduction of the Koenig steam press in 1815 accelerated its production 
to 1000 sheets per hour and the Applegarth printing press acquired in 1827 
increased it to 4000 per hour This allowed The Times to be printed later in the 
day and therefore to offer readers more uptodate news than the competition 
At the same time print runs increased significantly the circulation of The Times 
went from 5000 copies in 1815 to 40000 in 1851 
All facets of newspaper production were similarly impacted by 
modernisation from paper the introduction of cellulose in 1938 to printing
