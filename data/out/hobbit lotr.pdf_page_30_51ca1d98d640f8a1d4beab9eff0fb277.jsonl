If you had dusted the mantelpiece you would have found this just under the
clock said Gandalf handing Bilbo a note written of course on his own note
paper
This is what he read
Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting For your hospitality our
sincerest thanks and for your offer of professional assistance our grateful

That leaves you just ten minutes You will have to run said Gandalf
But said Bilbo
No time for it said the wizard
But said Bilbo again
No time for that either Off you go
To the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he found himself
outside without a hat a walkingstick or any money or anything that he usually
took when he went out leaving his second breakfast halffinished and quite
unwashedup pushing his keys into Gandalfs hands and running as fast as his
furry feet could carry him down the lane past the great Mill across The Water
and then on for a mile or more
Very puffed he was when he got to Bywater just on the stroke of eleven and
found he had come without a pockethandkerchief
Bravo said Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out for him
Just then all the others came round the corner of the road from the village
They were on ponies and each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages
packages parcels and paraphernalia There was a very small pony apparently
