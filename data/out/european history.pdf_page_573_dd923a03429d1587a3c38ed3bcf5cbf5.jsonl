44 UNDERSTANDING AND CONTROLLING THE ENVIRONMENT

both man and nature The famous motto of Russian agricultural scientist 
Ivan V Michurin 18551935 captured these feelings clearly We cannot 
expect favours from nature it is our job to take them from her Following 
such a motto the Soviet Union attempted a bold largescale environmental 
transformation scheme known as Stalins Plan for the Transformation of 
Nature When the USSR faced extreme drought under Stalin in the late 1940s 
experts developed a plan to redirect water streams from the southern USSR in 
order to change local climates and soils elsewhere and also to enable the growth 
of forests and the agricultural use of the countrys arid steppes Gradually 
abandoned after Stalins death in 1953 the project achieved limited success in 
increasing the production of rice and cotton but significantly contributed to 
ecological catastrophes like the desertification of the Aral Sea which has since 
shrunk to less than ten percent of its original size Paradoxically it appears 
that Soviet planners tried to establish a new sustainable ecological balance 
while simultaneously worsening the same landscape as a result of political 
and economic pressures pressures which demonstrated the limits of scientific 
knowledge and capabilities The Soviet scheme represents an extreme case 
but in principle the attitudes of other European governmentsincluding 
capitalist onesdid not differ greatly especially in the period since the Great 
Depression of the 1930s
However science simultaneously helped to undermine faith in the 
omnipotence of human reason From the 1950s onward voices emphasising 
a cautious approach to the environment moved slowly from dissent to the 
mainstream Leading thinkers of ecological science such as the German Ernst 
Haeckel 18341919 hinted early on at the mutual interdependence of various 
elements of nature organisms and their surroundings and the immense 
complexity of the natural world The Russian Vladimir Vernadsky 1863
1945 and the Englishman Arthur Tansley 18711955 further developed the 
argument in the interwar period In effect postwar economic reconstruction 
brought not only massive pressure on the environment but also the emergence 
of ecology as a universally accepted field of science The harmful effects of 
industrial waste on ecosystems suddenly became widely discussed in terms of 
pollution As poisoned air and toxic water easily crossed national borders it 
became a matter at the international level
Environmental Policy and International Diplomacy
Neither environmental problems nor environmentalist traditions were unique 
to the twentieth century One approach to environmentalism which emerged 
in the nineteenth century and whose influence continued into the twentieth 
came from nature protection societies These societies were comprised of
