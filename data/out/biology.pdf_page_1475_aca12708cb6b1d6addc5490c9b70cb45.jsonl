Threespined Stickleback
It is well established by the theory of natural selection that changes in the environment play a major role in
the evolution of species within an ecosystem However little is known about how the evolution of species
within an ecosystem can alter the ecosystem environment In 2009 Dr Luke Harmon from the University of
Idaho published a paper that for the first time showed that the evolution of organisms into subspecies can
have direct effects on their ecosystem environment

The threespined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus is a freshwater fish that evolved from a saltwater fish
to live in freshwater lakes about 10000 years ago which is considered a recent development in evolutionary
time Figure 467 Over the last 10000 years these freshwater fish then became isolated from each other
in different lakes Depending on which lake population was studied findings showed that these sticklebacks
then either remained as one species or evolved into two species The divergence of species was made
possible by their use of different areas of the pond for feeding called micro niches
Dr Harmon and his team created artificial pond microcosms in 250gallon tanks and added muck from
freshwater ponds as a source of zooplankton and other invertebrates to sustain the fish In different
experimental tanks they introduced one species of stickleback from either a singlespecies or double
species lake
Over time the team observed that some of the tanks bloomed with algae while others did not This puzzled
the scientists and they decided to measure the waters dissolved organic carbon DOC which consists of
mostly large molecules of decaying organic matter that give pondwater its slightly brownish color It turned
out that the water from the tanks with twospecies fish contained larger particles of DOC and hence darker
water than water with singlespecies fish This increase in DOC blocked the sunlight and prevented algal
blooming Conversely the water from the singlespecies tank contained smaller DOC particles allowing
more sunlight penetration to fuel the algal blooms
This change in the environment which is due to the different feeding habits of the stickleback species in
each lake type probably has a great impact on the survival of other species in these ecosystems especially
other photosynthetic organisms Thus the study shows that at least in these ecosystems the environment
and the evolution of populations have reciprocal effects that may now be factored into simulation models

Modeling
The study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment disturbances or
by internal forces is called ecosystem dynamics Ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research
