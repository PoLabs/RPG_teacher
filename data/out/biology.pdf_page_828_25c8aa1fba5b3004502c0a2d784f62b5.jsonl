Phylum Annelida
Phylum Annelida comprises the true segmented worms These animals are found in marine terrestrial and
freshwater habitats but the presence of water or humidity is a critical factor for their survival in terrestrial
habitats The annelids are often called segmented worms due to their key characteristic of metamerism or
true segmentation Approximately 16500 species have been described in phylum Annelida which includes
polychaete worms marine annelids with multiple appendages and oligochaetes earthworms and leeches
Some animals in this phylum show parasitic and commensal symbioses with other species in their habitat
Morphology
Annelids display bilateral symmetry and are wormlike in overall morphology The name of the phylum is derived
from the Latin word annullus which means a small ring an apt description of the ringlike segmentation of
the body Annelids have a body plan with metameric segmentation in which several internal and external
morphological features are repeated in each body segment Metamerism allows animals to become bigger by
adding compartments while making their movement more efficient The overall body can be divided into head
body and pygidium or tail During development the segments behind the head arise sequentially from a growth
region anterior to the pygidium a pattern called teloblastic growth In the Oligochaetes the clitellum is a
reproductive structure that generates mucus to aid sperm transfer and also produces a cocoon within which
fertilization occurs it appears as a permanent fused band located on the anterior third of the animal Figure

Anatomy
The epidermis is protected by a collagenous external cuticle which is much thinner than the cuticle found in
