The German philosopher Karl Marx 18181883 in contrast to Mill was 
quick to add that customs and values are actually produced by the economic 
relations in the same way as wages and thus the principles of income 
and wealth distribution are fully dependent on the entire working of the 
economic system In his critique of capitalism Marx argued that one of its 
systemic features is exploitation A worker is only paid a subsistence wage 
if he is employed at all which does not correlate to the value of what he 
produces but to the value of his skills on the market The difference between the 
market price of the product and paid wages Marx argued is actually workers 
unpaid wage and constitutes a major part of the profit of a capitalist In their 
writings Marx and his colleague Engels addressed the existing situation of the 
large numbers of the emerging English working classes during the industrial 
revolution Building upon vast statistical evidence and contemporary surveys 
and reports on incomes living standards or health of the industrial labourers 
they argued that workers experienced dire social and economic conditions 
and most were even worse off than before industrialisation
In response to Marxism proponents of classical economics argued that 
inequality is in itself not a negative thing By the end of the nineteenth century 
Italian political scientist and economist Vilfredo Pareto 18481923 studied 
the distribution of wealth in Italian society Finding out that approximately 
twenty percent of the population controlled eighty percent of national wealth 
he considered the examples of other European countries Interestingly the 
results roughly corresponded to the Italian case The socalled Pareto principle 
became a generally accepted distribution pattern according to which the 
extremely rich strata of a population within a given economy control most 
of the nations wealth Pareto who harboured strong antisocialist sentiments 
and is usually classified as one of the leading figures of the neoclassical 
revolution in economic thought of the late nineteenth century argued that 
some level of wealth inequality within a society is both natural independent 
of the particular social and political system and even productive 
Towards the end of the nineteenth century levels of income inequality 
started to significantly decline Economic historians studying the rise and 
decline in inequality echoing Paretos explanation stress the role of structural 
variables such as demographic change technological change and income effects 
in explaining this process Variables such as these initially boost inequality 
and gradually tend towards a new equilibrium When explaining inequality 
however it would be unwise to ignore the role of public policies often 
framed as under the influence of economic experts As the English economist 
Arnold Toynbee 18521883 rightly observed in his Lectures on the Industrial 
Revolution 1884 industrialisation in Britain was accompanied by the process 
of democratisation characterised by extension of parliamentary suffrage and
