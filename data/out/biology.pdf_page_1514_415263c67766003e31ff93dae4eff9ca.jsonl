of natural landscapes that suggests the hypothesis may hold some truth In addition there is a moral argument
that humans have a responsibility to inflict as little harm as possible on other species
473  Threats to Biodiversity
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify significant threats to biodiversity

Explain the effects of habitat loss the introduction of exotic species and hunting on biodiversity

Identify the early and predicted effects of climate change on biodiversity
The core threat to biodiversity on the planet and therefore a threat to human welfare is the combination of
human population growth and resource exploitation The human population requires resources to survive and
grow and those resources are being removed unsustainably from the environment The three greatest proximate
threats to biodiversity are habitat loss overharvesting and the introduction of exotic species The first two of
these are a direct result of human population growth and resource use The third results from increased mobility
and trade A fourth major cause of extinction anthropogenic climate change has not yet had a large impact but
it is predicted to become significant during this century Global climate change is also a consequence of human
population needs for energy and the use of fossil fuels to meet those needs Figure 4710 Environmental
issues such as toxic pollution have specific targeted effects on species but they are not generally seen as
threats at the magnitude of the others
Figure 4710 Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels fluctuate in a cyclical manner However the burning of fossil fuels in
recent history has caused a dramatic increase in the levels of carbon dioxide in the Earths atmosphere which have
now reached levels never before seen in human history Scientists predict that the addition of this greenhouse gas to
the atmosphere is resulting in climate change that will significantly impact biodiversity in the coming century
Habitat Loss
Humans rely on technology to modify their environment and replace certain functions that were once performed
by the natural ecosystem Other species cannot do this Elimination of their ecosystemwhether it is a forest
a desert a grassland a freshwater estuarine or a marine environmentwill kill the individuals belonging to
the species The species will become extinct if we remove the entire habitat within the range of a species
Human destruction of habitats accelerated in the latter half of the twentieth century Consider the exceptional
biodiversity of Sumatra it is home to one species of orangutan a species of critically endangered elephant and
the Sumatran tiger but half of Sumatras forest is now gone The neighboring island of Borneo home to the other
species of orangutan has lost a similar area of forest Forest loss continues in protected areas of Borneo All
