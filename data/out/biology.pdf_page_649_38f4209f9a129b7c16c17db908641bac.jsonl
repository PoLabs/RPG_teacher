cysts that are a protective resting stage Depending on habitat of the species the cysts may be particularly
resistant to temperature extremes desiccation or low pH This strategy allows certain protists to wait out
stressors until their environment becomes more favorable for survival or until they are carried such as by wind
water or transport on a larger organism to a different environment because cysts exhibit virtually no cellular
metabolism
Protist life cycles range from simple to extremely elaborate Certain parasitic protists have complicated life cycles
and must infect different host species at different developmental stages to complete their life cycle Some protists
are unicellular in the haploid form and multicellular in the diploid form a strategy employed by animals Other
protists have multicellular stages in both haploid and diploid forms a strategy called alternation of generations
analogous to that used by plants
Habitats
Nearly all protists exist in some type of aquatic environment including freshwater and marine environments
damp soil and even snow Several protist species are parasites that infect animals or plants A few protist
species live on dead organisms or their wastes and contribute to their decay
233  Groups of Protists
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe representative protist organisms from each of the six presently recognized supergroups of
eukaryotes

Identify the evolutionary relationships of plants animals and fungi within the six presently recognized
supergroups of eukaryotes

Identify defining features of protists in each of the six supergroups of eukaryotes
In the span of several decades the Kingdom Protista has been disassembled because sequence analyses
have revealed new genetic and therefore evolutionary relationships among these eukaryotes Moreover
protists that exhibit similar morphological features may have evolved analogous structures because of similar
selective pressuresrather than because of recent common ancestry This phenomenon called convergent
evolution is one reason why protist classification is so challenging The emerging classification scheme groups
the entire domain Eukarya into six supergroups that contain all of the protists as well as animals plants
and fungi that evolved from a common ancestor Figure 239 Each of the supergroups is believed to be
monophyletic meaning that all organisms within each supergroup are believed to have evolved from a single
common ancestor and thus all members are most closely related to each other than to organisms outside
that group There is still evidence lacking for the monophyly of some groups Each supergroup can be viewed
as representing one of many variants on eukaryotic cell structure In each group one or more of the defining
characters of the eukaryotic cellthe nucleus the cytoskeleton and the endosymbiotic organellesmay have
diverged from the typical pattern
