Figure 108 During cytokinesis in animal cells a ring of actin filaments forms at the metaphase plate The ring
contracts forming a cleavage furrow which divides the cell in two In plant cells Golgi vesicles coalesce at the former
metaphase plate forming a phragmoplast A cell plate formed by the fusion of the vesicles of the phragmoplast grows
from the center toward the cell walls and the membranes of the vesicles fuse to form a plasma membrane that divides
the cell in two
G0 Phase
Not all cells adhere to the classic cellcycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters
the preparatory phases of interphase closely followed by the mitotic phase and cytokinesis Cells in G0 phase
are not actively preparing to divide The cell is in a quiescent inactive stage that occurs when cells exit the
cell cycle Some cells enter G0 temporarily due to environmental conditions such as availability of nutrients or
stimulation by growth factors The cell will remain in this phase until conditions improve or until an external signal
triggers the onset of G1 Other cells that never or rarely divide such as mature cardiac muscle and nerve cells
remain in G0 permanently
Which of the following is the correct order of events in mitosis
a
Sister chromatids line up at the metaphase plate The kinetochore becomes attached to the mitotic
spindle The nucleus reforms and the cell divides Cohesin proteins break down and the sister
chromatids separate
b
The kinetochore becomes attached to the mitotic spindle Cohesin proteins break down and the sister
chromatids separate Sister chromatids line up at the metaphase plate The nucleus reforms and the
cell divides
c
The kinetochore becomes attached to the cohesin proteins Sister chromatids line up at the metaphase
plate The kinetochore breaks down and the sister chromatids separate The nucleus reforms and the
cell divides
d
The kinetochore becomes attached to the mitotic spindle Sister chromatids line up at the metaphase
plate Cohesin proteins break down and the sister chromatids separate The nucleus reforms and the
cell divides
