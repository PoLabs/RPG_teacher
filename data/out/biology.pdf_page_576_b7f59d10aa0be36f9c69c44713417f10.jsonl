Baltimore Classification
The most commonly and currently used system of virus classification was first developed by Nobel Prizewinning
biologist David Baltimore in the early 1970s In addition to the differences in morphology and genetics mentioned
above the Baltimore classification scheme groups viruses according to how the mRNA is produced during the
replicative cycle of the virus
Group I viruses contain doublestranded DNA dsDNA as their genome Their mRNA is produced by
transcription in much the same way as with cellular DNA using the enzymes of the host cell
Group II viruses have singlestranded DNA ssDNA as their genome They convert their singlestranded
genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur
Group III viruses use dsRNA as their genome The strands separate and one of them is used as a template for
the generation of mRNA using the RNAdependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus
Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity which means that the genomic RNA can
serve directly as mRNA Intermediates of dsRNA called replicative intermediates are made in the process of
copying the genomic RNA Multiple fulllength RNA strands of negative polarity complementary to the positive
stranded genomic RNA are formed from these intermediates which may then serve as templates for the
production of RNA with positive polarity including both fulllength genomic RNA and shorter viral mRNAs
Group V viruses contain ssRNA genomes with a negative polarity meaning that their sequence is
complementary to the mRNA As with Group IV viruses dsRNA intermediates are used to make copies of the
genome and produce mRNA In this case the negativestranded genome can be converted directly to mRNA
Additionally fulllength positive RNA strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative
stranded genome
Group VI viruses have diploid two copies ssRNA genomes that must be converted using the enzyme reverse
transcriptase to dsDNA the dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the
host genome Then mRNA can be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host
genome
Group VII viruses have partial dsDNA genomes and make ssRNA intermediates that act as mRNA but are also
