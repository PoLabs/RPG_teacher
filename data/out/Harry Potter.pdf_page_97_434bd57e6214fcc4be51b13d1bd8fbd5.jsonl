was looking at the black inside of the hat He waited
Hmm said a small voice in his ear Difficult Very difficult Plenty
of courage I see Not a bad mind either Theres talent A my goodness
yes  and a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interesting
So where shall I put you
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought Not Slytherin not
Slytherin
Not Slytherin eh said the small voice Are you sure You could be
great you know its all here in your head and Slytherin will help you
on the way to greatness no doubt about that  no Well if youre sure
 better be GRYFFINDOR
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall He took off
the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table He was so
relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin he hardly noticed
that he was getting the loudest cheer yet Percy the Prefect got up and
shook his hand vigorously while the Weasley twins yelled We got
Potter We got Potter Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff
hed seen earlier The ghost patted his arm giving Harry the sudden
horrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of icecold water
He could see the High Table properly now At the end nearest him sat
Hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up Harry grinned
back And there in the center of the High Table in a large gold chair
sat Albus Dumbledore Harry recognized him at once from the card hed
gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train Dumbledores silver hair
was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the
ghosts Harry spotted Professor Quirtell too the nervous young man
from the Leaky Cauldron He was looking very peculiar in a large purple
turban
And now there were only three people left to be sorted Thomas Dean
a Black boy even taller than Ron joined Harry at the Gryffindor table
Turpin Lisa became a Ravenclaw and then it was Rons turn He was
pale green by now Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a
second later the hat had shouted GRYFFINDOR
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next
to him
