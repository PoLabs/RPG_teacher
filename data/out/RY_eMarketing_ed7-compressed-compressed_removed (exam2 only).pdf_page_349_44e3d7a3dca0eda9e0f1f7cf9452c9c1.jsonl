ANALYSING
The contents of this chapter and textbook as a whole will remain words on a page until you 
practice what you have learned and put these teachings into action In this section we unpack 
what it is going to take from a resource perspective to get ready for the future of advertising 
Creativity alone is no longer the only requirement for brands and agencies The influence of 
technology on the advertising industry and the transformation of the digital marketing world 
requires more than the manual job bags and methods that were standard practice two decades 
ago Everyone who has an interest in brand marketing and advertising must upgrade their 
processes With the abundance of tools automation and bots becoming part of marketing 
departments agencies and people who dont transform towards the future risk being left 
behind wasting time on tasks that slow down decision making 
Advertising an endtoend view 
Advertising is not only about making an advert anymore It entails the entire process from 
advert creation to measuring and analytics particularly in digital advertising Realtime 
reporting of a published advert can and should link back to the creative execution although 
not everyone is doing it The intelligence that a brand can gain from these insights will be 
beneficial in the long term
In essence agencies should start looking into the endtoend process of advertising in order 
to charge for value Using automation can reduce backoffice costs which will also reveal a 
few valuable factors
	
Retainers will increase because the value created by advertising will become more apparent 
with better reporting and sales results
	
Agency structures may likely change requiring fewer client service staff and more strategy 
and creative staff
	
Agency margins will improve because less wastage means improved efficiency while 
transparency will make it easier for agencies and clients to work together identify mistakes 
and rectify them
The role of the CMO 
PostCOVID the role of the Chief Marketing Officer CMO should evolve beyond creating 
leads Instead the focus should shift to actively finding and making deals and revenue happen 
The role will entail more than driving audience engagement and should include driving the 
sales process as a whole 
Marketing leaders are unique to the organisation because beyond marketing operations they 
are responsible for the gotomarket of the business The role of marketing in increasing and 
securing market share has become more direct immediate and urgent than ever
