map a linear representation of gene order and relative distance on a chromosome Figure 134
Figure 134 This genetic map orders Drosophila genes on the basis of recombination frequency
Which of the following statements is true
a
Recombination of the body color and redcinnabar eye alleles will occur more frequently than
recombination of the alleles for wing length and aristae length
b
Recombination of the body color and aristae length alleles will occur more frequently than
recombination of redbrown eye alleles and the aristae length alleles
c
Recombination of the grayblack body color and longshort aristae alleles will not occur
d
Recombination of the redbrown eye and longshort aristae alleles will occur more frequently than
recombination of the alleles for wing length and body color
As Figure 134 shows by using recombination frequency to predict genetic distance we can infer the relative
gene order on chromosome 2 The values represent map distances in centimorgans cM which correspond to
recombination frequencies in percent Therefore the genes for body color and wing size were 655 485  17
cM apart indicating that the maternal and paternal alleles for these genes recombine in 17 percent of offspring
on average
To construct a chromosome map Sturtevant assumed that genes were ordered serially on threadlike
chromosomes He also assumed that the incidence of recombination between two homologous chromosomes
could occur with equal likelihood anywhere along the chromosomes length Operating under these assumptions
Sturtevant postulated that alleles that were far apart on a chromosome were more likely to dissociate during
meiosis simply because there was a larger region over which recombination could occur Conversely alleles
that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited together The average number of
crossovers between two allelesthat is their recombination frequencycorrelated with their genetic distance
from each other relative to the locations of other genes on that chromosome Considering the example cross
between AaBb and aabb above we could calculate the recombinations frequency as 501000  005 That
is the likelihood of a crossover between genes Aa and Bb was 005 or 5 percent Such a result would
indicate that the genes were definitively linked but that they were far enough apart for crossovers to occasionally
occur Sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units or centimorgans cM in which a 001 recombination
frequency corresponds to 1 cM
By representing alleles in a linear map Sturtevant suggested that genes can range from linking perfectly
recombination frequency  0 to unlinking perfectly recombination frequency  05 when genes are on different
chromosomes or genes separate very far apart on the same chromosome Perfectly unlinked genes correspond
to the frequencies Mendel predicted to assort independently in a dihybrid cross A 05 recombination frequency
indicates that 50 percent of offspring are recombinants and the other 50 percent are parental types That is
every type of allele combination is represented with equal frequency This representation allowed Sturtevant
to additively calculate distances between several genes on the same chromosome However as the genetic
distances approached 050 his predictions became less accurate because it was not clear whether the genes
