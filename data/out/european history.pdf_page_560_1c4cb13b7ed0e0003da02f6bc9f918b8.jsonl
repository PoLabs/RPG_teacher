Embodied in Gilbert Whites 17201793 The Natural History and Antiquities 
of Selborne 1789 the arcadian view assigned man a moral responsibility to 
take good care of Gods creation This strand of thought gained momentum 
in the wake of the industrial revolution and shaped the early conservation 
movement that emerged at the end of the nineteenth century
Natural Resources and Political Power
Fundamental to the imperial view of nature was a conceptual division between 
the natural world and human society Modern science and technology 
understood in terms of applied science played a crucial role in constructing and 
further deepening this dualism Physical items such as rocks soil vegetation 
climate or plants and animals became subjected to thorough scrutiny by an 
emerging professional community of natural scientists who first described 
mapped and later modified and improved nature to serve the needs of 
society 
The first stage of this process can be described as concerned with mapping 
the world and focused on the observation and classification of nature Newly 
acquainted knowledge was presented and arranged in practical terms as a 
guidance or an instrument for improving living standards and the economic 
welfare of European societies or at least their elites Scientists and researchers 
throughout Europe engaged in a massive effort to classify catalogue and 
describe natureliving organisms rocks or newlydiscovered lands in 
the colonies In the mideighteenth century when Swedish naturalist Carl 
Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae captured the variability of plant species he 
described them as stable and in so doing he created a system that ordered 
the natural world into discernible groups Around the same time the French 
chemist Antoine Lavoisier 17431794 discovered and named oxygen and 
carbon overthrowing the traditional belief that fire was caused by a mysterious 
substance of phlogiston
This first process of classification and observation developed into a second 
stage in which scientists directly focused on the exploitation of nature 
In the early nineteenth century Charles Darwins 18091882 theory of 
evolution Charles Lyells 17671849 idea of uniformitarianism and Jean
Pierre Perraudins 17671858 glacier theory all showed that nature was not 
immutable but constantly evolving Embracing the ethos of liberal capitalism 
scientific understanding thus shifted towards seeing nature as a dynamic 
result of competition between various actors and elements which needed 
to be dominated by humans and cultivated into a dependable economic 
resource Nature from now on had to be conquered and tamed Perhaps 
the most illustrative example of this view were Gregor Mendels 18221884
