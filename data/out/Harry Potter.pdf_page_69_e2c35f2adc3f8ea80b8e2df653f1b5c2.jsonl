Harry kept to his room with his new owl for company He had decided to
call her Hedwig a name he had found in A History of Magic His school
books were very interesting He lay on his bed reading late into the
night Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased It
was lucky that Aunt Petunia didnt come in to vacuum anymore because
Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice Every night before he went to
sleep Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned
to the wall counting down to September the first
On the last day of August he thought hed better speak to his aunt and
uncle about getting to Kings Cross station the next day so he went
down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on
television He cleared his throat to let them know he was there and
Dudley screamed and ran from the room
Er  Uncle Vernon
Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening
Er  I need to be at Kings Cross tomorrow to  to go to Hogwarts
Uncle Vernon grunted again
Would it be all right if you gave me a lift
Grunt Harry supposed that meant yes
Thank you
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke
Funny way to get to a wizards school the train Magic carpets all got
punctures have they
Harry didnt say anything
Where is this school anyway
I dont know said Harry realizing this for the first time He pulled
the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket
I just take the train from platform nine and threequarters at eleven
oclock he read
