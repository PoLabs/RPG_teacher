A Scandal in Bohemia
Quite so but the sequel was rather unusual I
will tell you however I left the house a little after
eight oclock this morning in the character of a groom
out of work There is a wonderful sympathy and
freemasonry among horsey men Be one of them and
you will know all that there is to know I soon found
Briony Lodge It is a bijou villa with a garden at the
back but built out in front right up to the road two
stories Chubb lock to the door Large sittingroom
on the right side well furnished with long windows
almost to the oor and those preposterous English
window fasteners which a child could open Behind
there was nothing remarkable save that the passage
window could be reached from the top of the coach
house I walked round it and examined it closely from
every point of view but without noting anything else
of interest
I then lounged down the street and found as I
expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs
down by one wall of the garden I lent the ostlers
a hand in rubbing down their horses and received
in exchange twopence a glass of half and half two
lls of shag tobacco and as much information as I
could desire about Miss Adler to say nothing of half a
dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I
was not in the least interested but whose biographies
I was compelled to listen to
And what of Irene Adler I asked
Oh she has turned all the mens heads down in
that part She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet
on this planet So say the Serpentinemews to a man
She lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at ve
every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner Sel
dom goes out at other times except when she sings
Has only one male visitor but a good deal of him
He is dark handsome and dashing never calls less
than once a day and often twice He is a Mr Godfrey
Norton of the Inner Temple See the advantages of a
cabman as a condant They had driven him home
a dozen times from Serpentinemews and knew all
about him When I had listened to all they had to tell
I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once
more and to think over my plan of campaign
This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important
factor in the matter He was a lawyer That sounded
ominous What was the relation between them and
what the object of his repeated visits Was she his
client his friend or his mistress If the former she
had probably transferred the photograph to his keep
ing If the latter it was less likely On the issue of
this question depended whether I should continue
my work at Briony Lodge or turn my attention to the
gentlemans chambers in the Temple It was a delicate
point and it widened the eld of my inquiry I fear
that I bore you with these details but I have to let you
see my little difculties if you are to understand the
situation
I am following you closely I answered
I was still balancing the matter in my mind when
a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge and a gen
tleman sprang out He was a remarkably handsome
man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently the
man of whom I had heard He appeared to be in
a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and
brushed past the maid who opened the door with the
air of a man who was thoroughly at home
He was in the house about half an hour and I
could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the
sittingroom pacing up and down talking excitedly
and waving his arms Of her I could see nothing
Presently he emerged looking even more urried
than before As he stepped up to the cab he pulled a
gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly
Drive like the devil he shouted rst to Gross 
Hankeys in Regent Street and then to the Church of
St Monica in the Edgeware Road Half a guinea if
you do it in twenty minutes
Away they went and I was just wondering
whether I should not do well to follow them when up
the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with
his coat only halfbuttoned and his tie under his ear
while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of
the buckles It hadnt pulled up before she shot out
of the hall door and into it I only caught a glimpse
of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman
with a face that a man might die for
 The Church of St Monica John she cried and
half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes
This was quite too good to lose Watson I was
just balancing whether I should run for it or whether
I should perch behind her landau when a cab came
through the street The driver looked twice at such
a shabby fare but I jumped in before he could ob
ject The Church of St Monica said I and half a
sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes It was
twentyve minutes to twelve and of course it was
clear enough what was in the wind
My cabby drove fast I dont think I ever drove
faster but the others were there before us The cab
and the landau with their steaming horses were in
front of the door when I arrived I paid the man
and hurried into the church There was not a soul
there save the two whom I had followed and a sur
pliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating
