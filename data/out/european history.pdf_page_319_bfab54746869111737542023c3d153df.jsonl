32 EMPIRE AND COLONIALISM

area west of which became the sole domain of Spanish exploration and east
including parts of South Americaof the Portuguese In 1529 the Treaty of 
Zaragoza extended the principle of imperial interest zones to Asia
Portuguese crown possessions east of the Cape of Good Hope were 
known as Estado da India from 1505 These possessionshome to powerful 
political entities heavily populated and technologically partly superior to 
Europewere built on older commercial networks Politically the Portuguese 
Empire was not homogeneous but adapted to the diversity of its territories 
and peoples In the seventeenth century as it increasingly lost positions in 
Asia to the Dutch it transformed into a more territorial empire in Brazil The 
Spanish conquest of the Americas by comparison spread from the Caribbean 
Though the first voyages had mostly mercantile aims the search for precious 
metals encouraged the appropriation of American territory The conquest of 
the Philippines in 1656 in turn opened a transPacific trade route linking the 
Philippines and East Asia with the Viceroyalty of New Spain in the Americas 
Spanish and Portuguese colonial societies operated with a high degree of 
autonomy Rather than think of Spain and Portugal as centralised empires 
we should see them as multikingdom monarchies made up of European and 
overseas elements with multiple authorities 
The Spanish conquest of the native empires was partly justified with 
reference to the civilisation of indigenous peoples After the conquest of 
MexicoTenochtitlan Hernn Corts 14851546 explained the importance of 
this expansion in a letter 1520 to Charles V who had just been crowned Holy 
Roman Emperor in Aachen
The possession of this country would authorise your Majesty to assume anew the title 
of Emperor which it is no less worthy of conferring than Germany which by the grace of 
God you already possess
Later American silver helped to finance the Spanish struggle against 
Protestantism underlining the monarchys Catholic nature
By the eighteenth century Spain still retained most of its American 
possessions Portugal in turn following the demise of the Estado da India and 
the discovery of gold and diamonds in Brazil began to colonise the interior 
of the territory At the same time the use of terms like empire and colonies 
in official documentation reflected the Iberian desire to use the Atlantic to 
promote Portugal and Spain as firstrate powers
In northwestern Europe coherent attempts to gain a foothold outside 
Europe started in the late sixteenth century The English and Dutch are often 
characterised as merchant empires but the term is misleading The private 
companies running the colonies operated with strong governmental support 
What looked like trading companies in Europe operated as conquerors and 
colonisers overseas
