CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
24 Describe the different cell types and their
functions in sponges
25 Describe the feeding mechanism of sponges and
identify how it is different from other animals
26 Explain the function of nematocysts in cnidarians
27 Compare the structural differences between
Porifera and Cnidaria
28 Compare the differences in sexual reproduction
between Porifera and Cubozoans How does the
difference in fertilization provide an evolutionary
advantage to the Cubozoans
29 How does the tapeworm body plan support
widespread dissemination of the parasite
30 Describe the morphology and anatomy of
mollusks
31 What are the anatomical differences between
nemertines and mollusks
32 How does a change in the circulatory system
organization support the body designs in
cephalopods compared to other mollusks
33 Enumerate features of Caenorhabditis elegans
that make it a valuable model system for biologists
