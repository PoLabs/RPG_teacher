Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and Harry was left to find
the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest

watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the Dursleys would
remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now
Five minutes to go Harry heard something creak outside He hoped the
roof wasnt going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did
Four minutes to go Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of
letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehow
Three minutes to go Was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like

the rock crumbling into the sea
One minute to go and hed be eleven Thirty seconds twenty  ten
nine  maybe hed wake Dudley up just to annoy him  three two
one

The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright staring at the
