The First Law of Thermodynamics
The first law of thermodynamics deals with the total amount of energy in the universe It states that this
total amount of energy is constant In other words there has always been and always will be exactly the
same amount of energy in the universe Energy exists in many different forms According to the first law of
thermodynamics energy may transfer from place to place or transform into different forms but it cannot be
created or destroyed The transfers and transformations of energy take place around us all the time Light bulbs
transform electrical energy into light energy Gas stoves transform chemical energy from natural gas into heat
energy Plants perform one of the most biologically useful energy transformations on earth that of converting
sunlight energy into the chemical energy stored within organic molecules Figure 62 Figure 611 examples of
energy transformations
The challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer
or transform into usable energy to do work Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge very well Chemical
energy stored within organic molecules such as sugars and fats transforms through a series of cellular chemical
reactions into energy within ATP molecules Energy in ATP molecules is easily accessible to do work Examples
of the types of work that cells need to do include building complex molecules transporting materials powering
the beating motion of cilia or flagella contracting muscle fibers to create movement and reproduction
Figure 611 Here are two examples of energy transferring from one system to another and transformed from one form
to another Humans can convert the chemical energy in food like this ice cream cone into kinetic energy the energy
of movement to ride a bicycle Plants can convert electromagnetic radiation light energy from the sun into chemical

The Second Law of Thermodynamics
A living cells primary tasks of obtaining transforming and using energy to do work may seem simple However
the second law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear None of the energy
transfers that we have discussed along with all energy transfers and transformations in the universe is
completely efficient In every energy transfer some amount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable In most
cases this form is heat energy Thermodynamically scientists define heat energy as energy that transfers from
one system to another that is not doing work For example when an airplane flies through the air it loses some of
its energy as heat energy due to friction with the surrounding air This friction actually heats the air by temporarily
increasing air molecule speed Likewise some energy is lost as heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions
This is good for warmblooded creatures like us because heat energy helps to maintain our body temperature
Strictly speaking no energy transfer is completely efficient because some energy is lost in an unusable form
An important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder or randomness The more energy that a
system loses to its surroundings the less ordered and more random the system Scientists refer to the measure
of randomness or disorder within a system as entropy High entropy means high disorder and low energy
Figure 612 To better understand entropy think of a students bedroom If no energy or work were put into
it the room would quickly become messy It would exist in a very disordered state one of high entropy Energy
must be put into the system in the form of the student doing work and putting everything away in order to bring
the room back to a state of cleanliness and order This state is one of low entropy Similarly a car or house must
be constantly maintained with work in order to keep it in an ordered state Left alone a houses or cars entropy
gradually increases through rust and degradation Molecules and chemical reactions have varying amounts of
entropy as well For example as chemical reactions reach a state of equilibrium entropy increases and as
molecules at a high concentration in one place diffuse and spread out entropy also increases
