Harry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said
DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand but I dont want everybody
knowing youve got a broomstick or theyll all want one Oliver Wood
will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven oclock for your
first training session
Professor McGonagall
Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to
read
A Nimbus Two Thousand Ron moaned enviously Ive never even touched
one
They left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private
before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they
found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle Malfoy seized the
package from Harry and felt it
Thats a broomstick he said throwing it back to Harry with a mixture
of jealousy and spite on his face Youll be in for it this time
Potter first years arent allowed them
Ron couldnt resist it
Its not any old broomstick he said its a Nimbus Two Thousand
What did you say youve got at home Malfoy a Comet Two Sixty Ron
grinned at Harry Comets look flashy but theyre not in the same
league as the Nimbus
What would you know about it Weasley you couldnt afford half the
handle Malfoy snapped back I suppose you and your brothers have to
save up twig by twig
Before Ron could answer Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoys elbow
Not arguing I hope boys he squeaked
