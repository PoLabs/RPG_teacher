54 LABOUR AND FORCED LABOUR
667
Great Britain eventually outlawed the slave trade in 1807 and slavery 
itself was gradually abolished during the nineteenth century Denmark
Norway 1803 United Kingdom 1833 Brazil 1888 This was certainly a move 
towards freer labour relations but various forms of unfree labourranging 
from universal compulsory conscription introduced in the 1790s to convict 
leasing and various forms of modern chattel slaverycontinue to exist even 
in the present
Conclusion
For the most part the seemingly clearcut distinction between free and unfree 
labour obscures the fact that the distinction is in fact one of degree rather than 
kind Furthermore all of these categories were found all over early modern 
Europe Research since the 1960s has shown that early modern economic 
developmentas in most contemporary developing countrieshinged on 
the intensification of labour Adapted to local and regional circumstances and 
typically supported by state power preindustrial landowners and merchant
capitalists invested in productive capabilities ranging from agricultural 
improvements to protoindustrial ventures to integration into longdistance 
trade These dynamics were highly variegated and geographically diffuse 
Hence rather than dividing Europe between for example free western and 
unfree eastern parts it is more helpful to think about economically active 
hotspots both rural and urban embedded within distinctively premodern 
social relations that persisted well into the nineteenth century
