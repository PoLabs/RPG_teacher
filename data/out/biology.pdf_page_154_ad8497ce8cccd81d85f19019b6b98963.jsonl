51  Components and Structure
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Understand the cell membrane fluid mosaic model

Describe phospholipid protein and carbohydrate functions in membranes

Discuss membrane fluidity
A cells plasma membrane defines the cell outlines its borders and determines the nature of its interaction with
its environment see Table 51 for a summary Cells exclude some substances take in others and excrete still
others all in controlled quantities The plasma membrane must be very flexible to allow certain cells such as
red and white blood cells to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries These are the more obvious
plasma membrane functions In addition the plasma membranes surface carries markers that allow cells to
recognize one another which is vital for tissue and organ formation during early development and which later
plays a role in the immune responses self versus nonself distinction
Among the most sophisticated plasma membrane functions is the ability for complex integral proteins receptors
to transmit signals These proteins act both as extracellular input receivers and as intracellular processing
activators These membrane receptors provide extracellular attachment sites for effectors like hormones and
growth factors and they activate intracellular response cascades when their effectors are bound Occasionally
viruses hijack receptors HIV human immunodeficiency virus is one example that use them to gain entry into
cells and at times the genes encoding receptors become mutated causing the signal transduction process to
malfunction with disastrous consequences
Fluid Mosaic Model
Scientists identified the plasma membrane in the 1890s and its chemical components in 1915 The principal
components they identified were lipids and proteins In 1935 Hugh Davson and James Danielli proposed the
plasma membranes structure This was the first model that others in the scientific community widely accepted
It was based on the plasma membranes railroad track appearance in early electron micrographs Davson
and Danielli theorized that the plasma membranes structure resembles a sandwich They made the analogy of
proteins to bread and lipids to the filling In the 1950s advances in microscopy notably transmission electron
microscopy TEM allowed researchers to see that the plasma membranes core consisted of a double rather
than a single layer In 1972 SJ Singer and Garth L Nicolson proposed a new model that provides microscopic
observations and better explains plasma membrane function
The explanation the fluid mosaic model has evolved somewhat over time but it still best accounts for
plasma membrane structure and function as we now understand them The fluid mosaic model describes the
plasma membrane structure as a mosaic of componentsincluding phospholipids cholesterol proteins and
carbohydratesthat gives the membrane a fluid character Plasma membranes range from 5 to 10 nm in
thickness For comparison human red blood cells visible via light microscopy are approximately 8 m wide
or approximately 1000 times wider than a plasma membrane The membrane does look a bit like a sandwich
