212 Virus Infections and Hosts
Plant viruses may be transmitted either vertically from parent reproductive cells or horizontally through
damaged plant tissues Viruses of plants are responsible for significant economic damage in both crop plants
and plants used for ornamentation Animal viruses enter their hosts through several types of virushost cell
interactions and cause a variety of infections Viral infections can be either acute with a brief period of infection
terminated by host immune responses or chronic in which the infection persists Persistent infections may
cause chronic symptoms hepatitis C intermittent symptoms latent viruses such a herpes simplex virus 1 or
even be effectively asymptomatic human herpesviruses 6 and 7 Oncogenic viruses in animals have the
ability to cause cancer by interfering with the regulation of the host cell cycle
213 Prevention and Treatment of Viral Infections
Viruses cause a variety of diseases in humans Many of these diseases can be prevented by the use of viral
vaccines which stimulate protective immunity against the virus without causing major disease Viral vaccines
may also be used in active viral infections boosting the ability of the immune system to control or destroy the
virus A series of antiviral drugs that target enzymes and other protein products of viral genes have been
developed and used with mixed success Combinations of antiHIV drugs have been used to effectively control
the virus extending the lifespans of infected individuals Viruses have many uses in medicines such as in the
treatment of genetic disorders cancer and bacterial infections
214 Other Acellular Entities Prions and Viroids
Prions are infectious agents that consist of protein but no DNA or RNA and seem to produce their deadly
effects by duplicating their shapes and accumulating in tissues They are thought to contribute to several
progressive brain disorders including mad cow disease and CreutzfeldtJakob disease Viroids are single
stranded RNA pathogens that infect plants Their presence can have a severe impact on the agriculture
industry
