constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues This process
primes or sensitizes the tissue Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen IgE molecules on mast cells
bind the antigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino acids
histamine and serotonin these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses
Figure 4226 shows an example of an allergic response to ragweed pollen The effects of an allergic reaction
range from mild symptoms like sneezing and itchy watery eyes to more severe or even lifethreatening reactions
involving intensely itchy welts or hives airway contraction with severe respiratory distress and plummeting blood
pressure This extreme reaction is known as anaphylactic shock If not treated with epinephrine to counter the
blood pressure and breathing effects this condition can be fatal
Figure 4226 On first exposure to an allergen an IgE antibody is synthesized by plasma cells in response to a
harmless antigen The IgE molecules bind to mast cells and on secondary exposure the mast cells release histamines
and other modulators that affect the symptoms of allergy credit modification of work by NIH
Delayed hypersensitivity is a cellmediated immune response that takes approximately one to two days after
secondary exposure for a maximal reaction to be observed This type of hypersensitivity involves the TH1
cytokinemediated inflammatory response and may manifest as local tissue lesions or contact dermatitis rash
or skin irritation Delayed hypersensitivity occurs in some individuals in response to contact with certain types
of jewelry or cosmetics Delayed hypersensitivity facilitates the immune response to poison ivy and is also the
reason why the skin test for tuberculosis results in a small region of inflammation on individuals who were
previously exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis That is also why cortisone is used to treat such responses
it will inhibit cytokine production
Autoimmunity
Autoimmunity is a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the
population Most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response Antibodies that inappropriately
mark self components as foreign are termed autoantibodies In patients with the autoimmune disease
myasthenia gravis muscle cell receptors that induce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by
antibodies The result is muscle weakness that may include marked difficultly with fine andor gross motor
functions In systemic lupus erythematosus a diffuse autoantibody response to the individuals own DNA and
