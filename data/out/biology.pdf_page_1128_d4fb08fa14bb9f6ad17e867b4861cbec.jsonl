Density of Mechanoreceptors
The distribution of touch receptors in human skin is not consistent over the body In humans touch receptors
are less dense in skin covered with any type of hair such as the arms legs torso and face Touch receptors
are denser in glabrous skin the type found on human fingertips and lips for example which is typically more
sensitive and is thicker than hairy skin 4 to 5 mm versus 2 to 3 mm
How is receptor density estimated in a human subject The relative density of pressure receptors in different
locations on the body can be demonstrated experimentally using a twopoint discrimination test In this
demonstration two sharp points such as two thumbtacks are brought into contact with the subjects skin
though not hard enough to cause pain or break the skin The subject reports if he or she feels one point or two
points If the two points are felt as one point it can be inferred that the two points are both in the receptive field
of a single sensory receptor If two points are felt as two separate points each is in the receptive field of two
separate sensory receptors The points could then be moved closer and retested until the subject reports feeling
only one point and the size of the receptive field of a single receptor could be estimated from that distance
Thermoreception
In addition to Krause end bulbs that detect cold and Ruffini endings that detect warmth there are different types
of cold receptors on some free nerve endings thermoreceptors located in the dermis skeletal muscles liver
and hypothalamus that are activated by different temperatures Their pathways into the brain run from the spinal
cord through the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex Warmth and cold information from the face
travels through one of the cranial nerves to the brain You know from experience that a tolerably cold or hot
stimulus can quickly progress to a much more intense stimulus that is no longer tolerable Any stimulus that is
too intense can be perceived as pain because temperature sensations are conducted along the same pathways
that carry pain sensations
Pain
Pain is the name given to nociception which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue
damage Pain is caused by true sources of injury such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn
or contact with a corrosive chemical But pain also can be caused by harmless stimuli that mimic the action of
damaging stimuli such as contact with capsaicins the compounds that cause peppers to taste hot and which
are used in selfdefense pepper sprays and certain topical medications Peppers taste hot because the protein
receptors that bind capsaicin open the same calcium channels that are activated by warm receptors
Nociception starts at the sensory receptors but pain inasmuch as it is the perception of nociception does not
start until it is communicated to the brain There are several nociceptive pathways to and through the brain
Most axons carrying nociceptive information into the brain from the spinal cord project to the thalamus as do
other sensory neurons and the neural signal undergoes final processing in the primary somatosensory cortex
Interestingly one nociceptive pathway projects not to the thalamus but directly to the hypothalamus in the
forebrain which modulates the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine functions of the autonomic nervous system
Recall that threateningor painfulstimuli stimulate the sympathetic branch of the visceral sensory system
