Figure 431 A gap junction is a proteinlined pore that allows water and small molecules to pass between adjacent
animal cells credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal
Gap junctions develop when a set of six proteins connexins in the plasma membrane arrange themselves in
an elongated donutlike configuration  a connexon When the connexons pores doughnut holes in adjacent
animal cells align a channel between the two cells forms Gap junctions are particularly important in cardiac
muscle The electrical signal for the muscle to contract passes efficiently through gap junctions allowing the
heart muscle cells to contract in tandem
