Austrian HabsburgsCatholic powersdemonstrating that dynastic rivalry 
could trump religious concordance Fighting was not continuous over the 
thirty years as historians traditionally divide the conflict into four phases 
1 the Bohemian Period 16181625 2 the Danish Period 16251630 3 the 
Swedish Period 16301635 and 4 the SwedishFrench Period 16351648 
The scale of the fighting during the war was unprecedented and so were the 
effects of the war on civilians especially in the German lands
The Thirty Years War ended with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 after years 
of negotiations involving all the states active in the conflict rather than two or 
three of the major participants This was unprecedented and would serve as a 
model for peace negotiations for centuries to come consolidating as it did the 
development of permanent diplomatic representation and the commitment 
of powerful European states to guaranteeing peace settlements Diplomacy 
as a distinct institution only developed from the sixteenth century onwards 
and became increasingly welldefined across the early modern period with 
the Peace of Westphalia giving its evolution a significant boost France and 
Sweden gained the most from the peace settlement as France replaced Spain 
as the preeminent power on the continent and Sweden gained several northern 
territories of the Holy Roman Empire The Habsburgs were the greatest losers 
of the peace settlement as the Spanish recognised Dutch independence and 
the Austrians ceded autonomy to the Swiss Confederation and the German 
princes of the Holy Roman Empire
During the early modern period through to the last quarter of the seventeenth 
century armies consisting of relatively illtrained rapidly recruited troops were 
the norm in Europe This changed dramatically after the Peace of Westphalia 
as sovereigns were wary of troops who were often more loyal to commanding 
officers nearly always noblemen than to distant political rulers The most 
significant example of the establishment and growth of standing armies in the 
second half of the seventeenth century is France which had an army of about 
55000 troops in the 1660s under the reign of Louis XIV 16381715 five times 
larger than any preceding standing army and the largest in Europe besides 
that of the Ottoman Empire These troops were better trained and reflect the 
importance of the rise of the fiscalmilitary state as maintaining such a large 
army required a more centralised bureaucracy capable of raising the necessary 
funds Louis XIV fought three wars in the seventeenth century the War of 
Devolution 16671668 the Dutch War 16721678 and the War of the League 
of Augsburg 16881697 The first two wars were spectacularly successful for 
Louis XIV gaining France new territory in the Spanish Netherlands and the 
western lands of the Holy Roman Empire This demonstrated the success of 
the new military machine created under Louis XIVs rule with the help of 
his Minister of War Michel Le Tellier 16031685 and his son the Marquis
