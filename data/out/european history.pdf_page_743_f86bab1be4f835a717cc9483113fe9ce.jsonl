eyes of many By the early 2000s however the strengthening of religiosity had 
faded while the number of groups claiming to be religious in their own way 
or to practise their religiosity specifically outside of church organisations was 
increasing The number of believers continued to decline in the 2010s while 
the appeal of nontraditional denominations and the socalled small churches 
increased Furthermore the number of people who do not even comment on 
their religion or worldview in opinion polls is continually growing
Conclusion
The ideas presented analyse the trajectories of religions in Europe throughout 
the twentieth century Beginning with the official separation of church and 
state in 1905 in France the different relationships that religious institutions 
have established with the state are presented In Russia the Civil War and 
Bolshevik policies after 1917 brought about a secularisation that in practice 
resulted in the persecution of religious practices and the cornering of the 
Orthodox Church until for the needs of the Second World War Stalin restored 
a relative normality to religious life In other regions of Europe for example 
in the Balkan area the interwar period involved a process of construction 
of national states that based their national identity on features of religious 
homogeneity which led to the persecution and expulsion of minorities that did 
not conform to these identity patterns the Armenian Genocide being a clear 
example of this In Spain the Church in its strategy of survival after years of 
secularist republicanism allied itself from 1939 with the Franco dictatorship to 
restore its sphere of power until at least the 1960s For their part the religions 
of the countries in the Soviet sphere of influence saw their presence in society 
greatly reduced with the exception of Poland until well into the 1980s when 
Gorbachev relaxed the pressure on churches In this whole process the Second 
Vatican Council and its redefinition of the principles and values that defined 
the Catholic Church as well as its relationship with the population and with 
other religions marked a turning point in the changes that crystallised at the 
end of the century with the restructuring of the world after the fall of the Berlin 
Wall
