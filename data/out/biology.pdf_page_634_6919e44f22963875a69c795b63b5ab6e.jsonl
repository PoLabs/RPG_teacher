Nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria Denitrification is also performed by bacteria and transforms nitrate
from soils into gaseous nitrogen compounds such as N2O NO and N2
224 Bacterial Diseases in Humans
Some prokaryotes are human pathogens Devastating diseases and plagues have been among us since early
times and remain among the leading causes of death worldwide Emerging diseases are those rapidly
increasing in incidence or geographic range They can be new or reemerging diseases previously under
control Many emerging diseases affecting humans originate in animals zoonoses such as brucellosis A
group of reemerging bacterial diseases recently identified by WHO for monitoring include bubonic plague
diphtheria and cholera Foodborne diseases result from the consumption of food contaminated with food
pathogenic bacteria viruses or parasites
Some bacterial infections have been associated with biofilms Legionnaires disease otitis media and infection
of patients with cystic fibrosis Biofilms can grow on human tissues like dental plaque colonize medical
devices and cause infection or produce foodborne disease by growing on the surfaces of food and food
processing equipment Biofilms are resistant to most of the methods used to control microbial growth The
excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in a major global problem since resistant forms of bacteria have been
selected over time A very dangerous strain methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA has wreaked
havoc recently across the world
225 Beneficial Prokaryotes
Pathogens are only a small percentage of all prokaryotes In fact prokaryotes provide essential services to
humans and other organisms Nitrogen which is not usable by eukaryotes in its plentiful atmospheric form can
be fixed or converted into ammonia NH3 either biologically or abiotically Biological nitrogen fixation BNF is
exclusively carried out by prokaryotes and constitutes the second most important biological process on Earth
Although some terrestrial nitrogen is fixed by freeliving bacteria most BNF comes from the symbiotic
interaction between soil rhizobia and the roots of legume plants
Human life is only possible due to the action of microbes both those in the environment and those species that
call us home Internally they help us digest our food produce vital nutrients for us protect us from pathogenic
microbes and help train our immune systems to function properly
Microbial bioremediation is the use of microbial metabolism to remove pollutants Bioremediation has been
used to remove agricultural chemicals that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface Toxic metals
and oxides such as selenium and arsenic compounds can also be removed by bioremediation Probably one
of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the
cleanup of oil spills
VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS
1 Figure 228 Compared to freefloating bacteria
bacteria in biofilms often show increased resistance
to antibiotics and detergents Why do you think this
might be the case
2 Figure 2216 Which of the following statements is

Grampositive and Gramnegative bacteria
c
The cell wall of Gramnegative bacteria is
thick and the cell wall of Grampositive
bacteria is thin
d
Gramnegative bacteria have a cell wall
made of peptidoglycan whereas Gram
positive bacteria have a cell wall made of
lipoteichoic acid
3 Figure 2219 Which of the following statements
about the nitrogen cycle is false
a
Nitrogen fixing bacteria exist on the root
nodules of legumes and in the soil
b
Denitrifying bacteria convert nitrates NO3
into nitrogen gas N2
c
Ammonification is the process by which
ammonium ion NH4 is released from
decomposing organic compounds
