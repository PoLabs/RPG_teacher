protein called RAS which activates the MAP kinase pathway described earlier The enzyme MAP kinase then
stimulates the expression of proteins that interact with other cellular components to initiate cell division
Cancer Biologist
Cancer biologists study the molecular origins of cancer with the goal of developing new prevention methods
and treatment strategies that will inhibit the growth of tumors without harming the normal cells of the
body As mentioned earlier signaling pathways control cell growth These signaling pathways are controlled
by signaling proteins which are in turn expressed by genes Mutations in these genes can result in
malfunctioning signaling proteins This prevents the cell from regulating its cell cycle triggering unrestricted
cell division and perhaps cancer The genes that regulate the signaling proteins are one type of oncogene
which is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer The gene encoding RAS is an oncogene that
was originally discovered when mutations in the RAS protein were linked to cancer Further studies have
indicated that 30 percent of cancer cells have a mutation in the RAS gene that leads to uncontrolled growth
If left unchecked uncontrolled cell division can lead to tumor formation and metastasis the growth of cancer
cells in new locations in the body
Cancer biologists have been able to identify many other oncogenes that contribute to the development of
cancer For example HER2 is a cellsurface receptor that is present in excessive amounts in 20 percent
of human breast cancers Cancer biologists realized that gene duplication led to HER2 overexpression in
25 percent of breast cancer patients and developed a drug called Herceptin trastuzumab Herceptin is
a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2 for removal by the immune system Herceptin therapy helps to
control signaling through HER2 The use of Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy has helped to
increase the overall survival rate of patients with metastatic breast cancer

Cell Death
When a cell is damaged superfluous or potentially dangerous to an organism a cell can initiate a mechanism to
trigger programmed cell death or apoptosis Apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents
the release of potentially damaging molecules from inside the cell There are many internal checkpoints that
monitor a cells health if abnormalities are observed a cell can spontaneously initiate the process of apoptosis
However in some cases such as a viral infection or uncontrolled cell division due to cancer the cells normal
checks and balances fail External signaling can also initiate apoptosis For example most normal animal cells
have receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix a network of glycoproteins that provides structural
support for cells in an organism The binding of cellular receptors to the extracellular matrix initiates a signaling
cascade within the cell However if the cell moves away from the extracellular matrix the signaling ceases and
the cell undergoes apoptosis This system keeps cells from traveling through the body and proliferating out of
control as happens with tumor cells that metastasize
Another example of external signaling that leads to apoptosis occurs in Tcell development Tcells are immune
cells that bind to foreign macromolecules and particles and target them for destruction by the immune system
Normally Tcells do not target self proteins those of their own organism a process that can lead to
autoimmune diseases In order to develop the ability to discriminate between self and nonself immature Tcells
undergo screening to determine whether they bind to socalled self proteins If the Tcell receptor binds to self
proteins the cell initiates apoptosis to remove the potentially dangerous cell
Apoptosis is also essential for normal embryological development In vertebrates for example early stages of
development include the formation of weblike tissue between individual fingers and toes Figure 915 During
the course of normal development these unneeded cells must be eliminated enabling fully separated fingers
and toes to form A cell signaling mechanism triggers apoptosis which destroys the cells between the developing
digits
