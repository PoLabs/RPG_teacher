and texture The sweet tissue of the blackberry the red flesh of the tomato the shell of the peanut and the hull
of corn the tough thin part that gets stuck in your teeth when you eat popcorn are all fruits As the fruit matures
the seeds also mature
Fruits may be classified as simple aggregate multiple or accessory depending on their origin Figure 3222
If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary it is known as a simple fruit as seen
in nuts and beans An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel but all are in the same
flower the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit as seen in the raspberry Multiple fruit develops
from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers An example is the pineapple where the flowers fuse together to
form the fruit Accessory fruits sometimes called false fruits are not derived from the ovary but from another
part of the flower such as the receptacle strawberry or the hypanthium apples and pears
Figure 3222 There are four main types of fruits Simple fruits such as these nuts are derived from a single ovary
Aggregate fruits like raspberries form from many carpels that fuse together Multiple fruits such as pineapple form
from a cluster of flowers called an inflorescence Accessory fruit like the apple are formed from a part of the plant

Fruits generally have three parts the exocarp the outermost skin or covering the mesocarp middle part of
the fruit and the endocarp the inner part of the fruit Together all three are known as the pericarp The
mesocarp is usually the fleshy edible part of the fruit however in some fruits such as the almond the endocarp
is the edible part In many fruits two or all three of the layers are fused and are indistinguishable at maturity
Fruits can be dry or fleshy Furthermore fruits can be divided into dehiscent or indehiscent types Dehiscent
fruits such as peas readily release their seeds while indehiscent fruits like peaches rely on decay to release
their seeds
Fruit and Seed Dispersal
The fruit has a single purpose seed dispersal Seeds contained within fruits need to be dispersed far from the
