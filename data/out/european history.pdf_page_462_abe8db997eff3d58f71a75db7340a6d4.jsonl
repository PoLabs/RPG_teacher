to extend their domination around the globe and to exploit their domains with 
greater efficiency while those residing in the colonies and in the independent 
countries beyond Europe including Japan the Ottoman Empire Latin 
American republics and the Kingdom of Hawaii creatively appropriated 
both science and technology in an effort to resist European and American 
imperialism and to strengthen their own position in the worldin military

The turn of the nineteenth century saw in addition to political upheaval and a 
new ordering of the empires and nations of Europe other events understood 
as revolutionary Chemistry for example underwent dramatic changes the 
introduction of modern elements the story of oxygen and Antoine de Lavoisier 
is wellknown animal electricity Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta 
chemical formula the periodic system Dmitri I Mendeleev and the chemistry 
of lifethe conceptual innovations of this fledgling discipline were spread 
across Europe Like pearls on a chronological chain these discoveries help to 
illustrate in retrospect a notion of scientific progress that became the pride 
of the emerging professions of academic researchers and teachers However 
recent historiography of science has taken a skeptical stance on such a notion 
of progress and its focus on individuals Nevertheless chemistry illustrates 
the technological and economic potential of science for the nineteenthcentury 
state Entire industries were built around the knowledge of carbon compounds 
that were isolated from industrial mining products such as coal tar and these 
industries would later change the material world through innovations in 
hygiene pharmaceuticals nutrition or textiles 
The extent to which the sciences were a source of material wealth as well as 
a secularising force can be demonstrated by the most important development 
in nineteenthcentury biology the theory of biological species formation 
through variation and selectionevolutionas formulated by the Victorian 
scientist Charles Darwin Darwins theory was tied to geological insights into 
the long history of the Earth fossils and to practices of breeding The rules 
of heredity first analysed by the famous pea crossbreeding experiments of 
Moravian monk Gregor Mendel were only rediscovered in 1900 Evolution 
promoted a secular account of the descent of humankind becoming thereby 
both a cornerstone of a modern scientific worldview as well as an object of 
contestation by religion The theory of natural selectionof species changing 
and adapting to their environments over timehas of course changed its 
purview dramatically in the past 150 years The theory also reveals sciences 
connections to the exploration of the world by European powers Darwins
