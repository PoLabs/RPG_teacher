64 GENERATIONS AND LIFECYCLES

Furthermore nineteenthcentury families tended to have more children than 
todays norm Familial living spaces were much more crowded and multiple 
people would have to share one room Lastly unlike today many flats did not 
have their own sanitary facilities The apartment building instead had common 
facilities in a space shared by multiple families The United Kingdom remained 
a notable exception to the apartment model which still today dominates most 
urban areas of Europe There workingclass families were predominantly 
housed in singlefamily houses which remain ubiquitous today in Britains 
old industrial cities
Although early industrialisation and urbanisation initially raised mortality 
this effect eventually waned and gave way to increased populations and 
prolonged lifecycles with mortality rates strongly reduced all over Europe 
The mass production of canned and shelfstaple foods now relatively 
cheap enabled Europeans to consume a healthier and more varied diet with 
improved nutritional values This was further supported by cheap industrial 
yet nutritious products such as meat extracts and especially by advancements 
in medicine public health measures and improvements to public sanitation 
These trends led to Europeans growing older backed by the invention of 
vaccinations and the emergence of bacteriology More and more infants born 
to European families now lived to see childhood and adulthood Of course the 
decline of infant mortality varied greatly across Europe and even regionally 
within European countries A few examples from 1800 to 1900 the number of 
deaths per 1000 live births dropped from 200 to 100 in Sweden while England 
and Wales saw a slower decrease from about 150 in 1840 to 125 in 1880 before 
registering an increase to the previous level by 1900 followed by a sharp 
decline In Austria infant mortality decreased from just over 300 in the 1830s 
to around 200 in 1900
The demographic transition that the European continent was undergoing 
at the time did not just lead to a rejuvenation of the population Better health 
conditions also led to the ageing of populations albeit unevenly distributed in 
Europe At the end of the eighteenth century only one in five French people 
reached their sixtieth birthday but by the beginning of the twentieth century 
more than one in two would live to see it 
Old age was not only distributed geographically It also became more than 
ever in the nineteenth century a matter of social class The promise of deserved 
rest after work was slow to be fulfilled for workingclass populations Although 
mutual aid funds which included oldage allowances developed during the 
nineteenth century many indigent old people still depended on public charity 
or that of religious orders In France assistance became a recognised right 
for the elderly and the disabled in 1905 but it still had to be earned In the 
hospices that replaced the general hospital the elderly were housed in vast 
dormitories forced to work required to respect strict schedules and to behave
