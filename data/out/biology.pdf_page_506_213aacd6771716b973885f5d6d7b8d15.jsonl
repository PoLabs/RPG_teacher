Whether or not a trait is favorable depends on the current environmental conditions The same traits are not
always selected because environmental conditions can change For example consider a plant species that grew
in a moist climate and did not need to conserve water Large leaves were selected because they allowed the
plant to obtain more energy from the sun Large leaves require more water to maintain than small leaves and the
moist environment provided favorable conditions to support large leaves After thousands of years the climate
changed and the area no longer had excess water The direction of natural selection shifted so that plants
with small leaves were selected because those populations were able to conserve water to survive the new
environmental conditions
The evolution of species has resulted in enormous variation in form and function Sometimes evolution gives
rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other We call two species that evolve
in diverse directions from a common point divergent evolution We can see such divergent evolution in the
forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies however they can
look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of
pollinators Figure 185
Figure 185 Flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor Notice that the a dense blazing star Liatrus spicata
and the b purple coneflower Echinacea purpurea vary in appearance yet both share a similar basic morphology

In other cases similar phenotypes evolve independently in distantly related species For example flight has
evolved in both bats and insects and they both have structures we refer to as wings which are adaptations
to flight However bat and insect wings have evolved from very different original structures We call this
phenomenon convergent evolution where similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a
common ancestry The two species came to the same function flying but did so separately from each other
These physical changes occur over enormous time spans and help explain how evolution occurs Natural
selection acts on individual organisms which can then shape an entire species Although natural selection may
work in a single generation on an individual it can take thousands or even millions of years for an entire species
genotype to evolve It is over these large time spans that life on earth has changed and continues to change
Evidence of Evolution
The evidence for evolution is compelling and extensive Looking at every level of organization in living systems
biologists see the signature of past and present evolution Darwin dedicated a large portion of his book On the
Origin of Species to identifying patterns in nature that were consistent with evolution and since Darwin our
understanding has become clearer and broader
Fossils
Fossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those today and fossils show
a progression of evolution Scientists determine the age of fossils and categorize them from all over the world to
determine when the organisms lived relative to each other The resulting fossil record tells the story of the past
and shows the evolution of form over millions of years Figure 186 For example scientists have recovered
highly detailed records showing the evolution of humans and horses Figure 186 The whale flipper shares
a similar morphology to bird and mammal appendages Figure 187 indicating that these species share a
common ancestor
