as those behaviors convey a fitness advantage These instinctual behaviors may then be applied in special
circumstances to other species as long as it doesnt lower the animals fitness
Finding Sex Partners
Not all animals reproduce sexually but many that do have the same challenge they need to find a suitable
mate and often have to compete with other individuals to obtain one Significant energy is spent in the process
of locating attracting and mating with the sex partner Two types of selection occur during this process
intersexual selection where individuals of one sex choose mates of the other sex and intrasexual selection
the competition for mates between species members of the same sex Intersexual selection is often complex
because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual aural tactile and chemical cues An example of
intersexual selection is when female peacocks choose to mate with the male with the brightest plumage This
type of selection often leads to traits in the chosen sex that do not enhance survival but are those traits most
attractive to the opposite sex often at the expense of survival Intrasexual selection involves mating displays
and aggressive mating rituals such as rams butting headsthe winner of these battles is the one that is able to
mate Many of these rituals use up considerable energy but result in the selection of the healthiest strongest
andor most dominant individuals for mating
Three general mating systems all involving innate as opposed to learned behaviors are seen in animal
populations monogamous polygynous and polyandrous

In monogamous systems one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season In some
animals such as the gray wolf these associations can last much longer even a lifetime Several theories may
explain this type of mating system The mateguarding hypothesis states that males stay with the female to
prevent other males from mating with her This behavior is advantageous in such situations where mates are
scarce and difficult to find Another explanation is the maleassistance hypothesis where males that help guard
and rear their young will have more and healthier offspring Monogamy is observed in many bird populations
where in addition to the parental care from the female the male is also a major provider of parental care
for the chicks A third explanation for the evolutionary advantages of monogamy is the femaleenforcement
hypothesis In this scenario the female ensures that the male does not have other offspring that might compete
with her own so she actively interferes with the males signaling to attract other mates
Polygynous mating refers to one male mating with multiple females In these situations the female must be
responsible for most of the parental care as the single male is not capable of providing care to that many
offspring In resourcedbased polygyny males compete for territories with the best resources and then mate with
females that enter the territory drawn to its resource richness The female benefits by mating with a dominant
genetically fit male however it is at the cost of having no male help in caring for the offspring An example is
seen in the yellowrumped honeyguide a bird whose males defend beehives because the females feed on their
wax As the females approach the male defending the nest will mate with them Harem mating structures are
a type of polygynous system where certain males dominate mating while controlling a territory with resources
Harem mating occurs in elephant seals where the alpha male dominates the mating within the group A third
type of polygyny is a lek system Here there is a communal courting area where several males perform elaborate
displays for females and the females choose their mate from this group This behavior is observed in several
bird species including the sage grouse and the prairie chicken
In polyandrous mating systems one female mates with many males These types of systems are much rarer
than monogamous and polygynous mating systems In pipefishes and seahorses males receive the eggs from
the female fertilize them protect them within a pouch and give birth to the offspring Figure 4538 Therefore
the female is able to provide eggs to several males without the burden of carrying the fertilized eggs
