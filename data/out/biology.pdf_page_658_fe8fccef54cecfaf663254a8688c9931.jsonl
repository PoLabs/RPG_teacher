Cercozoa
The Cercozoa are both morphologically and metabolically diverse and include both naked and shelled forms
The Chlorarachniophytes Figure 2320 are photosynthetic having acquired chloroplasts by secondary
endosymbiosis The chloroplast contains a remnant of the chlorophyte endosymbiont nucleus sandwiched
between the two sets of chloroplast membranes Vampyrellids or vampire amoebae as their name suggests
obtain their nutrients by thrusting a pseudopod into the interior of other cells and sucking out their contents

Chromalveolata
Current evidence suggests that species classified as chromalveolates are derived from a common ancestor that
engulfed a photosynthetic red algal cell which itself had already evolved chloroplasts from an endosymbiotic
relationship with a photosynthetic prokaryote Therefore the ancestor of chromalveolates is believed to have
resulted from a secondary endosymbiotic event However some chromalveolates appear to have lost red alga
derived plastid organelles or lack plastid genes altogether Therefore this supergroup should be considered
a hypothesisbased working group that is subject to change Chromalveolates include very important
photosynthetic organisms such as diatoms brown algae and significant disease agents in animals and plants
The chromalveolates can be subdivided into alveolates and stramenopiles
