By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Classify the different types of bones in the skeleton

Explain the role of the different cell types in bone

Explain how bone forms during development
Bone or osseous tissue is a connective tissue that constitutes the endoskeleton It contains specialized cells
and a matrix of mineral salts and collagen fibers
The mineral salts primarily include hydroxyapatite a mineral formed from calcium phosphate Calcification is
the process of deposition of mineral salts on the collagen fiber matrix that crystallizes and hardens the tissue
The process of calcification only occurs in the presence of collagen fibers
The bones of the human skeleton are classified by their shape long bones short bones flat bones sutural
bones sesamoid bones and irregular bones Figure 3816
