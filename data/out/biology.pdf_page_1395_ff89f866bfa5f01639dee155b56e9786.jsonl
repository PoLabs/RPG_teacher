by low annual precipitation of fewer than 30 cm 12 in with little monthly variation and lack of predictability in
rainfall In some cases the annual rainfall can be as low as 2 cm 08 in in subtropical deserts located in central
Australia the Outback and northern Africa
The vegetation and low animal diversity of this biome is closely related to low and unpredictable precipitation
Very dry deserts lack perennial vegetation that lives from one year to the next instead many plants are annuals
that grow quickly and reproduce when rainfall does occur and then die Many other plants in these areas are
characterized by having a number of adaptations that conserve water such as deep roots reduced foliage
and waterstoring stems Figure 4415 Seed plants in the desert produce seeds that can be in dormancy for
extended periods between rains Adaptations in desert animals include nocturnal behavior and burrowing
Figure 4415 To reduce water loss many desert plants have tiny leaves or no leaves at all The leaves of ocotillo
Fouquieria splendens shown here in the Sonora Desert near Gila Bend Arizona appear only after rainfall and then
are shed
Chaparral
The chaparral is also called the scrub forest and is found in California along the Mediterranean Sea and along
the southern coast of Australia Figure 4412 The annual rainfall in this biome ranges from 65 cm to 75 cm
256295 in and the majority of the rain falls in the winter Summers are very dry and many chaparral plants
are dormant during the summertime The chaparral vegetation shown in Figure 4416 is dominated by shrubs
adapted to periodic fires with some plants producing seeds that only germinate after a hot fire The ashes left
behind after a fire are rich in nutrients like nitrogen that fertilize the soil and promote plant regrowth
