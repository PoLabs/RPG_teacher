KEY TERMS
alteration in a body system in response to environmental change
change of the set point in a homeostatic system
ingrowth of an animals exoskeleton that functions as an attachment site for muscles
describes animals with no axis of symmetry in their body pattern
metabolic rate at rest in endothermic animals
microchannel that connects the lacunae and aids diffusion between cells
type of connective tissue with a large amount of ground substance matrix cells called chondrocytes
and some amount of fibers
cell found in cartilage
epithelia made of cells taller than they are wide specialized in absorption
type of tissue made of cells ground substance matrix and fibers
epithelia made of cubeshaped cells specialized in glandular functions
body cavity on the posterior or back portion of an animal includes the cranial and vertebral
cavities
animal incapable of maintaining a relatively constant internal body temperature
animal capable of maintaining a relatively constant internal body temperature
tissue that either lines or covers organs or other tissues
torpor in response to extremely high temperatures and low water availability
type of connective tissue with a high concentration of fibers
plane cutting through an animal separating the individual into front and back portions
animal body shape that is tubular and tapered at both ends
torpor over a long period of time such as a winter
dynamic equilibrium maintaining appropriate body functions
space in cartilage and bone that contains living cells
type of connective tissue with small amounts of cells matrix and fibers
found around blood vessels
component of connective tissue made of both living and nonliving ground substances cells
plane cutting through an animal separating the individual into even right and left sides
feedback to a control mechanism that increases or decreases a stimulus instead of
maintaining it
subunit of compact bone
feedback to a control mechanism that continues the direction of a stimulus
layer of epithelia that appears multilayered but is a simple covering
