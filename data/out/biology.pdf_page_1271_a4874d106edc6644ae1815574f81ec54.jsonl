403  Mammalian Heart and Blood Vessels
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the structure of the heart and explain how cardiac muscle is different from other muscles

Describe the cardiac cycle

Explain the structure of arteries veins and capillaries and how blood flows through the body
The heart is a complex muscle that pumps blood through the three divisions of the circulatory system the
coronary vessels that serve the heart pulmonary heart and lungs and systemic systems of the body as
shown in Figure 4010 Coronary circulation intrinsic to the heart takes blood directly from the main artery aorta
coming from the heart For pulmonary and systemic circulation the heart has to pump blood to the lungs or the
rest of the body respectively In vertebrates the lungs are relatively close to the heart in the thoracic cavity The
shorter distance to pump means that the muscle wall on the right side of the heart is not as thick as the left side
which must have enough pressure to pump blood all the way to your big toe
Figure 4010 The mammalian circulatory system is divided into three circuits the systemic circuit the pulmonary
circuit and the coronary circuit Blood is pumped from veins of the systemic circuit into the right atrium of the
heart then into the right ventricle Blood then enters the pulmonary circuit and is oxygenated by the lungs From
the pulmonary circuit blood reenters the heart through the left atrium From the left ventricle blood reenters the
systemic circuit through the aorta and is distributed to the rest of the body The coronary circuit which provides
blood to the heart is not shown
Which of the following statements about the circulatory system is false
a
Blood in the pulmonary vein is deoxygenated
b
Blood in the inferior vena cava is deoxygenated
c
Blood in the pulmonary artery is deoxygenated
d
Blood in the aorta is oxygenated
Structure of the Heart
The heart muscle is asymmetrical as a result of the distance blood must travel in the pulmonary and systemic
circuits Since the right side of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which
must send blood out to the whole body in the systemic circuit as shown in Figure 4011 In humans the heart is
about the size of a clenched fist it is divided into four chambers two atria and two ventricles There is one atrium
