water which is circulated through the mantle cavity by the actions of the incurrent and excurrent siphons During
water intake by the incurrent siphon food particles are captured by the paired posterior gills ctenidia and then
carried by the movement of cilia forward to the mouth Excretion and osmoregulation are performed by a pair
of nephridia Eyespots and other sensory structures are located along the edge of the mantle in some species
The eyes are especially conspicuous in scallops Figure 2823b Three pairs of connected ganglia regulate
activity of different body structures

One of the functions of the mantle is to secrete the shell Some bivalves like oysters and mussels possess the
unique ability to secrete and deposit a calcareous nacre or mother of pearl around foreign particles that may
enter the mantle cavity This property has been commercially exploited to produce pearls

More than half of molluscan species are in the class Gastropoda stomach foot which includes wellknown
mollusks like snails slugs conchs cowries limpets and whelks Aquatic gastropods include both marine and
freshwater species and all terrestrial mollusks are gastropods Gastropoda includes shellbearing species as
well as species without shells Gastropod bodies are asymmetrical and usually present a coiled shell Figure
2824a Shells may be planospiral like a garden hose wound up commonly seen in garden snails or
conispiral like a spiral staircase commonly seen in marine conches Cowrie shells have a polished surface
because the mantle extends up over the top of the shell as it is secreted
