234  Ecology of Protists
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the role that protists play in the ecosystem

Describe important pathogenic species of protists
Protists function in various ecological niches Whereas some protist species are essential components of the
food chain and generators of biomass others function in the decomposition of organic materials Still other
protists are dangerous human pathogens or causative agents of devastating plant diseases
Primary ProducersFood Sources
Protists are essential sources of food and provide nutrition for many other organisms In some cases as
with zooplankton protists are consumed directly Alternatively photosynthetic protists serve as producers of
nutrition for other organisms Paramecium bursaria and several other species of ciliates are mixotrophic due
to a symbiotic relationship with green algae This is a temporary version of the secondarily endosymbiotic
