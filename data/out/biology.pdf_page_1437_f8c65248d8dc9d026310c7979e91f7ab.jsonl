Overcoming DensityDependent Regulation
Humans are unique in their ability to alter their environment with the conscious purpose of increasing carrying
capacity This ability is a major factor responsible for human population growth and a way of overcoming density
dependent growth regulation Much of this ability is related to human intelligence society and communication
Humans can construct shelter to protect them from the elements and have developed agriculture and
domesticated animals to increase their food supplies In addition humans use language to communicate this
technology to new generations allowing them to improve upon previous accomplishments
Other factors in human population growth are migration and public health Humans originated in Africa but have
since migrated to nearly all inhabitable land on the Earth Public health sanitation and the use of antibiotics and
vaccines have decreased the ability of infectious disease to limit human population growth In the past diseases
such as the bubonic plaque of the fourteenth century killed between 30 and 60 percent of Europes population
and reduced the overall world population by as many as 100 million people Today the threat of infectious
disease while not gone is certainly less severe According to the World Health Organization global death
from infectious disease declined from 164 million in 1993 to 147 million in 1992 To compare to some of the
epidemics of the past the percentage of the worlds population killed between 1993 and 2002 decreased from
030 percent of the worlds population to 024 percent Thus infectious disease influence on human population
growth is becoming less significant
Age Structure Population Growth and Economic Development
The age structure of a population is an important factor in population dynamics Age structure is the proportion
of a population at different age ranges Age structure allows better prediction of population growth plus the
ability to associate this growth with the level of economic development in the region Countries with rapid growth
have a pyramidal shape in their age structure diagrams showing a preponderance of younger individuals
many of whom are of reproductive age or will be soon Figure 4516 This pattern is most often observed in
underdeveloped countries where individuals do not live to old age because of lessthanoptimal living conditions
