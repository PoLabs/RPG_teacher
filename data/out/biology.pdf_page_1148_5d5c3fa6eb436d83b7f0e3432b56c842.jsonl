KEY TERMS
sense of hearing
stiff structure in the cochlea that indirectly anchors auditory receptors
neuron with two processes from the cell body typically in opposite directions
cd unit of measurement of luminous intensity brightness
describes a time cycle about one day in length
whorled structure that contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical
signal
weakly photosensitive chromatic coneshaped neuron in the fovea of the retina that detects bright light
and is used in daytime color vision
transparent layer over the front of the eye that helps focus light waves
region in the center of the retina with a high density of photoreceptors and which is responsible for acute
vision
ending of an afferent neuron that lacks a specialized structure for detection of sensory
stimuli some respond to touch pain or temperature
describes the nonhairy skin found on palms and fingers soles of feet and lips of humans and other
primates
in the olfactory bulb one of the two neural clusters that receives signals from one type of olfactory
receptor
muscular proprioceptive tension receptor that provides the sensory component of the
Golgi tendon reflex
sense of taste
also farsightedness visual defect in which the image focus falls behind the retina thereby making
images in the distance clear but closeup images blurry
also anvil second of the three bones of the middle ear
innermost part of the ear consists of the cochlea and the vestibular system
pigmented circular muscle at the front of the eye that regulates the amount of light entering the eye
sense of body movement
bony hollow structure that is the most internal part of the ear contains the sites of transduction of
auditory and vestibular information
transparent convex structure behind the cornea that helps focus light waves on the retina
also hammer first of the three bones of the middle ear
sensory receptor modified to respond to mechanical disturbance such as being bent touch
pressure motion and sound
also tactile corpuscle encapsulated rapidlyadapting mechanoreceptor in the skin that
responds to light touch
unencapsulated slowlyadapting mechanoreceptor in the skin that responds to touch
