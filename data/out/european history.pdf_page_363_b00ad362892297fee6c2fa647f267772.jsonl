Several German states introduced liberal laws and governments and in 
March the first preparliament in Frankfurt am Main was assembled On 1

system and suffrage differed according to the laws of every state but around 
eightyfive percent of male inhabitants could vote
The social composition of the Frankfurt Assembly was homogenous 
consisting predominantly of middleclass academics officials and liberal 
elites The deputies worked on a liberal constitution and in December a law 
granting basic rights was introduced On 28 March 1849 the Prussian King
