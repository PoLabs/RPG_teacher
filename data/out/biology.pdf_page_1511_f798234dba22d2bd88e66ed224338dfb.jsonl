should note that the loss of a keystone species can lead to ecological disaster Extinction is a normal part of
macroevolution But the accelerated extinction rate translates into the loss of tens of thousands of species within
our lifetimes and it is likely to have dramatic effects on human welfare through the collapse of ecosystems and
in added costs to maintain food production clean air and water and human health
Agriculture began after early huntergatherer societies first settled in one place and heavily modified their
immediate environment This cultural transition has made it difficult for humans to recognize their dependence on
undomesticated living things on the planet Biologists recognize the human species is embedded in ecosystems
and is dependent on them just as every other species on the planet is dependent Technology smooths out the
extremes of existence but ultimately the human species cannot exist without a supportive ecosystem
Human Health
Archeological evidence indicates that humans have been using plants for medicinal uses for thousands of years
A Chinese document from approximately 2800 BC is believed to be the the first written account of herbal
remedies and such references occur throughout the global historical record Contemporary indigenous societies
that live close to the land often retain broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area
Most plants produce secondary plant compounds which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and
other animals that eat them but some of which also work as medication
Modern pharmaceutical science also recognizes the importance of these plant compounds Examples of
significant medicines derived from plant compounds include aspirin codeine digoxin atropine and vincristine
Figure 478 Many medicines were once derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized It is estimated
that at one time 25 percent of modern drugs contained at least one plant extract That number has probably
decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant ingredients are replaced by synthetic versions Antibiotics which
are responsible for extraordinary improvements in health and lifespans in developed countries are compounds
largely derived from fungi and bacteria

is a source of vincristine a drug used in the treatment of lymphomas credit Forest and Kim Starr
In recent years animal venoms and poisons have excited intense research for their medicinal potential By
2007 the FDA had approved five drugs based on animal toxins to treat diseases such as hypertension chronic
pain and diabetes Another five drugs are undergoing clinical trials and at least six drugs are being used in
other countries Other toxins under investigation come from mammals snakes lizards various amphibians fish
snails octopuses and scorpions
Aside from representing billions of dollars in profits these medicines improve peoples lives Pharmaceutical
companies are always looking for new compounds synthesized by living organisms that can function as
medicines It is estimated that 13 of pharmaceutical research and development is spent on natural compounds
and that about 35 percent of new drugs brought to market between 1981 and 2002 were derived from natural
compounds The opportunities for new medications will be reduced in direct proportion to the disappearance of
species
