191  Population Evolution
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Define population genetics and describe how scientists use population genetics in studying population
evolution

Define the HardyWeinberg principle and discuss its importance
People did not understand the mechanisms of inheritance or genetics at the time Charles Darwin and Alfred
Russel Wallace were developing their idea of natural selection This lack of knowledge was a stumbling block
to understanding many aspects of evolution The predominant and incorrect genetic theory of the time
blending inheritance made it difficult to understand how natural selection might operate Darwin and Wallace
were unaware of the Austrian monk Gregor Mendels 1866 publication Experiments in Plant Hybridization
which came out not long after Darwins book On the Origin of Species Scholars rediscovered Mendels
work in the early twentieth century at which time geneticists were rapidly coming to an understanding of the
basics of inheritance Initially the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists
to understand how gradual evolution could occur However over the next few decades scientists integrated
genetics and evolution in what became known as the modern synthesisthe coherent understanding of the
relationship between natural selection and genetics that took shape by the 1940s Generally this concept is
generally accepted today In short the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes such as natural
selection can affect a populations genetic makeup and in turn how this can result in the gradual evolution
of populations and species The theory also connects population change over time microevolution with the
processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters called
macroevolution
Evolution and Flu Vaccines
Every fall the media starts reporting on flu vaccinations and potential outbreaks Scientists health experts
and institutions determine recommendations for different parts of the population predict optimal production
and inoculation schedules create vaccines and set up clinics to provide inoculations You may think of the
annual flu shot as media hype an important health protection or just a briefly uncomfortable prick in your
arm However do you think of it in terms of evolution
The media hype of annual flu shots is scientifically grounded in our understanding of evolution Each year
scientists across the globe strive to predict the flu strains that they anticipate as most widespread and
harmful in the coming year They base this knowledge on how flu strains have evolved over time and over
the past few flu seasons Scientists then work to create the most effective vaccine to combat those selected
strains Pharmaceutical companies produce hundreds of millions of doses in a short period in order to
provide vaccinations to key populations at the optimal time
Because viruses like the flu evolve very quickly especially in evolutionary time this poses quite a
challenge Viruses mutate and replicate at a fast rate so the vaccine developed to protect against last years
flu strain may not provide the protection one needs against the coming years strain Evolution of these
viruses means continued adaptions to ensure survival including adaptations to survive previous vaccines
Population Genetics
Recall that a gene for a particular character may have several alleles or variants that code for different traits
associated with that character For example in the ABO blood type system in humans three alleles determine
the particular bloodtype protein on the surface of red blood cells Each individual in a population of diploid
organisms can only carry two alleles for a particular gene but more than two may be present in the individuals
that comprise the population Mendel followed alleles as they were inherited from parent to offspring In the early
twentieth century biologists in the area of population genetics began to study how selective forces change a
population through changes in allele and genotypic frequencies
