to colonial rule and implicated them in multiethnic empires thus creating 
conditions for the migration of colonial subjects to the imperial centres in the 
century thereafter 
Ironically these tides of global migration emerged alongside the growing 
influence of nationalism as an ideology and of national states as the primary 
form of political organisation As migrants transitioned from one country and 
culture to another they increasingly identified themselves as members of 
diasporic communities with strong ties to their nations of origin At the same 
time regional identitiesfor example of Galicians who moved to Madrid or 
Buenos Aires or of the many Frenchmen from the provinces moving to Paris
continued to play an important role in the broader context of developing 
nationalisms As the national state created new constitutional frameworks that 
reinforced the position of national citizens they also produced a new push

Political Exiles Deportees and Refugees
The increased mobility of Europeans was driven by various factors of 
which economic needs and opportunities infrastructural facilities and legal 
constraints were among the most important But just as important were 
political factors which forced people to migrate such as political activism and 
violent conflict Political exile was ubiquitous in nineteenthcentury Europe 
The phenomenon was at the time generally referred to as emigration in 
most European languagesan etymological legacy of the French Revolution 
when thousands of reactionary noblemen and clergymen known as migrs 
accompanied by their families and servants left France to find refuge in 
neighbouring countries
Typically exile followed revolution and regime change From 1789 
onwards supporters of the previous regime and unsuccessful challengers 
of the powers that be habitually went into exile This continued until the 
Paris Commune and the socialist and anarchist upheavals at the end of the 
century For instance in 1821 many Italian liberals arrived in Spain and 
Portugal where constitutional governments had been installed the previous 
year However the fall of both Iberian regimes in 1823 forced thousands of 
Spanish Portuguese and Italians to find shelter in other parts of Europe 
especially England and France Particularly significant was the Polish Great 
Emigration which began after 1830 and grew further after the 1863 uprising 
against Russian domination Also the panEuropean 1848 revolutionsand 
their suppressionsent thousands of Italians Germans Hungarians Czechs
