matrix space by passing through ATP synthase The current of hydrogen ions powers the catalytic action of ATP
synthase which phosphorylates ADP producing ATP
Electron Transport Chain
The electron transport chain Figure 710 is the last component of aerobic respiration and is the only part of
glucose metabolism that uses atmospheric oxygen Oxygen continuously diffuses into plant tissues typically
through stomata as well as into fungi and bacteria however in animals oxygen enters the body through a
variety of respiratory systems Electron transport is a series of redox reactions that resembles a relay race or
bucket brigade in that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the next to the endpoint of the chain
where the electrons reduce molecular oxygen and along with associated protons produces water There are
four complexes composed of proteins labeled I through IV in Figure 710 and the aggregation of these four
complexes together with associated mobile accessory electron carriers is called the electron transport chain
The electron transport chain is present with multiple copies in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes
and within the plasma membrane of prokaryotes
Figure 710 The electron transport chain is a series of electron transporters embedded in the inner mitochondrial
membrane that shuttles electrons from NADH and FADH2 to molecular oxygen In the process protons are pumped
from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space and oxygen is reduced to form water
Complex I
First two electrons are carried to the first complex via NADH This complex labeled I is composed of flavin
mononucleotide FMN and an ironsulfur FeScontaining protein FMN which is derived from vitamin B2 also
called riboflavin is one of several prosthetic groups or cofactors in the electron transport chain A prosthetic
group is a nonprotein molecule required for the activity of a protein Prosthetic groups are organic or inorganic
nonpeptide molecules bound to a protein that facilitate its function Prosthetic groups include coenzymes which
are the prosthetic groups of enzymes The enzyme in complex I is NADH dehydrogenase and is a very large
protein containing 45 amino acid chains Complex I can pump four hydrogen ions across the membrane from
the matrix into the intermembrane space and it is in this way that the hydrogen ion gradient is established and
maintained between the two compartments separated by the inner mitochondrial membrane
Q and Complex II
Complex II directly receives FADH2which does not pass through complex I The compound connecting the first
and second complexes to the third is ubiquinone B The Q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through
the hydrophobic core of the membrane Once it is reduced QH2 ubiquinone delivers its electrons to the next
complex in the electron transport chain Q receives the electrons derived from NADH from complex I and the
electrons derived from FADH2 from complex II This enzyme and FADH2 form a small complex that delivers
electrons directly to the electron transport chain bypassing the first complex Since these electrons bypass and
thus do not energize the proton pump in the first complex fewer ATP molecules are made from the FADH2
electrons The number of ATP molecules ultimately obtained is directly proportional to the number of protons
pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane
