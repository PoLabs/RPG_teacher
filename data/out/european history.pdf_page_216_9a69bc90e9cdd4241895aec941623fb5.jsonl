Conclusion
After the First World War and the dissolution of former empires national 
ideals informed the selfidentification of new states and continued to define 
the strategies of governing elites throughout the century This development 
encouraged restrictive or assimilative policies towards national or ethnic 
minorities fuelling unresolved tensions and in some cases leading to 
separatist movements The period between the early 1930s and the late 1940s 
irreversibly changed the ethnic maps of entire regions Millions were killed 
or forced to resettle as a result of the Second World War War genocide and 
mass expulsions broke up centuriesold patterns of ethnic coexistence in the 
victims places of origin while the arrival of forced migrants often led to new 
tensions with the local populace in their places of arrival After 1945 Europe 
became a region of mass immigration due to postcolonial global migration 
patterns and the globalisation of the labour market Until 1989 Eastern Bloc 
countriesbeing closed societies under the control of the Soviet Unionstood 
largely outside the circuits of global migration However after the collapse of 
state socialist systems they too became countries of arrival for international 
migrants within an expanding European Union 
The national turn that had taken place in the late nineteenth century thus 
manifested itself in all countries of Europe throughout the twentieth century 
deeply affecting the relationship of majority nations with the minorities living 
among them as well as the relationships between different minority groups 
The ethnically and culturally homogeneous nationstate became the norm and 
the ideal even if that ideal was far removed from the existing realities of most 
European countries and particularly far from the conditions of large multi
ethnic states in early twentiethcentury Europe This was particularly true in 
Central Eastern and southeastern Europe regions whose twentiethcentury 
history exemplifies key problems of interethnic relations Indeed the habit of 
speaking about ethnic groups is far more prevalent in relation to Eastern and 
southeastern Europe than it is to Western Europe though there exist important 
tensions in minoritymajority relations in the latter as well Conflicts over 
ethnic difference are thus not a specific feature of the east and southeast but a 
reflection of the longevity of nationalist thought and its assumption of ethnic 
homogeneity Given the bloodshed and body count of nationalist projects one 
must use national and ethnic categories with care and critical reflection
The most troublesome impact of the national turn has been on minorities 
who have never had their own nationstate within Europe such as Jews the 
Roma and nomads The Jewish response to the experience of being a stateless 
people was often a strong identification with and an effort to integrate into 
the state in which they lived However with rightwing political groups and
