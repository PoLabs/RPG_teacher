Current Species Diversity
Despite considerable effort knowledge of the species that inhabit the planet is limited and always will be
because of a continuing lack of financial resources and political willpower A recent estimate suggests that the
eukaryote species for which science has names about 15 million species account for less than 20 percent of
the total number of eukaryote species present on the planet 87 million species by one estimate Estimates of
numbers of prokaryotic species are largely guesses but biologists agree that science has only begun to catalog
their diversity Even with what is known there is no central repository of names or samples of the described
species therefore there is no way to be sure that the 15 million descriptions is an accurate accounting It is a
best guess based on the opinions of experts in different taxonomic groups Given that Earth is losing species at
an accelerating pace science is very much in the place it was with the Lake Victoria cichlids knowing little about
what is being lost Table 471 presents recent estimates of biodiversity in different groups
