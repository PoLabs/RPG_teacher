catabolism The simple sugars are galactose fructose glycogen and pentose These are catabolized during
glycolysis The amino acids from proteins connect with glucose catabolism through pyruvate acetyl CoA and
components of the citric acid cycle Cholesterol synthesis starts with acetyl groups and the components of
triglycerides come from glycerol3phosphate from glycolysis and acetyl groups produced in the mitochondria
from pyruvate
77 Regulation of Cellular Respiration
Cellular respiration is controlled by a variety of means The entry of glucose into a cell is controlled by the
transport proteins that aid glucose passage through the cell membrane Most of the control of the respiration
processes is accomplished through the control of specific enzymes in the pathways This is a type of negative
feedback mechanism turning the enzymes off The enzymes respond most often to the levels of the available
nucleosides ATP ADP AMP NAD and FAD Other intermediates of the pathway also affect certain enzymes
in the systems
VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS
1 Figure 711 Dinitrophenol DNP is an uncoupler
that makes the inner mitochondrial membrane leaky
to protons It was used until 1938 as a weightloss
drug What effect would you expect DNP to have on
the change in pH across the inner mitochondrial
membrane Why do you think this might be an
effective weightloss drug
2 Figure 712 Cyanide inhibits cytochrome c
oxidase a component of the electron transport chain
If cyanide poisoning occurs would you expect the pH
of the intermembrane space to increase or
decrease What effect would cyanide have on ATP
synthesis
3 Figure 714 Tremetol a metabolic poison found
in the white snake root plant prevents the
metabolism of lactate When cows eat this plant
tremetol is concentrated in the milk they produce
Humans who consume the milk can become
seriously ill Symptoms of this disease which include
vomiting abdominal pain and tremors become
worse after exercise Why do you think this is the
case
