Figure 345 a A gastrovascular cavity has a single opening through which food is ingested and waste is excreted as
shown in this hydra and in this jellyfish medusa b An alimentary canal has two openings a mouth for ingesting food
and an anus for eliminating waste as shown in this nematode
Vertebrate Digestive Systems
Vertebrates have evolved more complex digestive systems to adapt to their dietary needs Some animals have a
single stomach while others have multichambered stomachs Birds have developed a digestive system adapted
to eating unmasticated food
Monogastric Singlechambered Stomach
As the word monogastric suggests this type of digestive system consists of one mono stomach chamber
gastric Humans and many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in Figure 346ab
The process of digestion begins with the mouth and the intake of food The teeth play an important role in
masticating chewing or physically breaking down food into smaller particles The enzymes present in saliva
also begin to chemically breakdown food The esophagus is a long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach
Using peristalsis or wavelike smooth muscle contractions the muscles of the esophagus push the food towards
the stomach In order to speed up the actions of enzymes in the stomach the stomach is an extremely acidic
environment with a pH between 15 and 25 The gastric juices which include enzymes in the stomach act on
the food particles and continue the process of digestion Further breakdown of food takes place in the small
intestine where enzymes produced by the liver the small intestine and the pancreas continue the process of
digestion The nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream across the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small
intestines The waste material travels on to the large intestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste
material is compacted into feces it is stored until it is excreted through the rectum
