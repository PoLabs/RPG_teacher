assemblies were formed amid war in places such as Cdiz Spain and Eidsvoll 
Norway where liberal constitutions were produced in 1812 and 1814
After the first revolutionary wave receded following Napoleons defeat 
and the meeting of the Congress of Vienna 18141815 several panEuropean 
revolutionary movements would return to the continent in 1820 1830 and 
1848
The revolutionary cycle of 1820 was associated with demands of constitutional 
reform by certain sectors of European societiesmostly coming from the 
urban middle classesthat were dissatisfied with the political situation The 
revolution started in Spain in January 1820 where King Ferdinand VII 1784

Berry the Kings nephew The Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich 
17731859 was more alarmed by the threat coming from Italy which directly 
affected Habsburg territories The reactionary powers Austria Russia 
Prussia and France reclaimed for themselves the right to intervene against 
liberal revolutionaries Britain failed to give direct support but consented to 
see constitutional regimes being put down by force Thus by the end of 1823
