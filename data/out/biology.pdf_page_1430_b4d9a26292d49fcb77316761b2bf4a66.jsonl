Figure 4510 a Yeast grown in ideal conditions in a test tube show a classical Sshaped logistic growth curve
whereas b a natural population of seals shows realworld fluctuation
If the major food source of the seals declines due to pollution or overfishing which of the following would
likely occur
a
The carrying capacity of seals would decrease as would the seal population
b
The carrying capacity of seals would decrease but the seal population would remain the same
c
The number of seal deaths would increase but the number of births would also increase so the
population size would remain the same
d
The carrying capacity of seals would remain the same but the population of seals would decrease
