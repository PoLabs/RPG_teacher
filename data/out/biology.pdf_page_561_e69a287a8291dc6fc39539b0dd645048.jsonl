fungal species feeding on yew trees from which the anticancer drug TAXOL is derived from the bark have
acquired the ability to make taxol themselves a clear example of gene transfer
In animals a particularly interesting example of HGT occurs within the aphid species Figure 2013 Aphids
are insects that vary in color based on carotenoid content Carotenoids are pigments that a variety of plants
fungi and microbes produce and they serve a variety of functions in animals who obtain these chemicals from
their food Humans require carotenoids to synthesize vitamin A and we obtain them by eating orange fruits and
vegetables carrots apricots mangoes and sweet potatoes Alternatively aphids have acquired the ability to
make the carotenoids on their own According to DNA analysis this ability is due to fungal genes transferring
into the insect by HGT presumably as the insect consumed fungi for food A carotenoid enzyme or desaturase
is responsible for the red coloration in certain aphids and when mutation activates this gene the aphids revert
to their more common green color Figure 2013
Figure 2013 a Red aphids get their color from red carotenoid pigment Genes necessary to make this pigment are
present in certain fungi and scientists speculate that aphids acquired these genes through HGT after consuming fungi
for food If mutation inactivates the genes for making carotenoids the aphids revert back to b their green color Red
coloration makes the aphids considerably more conspicuous to predators but evidence suggests that red aphids are
more resistant to insecticides than green ones Thus red aphids may be more fit to survive in some environments than
green ones credit a modification of work by Benny Mazur credit b modification of work by Mick Talbot
Genome Fusion and Eukaryote Evolution
Scientists believe the ultimate in HGT occurs through genome fusion between different prokaryote species
when two symbiotic organisms become endosymbiotic This occurs when one species is taken inside another
species cytoplasm which ultimately results in a genome consisting of genes from both the endosymbiont
and the host This mechanism is an aspect of the Endosymbiont Theory which most biologists accept as
the mechanism whereby eukaryotic cells obtained their mitochondria and chloroplasts However the role of
endosymbiosis in developing the nucleus is more controversial Scientists believe that nuclear and mitochondrial
DNA have different separate evolutionary origins with the mitochondrial DNA derived from the bacterias
circular genomes ancient prokaryotic cells engulfed We can regard mitochondrial DNA as the smallest
chromosome Interestingly enough mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother The mitochondrial DNA
degrades in sperm when the sperm degrades in the fertilized egg or in other instances when the mitochondria
located in the sperms flagellum fails to enter the egg
Within the past decade James Lake of the UCLANASA Astrobiology Institute proposed that the genome fusion
process is responsible for the evolution of the first eukaryotic cells Figure 2014a Using DNA analysis and
a new mathematical algorithm conditioned reconstruction CR his laboratory proposed that eukaryotic cells
developed from an endosymbiotic gene fusion between two species one an Archaea and the other a Bacteria
As mentioned some eukaryotic genes resemble those of Archaea whereas others resemble those from
Bacteria An endosymbiotic fusion event such as Lake has proposed would clearly explain this observation
Alternatively this work is new and the CR algorithm is relatively unsubstantiated which causes many scientists
to resist this hypothesis
Lakes more recent work Figure 2014b proposes that gramnegative bacteria which are unique within their
domain in that they contain two lipid bilayer membranes resulted from an endosymbiotic fusion of archaeal and
bacterial species The double membrane would be a direct result of the endosymbiosis with the endosymbiont
picking up the second membrane from the host as it was internalized Scientists have also used this mechanism
to explain the double membranes in mitochondria and chloroplasts Lakes work is not without skepticism and
the biological science community still debates his ideas In addition to Lakes hypothesis there are several other
competing theories as to the origin of eukaryotes How did the eukaryotic nucleus evolve One theory is that the
