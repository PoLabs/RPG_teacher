333  Homeostasis
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Define homeostasis

Describe the factors affecting homeostasis

Discuss positive and negative feedback mechanisms used in homeostasis

Describe thermoregulation of endothermic and ectothermic animals
Animal organs and organ systems constantly adjust to internal and external changes through a process called
homeostasis steady state These changes might be in the level of glucose or calcium in blood or in external
temperatures Homeostasis means to maintain dynamic equilibrium in the body It is dynamic because it is
constantly adjusting to the changes that the bodys systems encounter It is equilibrium because body functions
are kept within specific ranges Even an animal that is apparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic
equilibrium
Homeostatic Process
The goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a set point While
there are normal fluctuations from the set point the bodys systems will usually attempt to go back to this point
A change in the internal or external environment is called a stimulus and is detected by a receptor the response
of the system is to adjust the deviation parameter toward the set point For instance if the body becomes too
warm adjustments are made to cool the animal If the bloods glucose rises after a meal adjustments are made
to lower the blood glucose level by getting the nutrient into tissues that need it or to store it for later use
Control of Homeostasis
When a change occurs in an animals environment an adjustment must be made The receptor senses the
change in the environment then sends a signal to the control center in most cases the brain which in turn
generates a response that is signaled to an effector The effector is a muscle that contracts or relaxes or a
gland that secretes Homeostatsis is maintained by negative feedback loops Positive feedback loops actually
push the organism further out of homeostasis but may be necessary for life to occur Homeostasis is controlled
by the nervous and endocrine system of mammals
Negative Feedback Mechanisms
Any homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a negative feedback loop It may either
increase or decrease the stimulus but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed
it In other words if a level is too high the body does something to bring it down and conversely if a level is
too low the body does something to make it go up Hence the term negative feedback An example is animal
maintenance of blood glucose levels When an animal has eaten blood glucose levels rise This is sensed
by the nervous system Specialized cells in the pancreas sense this and the hormone insulin is released by
the endocrine system Insulin causes blood glucose levels to decrease as would be expected in a negative
feedback system as illustrated in Figure 3320 However if an animal has not eaten and blood glucose levels
decrease this is sensed in another group of cells in the pancreas and the hormone glucagon is released causing
glucose levels to increase This is still a negative feedback loop but not in the direction expected by the use
of the term negative Another example of an increase as a result of the feedback loop is the control of blood
calcium If calcium levels decrease specialized cells in the parathyroid gland sense this and release parathyroid
hormone PTH causing an increased absorption of calcium through the intestines and kidneys and possibly
the breakdown of bone in order to liberate calcium The effects of PTH are to raise blood levels of the element
Negative feedback loops are the predominant mechanism used in homeostasis
