Codominance
A variation on incomplete dominance is codominance in which both alleles for the same characteristic are
simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of humans
The M and N alleles are expressed in the form of an M or N antigen present on the surface of red blood
cells Homozygotes LMLM and LNLN express either the M or the N allele and heterozygotes LMLN express
both alleles equally In a selfcross between heterozygotes expressing a codominant trait the three possible
offspring genotypes are phenotypically distinct However the 121 genotypic ratio characteristic of a Mendelian
monohybrid cross still applies
Multiple Alleles
Mendel implied that only two alleles one dominant and one recessive could exist for a given gene We now
know that this is an oversimplification Although individual humans and all diploid organisms can only have two
alleles for a given gene multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two
alleles are observed Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene the convention is to denote the most
common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type often abbreviated  this is considered
the standard or norm All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard meaning that
they deviate from the wild type The variant may be recessive or dominant to the wildtype allele
An example of multiple alleles is coat color in rabbits Figure 128 Here four alleles exist for the c gene The
wildtype version CC is expressed as brown fur The chinchilla phenotype cchcch is expressed as black
tipped white fur The Himalayan phenotype chch has black fur on the extremities and white fur elsewhere
Finally the albino or colorless phenotype cc is expressed as white fur In cases of multiple alleles dominance
hierarchies can exist In this case the wildtype allele is dominant over all the others chinchilla is incompletely
dominant over Himalayan and albino and Himalayan is dominant over albino This hierarchy or allelic series
was revealed by observing the phenotypes of each possible heterozygote offspring
