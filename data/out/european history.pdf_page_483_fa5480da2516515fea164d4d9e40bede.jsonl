Introduction
The early modern period saw a considerable growth in population Many 
people moved to towns and cities urban poverty increased and rural areas 
also endured impoverishment The onset of industrialisation contributed to 
this trend with large swaths of the population dependent on low wages and 
insecure employment Increasing poverty in turn increased vagrancy and 
begging Authorities tried to contain this development by separating foreign 
poor from those originating from within their own jurisdictions based on the 
principle that poor relief could only be granted to locals The growing number 
of poor and homeless people was seen as a social and political threat As a 
result legislation was introduced that discouraged vagrancy and begging and 
regulated the financing and distribution of poor relief In England a national 
system of poor relief that combined these aims was first created during the 
reign of Elizabeth I Work and schooling were seen as a means of social and 
moral betterment and were often made mandatory in connection with poor 
relief the poor were subjected to policing and correction
The early modern period also saw a tendency to rationalise welfare and 
bring it under lay control although religion remained a strong impetus for 
charitable activities Welfare policies were implemented by individual parishes 
Ecclesiastical and corporate charity operated independently of but still related 
to the authorities own poor relief Early modern welfare measures targeted 
basic needs such as for meals and clothing as well as more complex issues like 
healthcare housing education and care for the elderly orphans and those 
with disabilities The growing complexity of social organisation associated 
with the emergence of a global economic system and protoindustrialisation
