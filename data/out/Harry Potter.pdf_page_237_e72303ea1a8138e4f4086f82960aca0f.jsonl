me that Stone in your pocket
So he knew The feeling suddenly surged back into Harrys legs He
stumbled backward
Dont be a fool snarled the face Better save your own life and join
me or youll meet the same end as your parents They died begging
me for mercy
LIAR Harry shouted suddenly
Quirrell was walking backward at him so that Voldemort could still see
him The evil face was now smiling
How touching it hissed I always value bravery Yes boy your
parents were brave I killed your father first and he put up a
courageous fight but your mother neednt have died she was trying
to protect you Now give me the Stone unless you want her to have
died in vain
NEVER
Harry sprang toward the flame door but Voldemort screamed SEIZE HIM
and the next second Harry felt Quirrells hand close on his wrist At
once a needlesharp pain seared across Harrys scar his head felt as
though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his
might and to his surprise Quirrell let go of him The pain in his head
lessened  he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone and
saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers  they were blistering
before his eyes
Seize him SEIZE HIM shrieked Voldemort again and Quirrell lunged
knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands
around Harrys neck  Harrys scar was almost blinding him with pain
yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony
Master I cannot hold him  my hands  my hands
And Quirrell though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees let go
of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms  Harry could see
they looked burned raw red and shiny
Then kill him fool and be done screeched Voldemort
