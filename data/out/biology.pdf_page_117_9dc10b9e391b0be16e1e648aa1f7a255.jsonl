Introduction
Close your eyes and picture a brick wall What is the walls basic building block It is a single brick Like a brick
wall cells are the building blocks that make up your body
Your body has many kinds of cells each specialized for a specific purpose Just as we use a variety of materials
to build a home the human body is constructed from many cell types For example epithelial cells protect
the bodys surface and cover the organs and body cavities within Bone cells help to support and protect the
body Immune system cells fight invading bacteria Additionally blood and blood cells carry nutrients and oxygen
throughout the body while removing carbon dioxide Each of these cell types plays a vital role during the bodys
growth development and daytoday maintenance In spite of their enormous variety however cells from all
organismseven ones as diverse as bacteria onion and humanshare certain fundamental characteristics
41  Studying Cells
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the role of cells in organisms

Compare and contrast light microscopy and electron microscopy

Summarize cell theory
A cell is the smallest unit of a living thing Whether comprised of one cell like bacteria or many cells like a
human we call it an organism Thus cells are the basic building blocks of all organisms
