Fatal neurodegenerative diseases such as kuru in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE in
cattle commonly known as mad cow disease were shown to be transmitted by prions The disease was
spread by the consumption of meat nervous tissue or internal organs between members of the same species
Kuru native to humans in Papua New Guinea was spread from human to human via ritualistic cannibalism
BSE originally detected in the United Kingdom was spread between cattle by the practice of including cattle
nervous tissue in feed for other cattle Individuals with kuru and BSE show symptoms of loss of motor control
and unusual behaviors such as uncontrolled bursts of laughter with kuru followed by death Kuru was controlled
by inducing the population to abandon its ritualistic cannibalism
On the other hand BSE was initially thought to only affect cattle Cattle dying of the disease were shown to have
developed lesions or holes in the brain causing the brain tissue to resemble a sponge Later on in the outbreak
however it was shown that a similar encephalopathy in humans known as variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease
CJD could be acquired from eating beef from animals infected with BSE sparking bans by various countries
on the importation of British beef and causing considerable economic damage to the British beef industry Figure
2117 BSE still exists in various areas and although a rare disease individuals that acquire CJD are difficult
to treat The disease can be spread from human to human by blood so many countries have banned blood
donation from regions associated with BSE
The cause of spongiform encephalopathies such as kuru and BSE is an infectious structural variant of a normal
cellular protein called PrP prion protein It is this variant that constitutes the prion particle PrP exists in two
forms PrPc the normal form of the protein and PrPsc the infectious form Once introduced into the body the
PrPsc contained within the prion binds to PrPc and converts it to PrPsc This leads to an exponential increase
of the PrPsc protein which aggregates PrPsc is folded abnormally and the resulting conformation shape
is directly responsible for the lesions seen in the brains of infected cattle Thus although not without some
detractors among scientists the prion seems likely to be an entirely new form of infectious agent the first one
found whose transmission is not reliant upon genes made of DNA or RNA
Figure 2117 Mad Cow Disease in humans a Endogenous normal prion protein PrPc is converted into the disease
causing form PrPsc when it encounters this variant form of the protein PrPsc may arise spontaneously in brain tissue
especially if a mutant form of the protein is present or it may occur via the spread of misfolded prions consumed in
food into brain tissue b This prioninfected brain tissue visualized using light microscopy shows the vacuoles that
give it a spongy texture typical of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies credit b modification of work by Dr Al

Viroids
Viroids are plant pathogens small singlestranded circular RNA particles that are much simpler than a virus
They do not have a capsid or outer envelope but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell Viroids
do not however manufacture any proteins and they only produce a single specific RNA molecule Human
diseases caused by viroids have yet to be identified
Viroids are known to infect plants Figure 2118 and are responsible for crop failures and the loss of millions of
dollars in agricultural revenue each year Some of the plants they infect include potatoes cucumbers tomatoes
chrysanthemums avocados and coconut palms
