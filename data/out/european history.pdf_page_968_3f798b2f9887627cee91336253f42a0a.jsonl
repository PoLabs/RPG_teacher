Europeanisation of Memory and Heritage
Recent decades brought efforts to create a collective European memory either 
by endorsing common ways of dealing with a divisive past or by searching 
for a shared European narrative While some interwar intellectuals such as the 
AustrianJapanese politician Richard von CoudenhoveKalergi 18941972 
could still call on the traditions of antiquity Christianity or the Enlightenment 
to champion projects of panEuropean unity the experience of the Second 
World War the Holocaust and decolonisation undermined efforts to ground 
European identity on a resolutely positive story Instead the focus turned to 
the painful points of a difficult past such as colonialism totalitarian regimes 
or forced migrations with the Second World War and the Holocaust conceived 
as the negative founding myth of Europe and the zero point of postwar 
European integration Some historians followed the lieux de mmoire approach 
and completed inventories of the European realms of memory drawing up lists 
of personalities events places or traditions which reflect European myths 
aspirations values or traumas or have shown enduring power to generate 
diverse meanings conflicting appropriations and contradictory views Most 
recently the House of European History a museum created on the initiative of 
the European Parliament which opened in 2017 in Brussels has endeavoured 
to present a shared European history while trying to hold space for diverse 
perspectives and interpretations
The second half of the twentieth century has also witnessed a 
Europeanisation of heritage This entailed the reinterpretation of tangible and 
intangible remnants of the past as having a distinctively European value while 
making heritage a resource that should foster a sense of European identity 
The concept of European heritage was coined by the Council of Europe in 
the European Cultural Convention of 1954 concerning the preservation and 
accessibility of heritage deemed a shared European treasure But the major 
turning point was the crisis of the European integration process in the 1970s 
which gave birth to cultural policies of the European Community later the 
European Union Cultural heritage became an operational term for ongoing 
integration on a cultural basis Over the past four decades these cultural 
policies have manifested in many programmes designed to promote the 
European dimension of cultural heritage such as European Heritage Days 
the European Capital of Culture and more recently the Cultural Routes of 
the Council of Europe and the European Heritage Label which represents a 
counterpart to UNESCOs World Heritage Label
