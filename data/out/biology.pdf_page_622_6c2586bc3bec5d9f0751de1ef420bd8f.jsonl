Figure 2222 Emerging diseases The map shows regions where bacterial diseases are emerging or reemerging
credit modification of work by NIH
Some of the present emerging diseases are not actually new but are diseases that were catastrophic in the past
Figure 2223 They devastated populations and became dormant for a while just to come back sometimes
more virulent than before as was the case with bubonic plague Other diseases like tuberculosis were never
eradicated but were under control in some regions of the world until coming back mostly in urban centers with
high concentrations of immunocompromised people WHO has identified certain diseases whose worldwide re
emergence should be monitored Among these are three viral diseases dengue fever yellow fever and zika
and three bacterial diseases diphtheria cholera and bubonic plague The war against infectious diseases has
no foreseeable end
Figure 2223 Lyme Disease Lyme disease often but not always results in a a characteristic bullseye rash The
disease is caused by a b Gramnegative spirochete bacterium of the genus Borrelia The bacteria c infect ticks
which in turn infect mice Deer are the preferred secondary host but the ticks also may feed on humans Untreated
the disease causes chronic disorders in the nervous system eyes joints and heart The disease is named after
Lyme Connecticut where an outbreak occurred in 1995 and has subsequently spread The disease is not new
however Genetic evidence suggests that tzi the Iceman a 5300yearold mummy found in the Alps was infected

Foodborne Diseases
Prokaryotes are everywhere They readily colonize the surface of any type of material and food is not an
exception Most of the time prokaryotes colonize food and foodprocessing equipment in the form of a biofilm
as we have discussed earlier Outbreaks of bacterial infection related to food consumption are common
A foodborne disease commonly called food poisoning is an illness resulting from the consumption the
pathogenic bacteria viruses or other parasites that contaminate food Although the United States has one of
the safest food supplies in the world the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has reported
