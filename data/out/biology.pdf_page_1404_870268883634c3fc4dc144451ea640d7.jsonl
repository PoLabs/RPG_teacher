also include wetlands which will be discussed later Humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide ecosystem
benefits which are aquatic resources for drinking water crop irrigation sanitation and industry Lakes and ponds
are connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing their terrestrial biomes
Lakes and Ponds
Lakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers Temperature
is an important abiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds In the summer as we have
seen thermal stratification of lakes and ponds occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun
and does not mix with deeper cooler water Light can penetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond
Phytoplankton algae and cyanobacteria are found here and carry out photosynthesis providing the base of
the food web of lakes and ponds Zooplankton such as rotifers and larvae and adult crustaceans consume
these phytoplankton At the bottom of lakes and ponds bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead organisms
that sink to the bottom
Nitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds Because of this they are the
determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth that takes place in lakes and ponds When there is a
large input of nitrogen and phosphorus from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms for example
the growth of algae skyrockets resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom Algal blooms
Figure 4424 can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water They may also release
toxic byproducts into the water contaminating any drinking water taken from that source In addition the lake or
pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic plants cannot survive When the algae die and decompose severe
oxygen depletion of the water occurs Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are then more likely to
die resulting in a dead zone Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent freshwater and marine habitats where
phosphorus control and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges

Rivers and Streams
Rivers and streams are continuously moving bodies of water that carry large amounts of water from the source
or headwater to a lake or ocean The largest rivers include the Nile River in Africa the Amazon River in South
America and the Mississippi River in North America
Abiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream Streams begin at a point of
origin referred to as source water The source water is usually cold low in nutrients and clear The channel
the width of the river or stream is narrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream
Because of this the current is often faster here than at any other point of the river or stream
The fastmoving water results in minimal silt accumulation at the bottom of the river or stream therefore the
water is usually clear and free of debris Photosynthesis here is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on
rocks the swift current inhibits the growth of phytoplankton An additional input of energy can come from leaves
and other organic material that fall downstream into the river or stream as well as from trees and other plants
that border the water When the leaves decompose the organic material and nutrients in the leaves are returned
to the water Plants and animals have adapted to this fastmoving water For instance leeches phylum Annelida
have elongated bodies and suckers on the anterior and ventral areas of the body These suckers attach to
the substrate keeping the leech anchored in place and are also used to attach to their prey Freshwater trout
species phylum Chordata are an important predator in these fastmoving rivers and streams
