Figure 2016 In W Ford Doolittles a phylogenetic model the tree of life arose from a community of ancestral cells
has multiple trunks and has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has occurred Visually this
concept is better represented by b the multitrunked Ficus than by an oaks single trunk similar to Darwins tree in

Ring of Life Models
Others have proposed abandoning any treelike model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure the socalled 
ring of life Figure 2017 This is a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool
of primitive prokaryotes Lake again using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm proposes a ringlike model
in which species of all three domainsArchaea Bacteria and Eukaryaevolved from a single pool of gene
swapping prokaryotes His laboratory proposes that this structure is the best fit for data from extensive DNA
analyses performed in his laboratory and that the ring model is the only one that adequately takes HGT and
genomic fusion into account However other phylogeneticists remain highly skeptical of this model
Figure 2017 According to the ring of life phylogenetic model the three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive
prokaryotes
In summary we must modify Darwins tree of life model to include HGT Does this mean abandoning the
tree model completely Even Lake argues that scientists should attempt to modify the tree model to allow it to
accurately fit his data and only the inability to do so will sway people toward his ring proposal
This doesnt mean a tree web or a ring will correlate completely to an accurate description of phylogenetic
