Figure 3711 Insulin and glucagon regulate blood glucose levels
Pancreatic tumors may cause excess secretion of glucagon Type I diabetes results from the failure of the
pancreas to produce insulin Which of the following statement about these two conditions is true
a
A pancreatic tumor and type I diabetes will have the opposite effects on blood sugar levels
b
A pancreatic tumor and type I diabetes will both cause hyperglycemia
c
A pancreatic tumor and type I diabetes will both cause hypoglycemia
d
Both pancreatic tumors and type I diabetes result in the inability of cells to take up glucose
Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Thyroid Hormones
The basal metabolic rate which is the amount of calories required by the body at rest is determined by
two hormones produced by the thyroid gland thyroxine also known as tetraiodothyronine or T4 and
triiodothyronine also known as T3 These hormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult
brain uterus testes blood cells and spleen They are transported across the plasma membrane of target
cells and bind to receptors on the mitochondria resulting in increased ATP production In the nucleus T3
and T4 activate genes involved in energy production and glucose oxidation This results in increased rates of
metabolism and body heat production which is known as the hormones calorigenic effect
T3 and T4 release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroidstimulating hormone TSH which is
produced by the anterior pituitary TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production
of T3 and T4 from a glycoprotein called thyroglobulin Thyroglobulin is present in the follicles of the thyroid
and is converted into thyroid hormones with the addition of iodine Iodine is formed from iodide ions that are
actively transported into the thyroid follicle from the bloodstream A peroxidase enzyme then attaches the iodine
to the tyrosine amino acid found in thyroglobulin T3 has three iodine ions attached while T4 has four iodine ions
attached T3 and T4 are then released into the bloodstream with T4 being released in much greater amounts
than T3 As T3 is more active than T4 and is responsible for most of the effects of thyroid hormones tissues of
the body convert T4 to T3 by the removal of an iodine ion Most of the released T3 and T4 becomes attached to
transport proteins in the bloodstream and is unable to cross the plasma membrane of cells These proteinbound
molecules are only released when blood levels of the unattached hormone begin to decline In this way a weeks
worth of reserve hormone is maintained in the blood Increased T3 and T4 levels in the blood inhibit the release
of TSH which results in lower T3 and T4 release from the thyroid
The follicular cells of the thyroid require iodides anions of iodine in order to synthesize T3 and T4 Iodides
