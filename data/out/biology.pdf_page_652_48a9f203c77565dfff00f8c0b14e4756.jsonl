Green Algae Chlorophytes and Charophytes
The most abundant group of algae is the green algae The green algae exhibit features similar to those of the
land plants particularly in terms of chloroplast structure In both green algae and plants carbohydrates are
stored in the plastid That this group of protists shared a relatively recent common ancestor with land plants is
well supported The green algae are subdivided into the chlorophytes and the charophytes The charophytes
are the closest living relatives to land plants and resemble them in morphology and reproductive strategies The
familiar Spirogyra is a charophyte Charophytes are common in wet habitats and their presence often signals a
healthy ecosystem
The chlorophytes exhibit great diversity of form and function Chlorophytes primarily inhabit freshwater and damp
soil and are a common component of plankton Chlamydomonas is a simple unicellular chlorophyte with a pear
shaped morphology and two opposing anterior flagella that guide this protist toward light sensed by its eyespot
More complex chlorophyte species exhibit haploid gametes and spores that resemble Chlamydomonas
The chlorophyte Volvox is one of only a few examples of a colonial organism which behaves in some ways like
a collection of individual cells but in other ways like the specialized cells of a multicellular organism Figure
2311 Volvox colonies contain 500 to 60000 cells each with two flagella contained within a hollow spherical
matrix composed of a gelatinous glycoprotein secretion Individual cells in a Volvox colony move in a coordinated
fashion and are interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges Only a few of the cells reproduce to create daughter
colonies an example of basic cell specialization in this organism Daughter colonies are produced with their
flagella on the inside and have to evert as they are released
Figure 2311 Volvox Volvox aureus is a green alga in the supergroup Archaeplastida This species exists as a colony
consisting of cells immersed in a gellike matrix and intertwined with each other via hairlike cytoplasmic extensions

True multicellular organisms such as the sea lettuce Ulva are also represented among the chlorophytes In
addition some chlorophytes exist as large multinucleate single cells Species in the genus Caulerpa exhibit
flattened fernlike foliage and can reach lengths of 3 meters Figure 2312 Caulerpa species undergo nuclear
division but their cells do not complete cytokinesis remaining instead as massive and elaborate single cells
Figure 2312 A multinucleate alga Caulerpa taxifolia is a chlorophyte consisting of a single cell containing potentially
thousands of nuclei credit NOAA An interesting question is how a single cell can produce such complex shapes
