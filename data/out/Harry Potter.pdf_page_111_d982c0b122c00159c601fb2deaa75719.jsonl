Idiot boy snarled Snape clearing the spilled potion away with one
wave of his wand I suppose you added the porcupine quills before
taking the cauldron off the fire
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose
Take him up to the hospital wing Snape spat at Seamus Then he
rounded on Harry and Ron who had been working next to Neville
You  Potter  why didnt you tell him not to add the quills Thought
hed make you look good if he got it wrong did you Thats another
point youve lost for Gryffindor
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue but Ron kicked
him behind their cauldron
Doi push it he muttered Ive heard Snape can turn very nasty
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later Harrys mind
was racing and his spirits were low Hed lost two points for Gryffindor
in his very first week  why did Snape hate him so much Cheer up
said Ron Snapes always taking points off Fred and George Can I come
and meet Hagrid with you
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the
grounds Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the
forbidden forest A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the
front door
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and
several booming barks Then Hagrids voice rang out saying Back Fang
 back
Hagrids big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door
open
Hang on he said Back Fang
He let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous
black boarhound
There was only one room inside Hams and pheasants were hanging from the
ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner
