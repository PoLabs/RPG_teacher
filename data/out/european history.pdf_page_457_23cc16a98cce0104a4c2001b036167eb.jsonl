41 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE

Overall from about 1500 onwards the everyday experience of large 
populations in Europe was increasingly shaped by products of technical 
innovation Printed books were tangible outcomes of these transformations 
The most lasting changes however came from developments that we 
summarise with the term industrialisation
Industrialisation
Economic development in the early modern period which has been termed 
by posterity the period of protoindustrialisation was characterised by the 
proliferation and coexistence of artisans workshops in cities and market 
towns and by the division of labour among small enterprises operating within 
a framework of home industries There were relatively few largescale factories 
or mining enterprises at this point Urbanised settlements made it possible for 
entrepreneur merchants and manufactory owners to supervise the activities of 
nearby rural home producers by distributing raw materials and tools to them 
a process called the Verlagssystem or by setting standards and schedules for 
the deliveries of semimanufactured products and seeing to the marketing of 
finished goods the Kaufsystem The final phase of the production process was 
carried out in the cities and towns where the workshops of major guilds and 
manufactories the socalled protofactories were operating At the same time 
large numbers of the peasantry were hired on a seasonal or parttime basis and 
gradually turned into labourers becoming dependent on an entrepreneurial 
system well before the development of largescale industrial production 
The early modern system of distribution had first appeared in the fourteenth 
century and the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw it adopted by the 
textile industry the system remained in use until well after the onset of the 
industrial revolution
In the early modern age the dominance of smallscale forms of industrial 
activity is clearly shown by the fact that approximately 22 million people were 
employed as artisans in the Holy Roman Empire of whom one million were 
operating on the basis of a distribution system relying on household industries 
compared with the 100000 people working in largescale manufactories or 
in mines Similar proportions and phenomena are discernible in the northern 
Italian weaving industry and in the early industrialisation of France where 
twothirds of industrial production were dependent on smallscale businesses 
In Lancashire commonly regarded as the birthplace of the industrial 
revolution in England just as many people were employed in small workshops 
as in factories This overrepresentation of home industries was largely 
due to low wages and entrepreneurial flexibility Not surprisingly these 
circumstances also account for the belated mechanisation process of industrial 
production in other parts of Europe
