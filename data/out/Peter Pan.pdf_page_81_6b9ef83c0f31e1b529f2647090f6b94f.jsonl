Bad form
The unhappy Hook was as impotent as he was damp and he fell
forward like a cut flower
His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time discipline
instantly relaxed and they broke into a bacchanalian dance which
brought him to his feet at once all traces of human weakness gone
as if a bucket of water had passed over him
Quiet you scugs he cried or Ill cast anchor in you and at
once the din was hushed Are all the children chained so that they
cannot fly away
Ay ay
Then hoist them up
The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold all except
Wendy and ranged in line in front of him For a time he seemed
unconscious of their presence He lolled at his ease humming not
unmelodiously snatches of a rude song and fingering a pack of
cards Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour
to his face
Now then bullies he said briskly six of you walk the plank to
night but I have room for two cabin boys Which of you is it to be
Dont irritate him unnecessarily had been Wendys instructions
in the hold so Tootles stepped forward politely Tootles hated the
idea of signing under such a man but an instinct told him that it
would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person and
though a somewhat silly boy he knew that mothers alone are always
willing to be the buffer All children know this about mothers and
despise them for it but make constant use of it
So Tootles explained prudently You see sir I dont think my
mother would like me to be a pirate Would your mother like you to
be a pirate Slightly
He winked at Slightly who said mournfully I dont think so as
if he wished things had been otherwise Would your mother like
you to be a pirate Twin
I dont think so said the first twin as clever as the others
Nibs would
Stow this gab roared Hook and the spokesmen were dragged
back You boy he said addressing John you look as if you had a
little pluck in you Didst never want to be a pirate my hearty
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths
prep and he was struck by Hooks picking him out
I once thought of calling myself Redhanded Jack he said
diffidently
And a good name too Well call you that here bully if you join
What do you think Michael asked John
What would you call me if I join Michael demanded
Blackbeard Joe
Michael was naturally impressed What do you think John He
wanted John to decide and John wanted him to decide
Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King John inquired
