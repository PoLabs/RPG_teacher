UNIT 5 ECONOMY
648
Consumption in terms of quantities and qualities has been very diverse 
across political and social frontiers but both capitalist and socialist societies 
experienced large transformations that started in the 1950s in Northwestern 
and Central Europe and in the 1960s in Southern and Eastern Europe 
Moreover as we will underline the fall of the communist system has brought 
about a certain convergence in consumption and waste patterns in aggregate 
terms all over Europe while the social structure of consumption has quite 
probably become more unequal
Economic Growth
The twentieth century was a time of rapid growth in Europe In fact the 
difference in terms of income per capita between Europe and the poorest 
countries in the world was larger in 2000 than in 1900 On the other hand 
there was a process of convergence in the second half of the century between 
European countries and the other rich economies USA Canada Australia and 
New Zealand which has been partially attenuated after 2000 In terms of the 
Human Development Index since 1950 there has been a substantial decline in 
the gap between Europe and poor countries
The high growth rates of European economies in the long twentieth century 
reflect both the availability of new sources of energyespecially oil and raw 
materials imported from other continentsand rapid technological progress 
However growth was not continuous Three Kondratiev cycles have been 
identified between the 1890s and the 1990s Kondratiev or Kcycles are 
longterm cycles usually explained in terms of long waves of technological 
innovation 
The first cycle started in the 1890s and had an upswing until the First 
World War a period known in retrospect as the Belle poque The downswing 
of this first cycle coincided with the interwar period and can be divided 
into three stages the postwar crisis the roaring twenties not uniformly 
roaring in economic terms in Europe and the long crisis after 1929 the 
Great Depression European economies grew less in the interwar years than 
the USA and the recovery from the crisis was in many places delayed until 
the late 1940s Political and economic responses to the Great Depression 
refashioned economic policies and institutions in democratic countries under 
the influence of heterodox economists like Keynes and the members of the 
Stockholm School The crisis also triggered the application of the socalled 
fascist third way In the late 1930s and especially after the Second World War 
European governments were deeply influenced both by the American New 
Deal and by the planning techniques applied in the USSR after 1928
