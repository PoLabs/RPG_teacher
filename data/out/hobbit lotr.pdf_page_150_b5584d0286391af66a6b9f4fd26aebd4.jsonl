them they roped them together and left them till the morning Poor dwarves
Bilbo was not badly off now He slipped from his barrel and waded ashore and
then sneaked along to some huts that he could see near the waters edge He no
longer thought twice about picking up a supper uninvited if he got the chance he
had been obliged to do it for so long and he knew now only too well what it was
to be really hungry not merely politely interested in the dainties of a wellfilled
larder Also he had caught a glimpse of a fire through the trees and that appealed
to him with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy
There is no need to tell you much of his adventures that night for now we are
drawing near the end of the eastward journey and coming to the last and greatest
adventure so we must hurry on Of course helped by his magic ring he got on
very well at first but he was given away in the end by his wet footsteps and the
trail of drippings that he left wherever he went or sat and also he began to
snivel and wherever he tried to hide he was found out by the terrific explosions
of his suppressed sneezes Very soon there was a fine commotion in the village
by the riverside but Bilbo escaped into the woods carrying a loaf and a leather
bottle of wine and a pie that did not belong to him The rest of the night he had
to pass wet as he was and far from a fire but the bottle helped him to do that
and he actually dozed a little on some dry leaves even though the year was
getting late and the air was chilly
He woke again with a specially loud sneeze It was already grey morning
and there was a merry racket down by the river They were making up a raft of
barrels and the raftelves would soon be steering it off down the stream to Lake
town Bilbo sneezed again He was no longer dripping but he felt cold all over
He scrambled down as fast as his stiff legs would take him and managed just in
time to get on to the mass of casks without being noticed in the general bustle
Luckily there was no sun at the time to cast an awkward shadow and for a mercy
he did not sneeze again for a good while
There was a mighty pushing of poles The elves that were standing in the
shallow water heaved and shoved The barrels now all lashed together creaked
and fretted
This is a heavy load some grumbled They float too deepsome of these
are never empty If they had come ashore in the daylight we might have had a
look inside they said
No time now cried the raftman Shove off And off they went at last
