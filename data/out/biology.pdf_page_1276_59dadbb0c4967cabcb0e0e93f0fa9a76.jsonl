Figure 4014 The beating of the heart is regulated by an electrical impulse that causes the characteristic reading of an
ECG The signal is initiated at the sinoatrial valve The signal then a spreads to the atria causing them to contract
The signal is b delayed at the atrioventricular node before it is passed on to the c heart apex The delay allows the
atria to relax before the d ventricles contract The final part of the ECG cycle prepares the heart for the next beat

Arteries Veins and Capillaries
The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels Figure 4015
Arteries take blood away from the heart The main artery is the aorta that branches into major arteries that
take blood to different limbs and organs These major arteries include the carotid artery that takes blood to the
brain the brachial arteries that take blood to the arms and the thoracic artery that takes blood to the thorax and
then into the hepatic renal and gastric arteries for the liver kidney and stomach respectively The iliac artery
takes blood to the lower limbs The major arteries diverge into minor arteries and then smaller vessels called
arterioles to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body
