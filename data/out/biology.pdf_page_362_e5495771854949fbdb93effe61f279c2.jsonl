Analyze your data You observe the following plant phenotypes in the F2 generation 2706 tallinflated
930 tallconstricted 888 dwarfinflated and 300 dwarfconstricted Reduce these findings to a ratio and
determine if they are consistent with Mendelian laws
Form a conclusion Were the results close to the expected 9331 phenotypic ratio Do the results support
the prediction What might be observed if far fewer plants were used given that alleles segregate randomly
into gametes Try to imagine growing that many pea plants and consider the potential for experimental
error For instance what would happen if it was extremely windy one day
Epistasis
Mendels studies in pea plants implied that the sum of an individuals phenotype was controlled by genes or as
he called them unit factors such that every characteristic was distinctly and completely controlled by a single
gene In fact single observable characteristics are almost always under the influence of multiple genes each
with two or more alleles acting in unison For example at least eight genes contribute to eye color in humans

In some cases several genes can contribute to aspects of a common phenotype without their gene products
ever directly interacting In the case of organ development for instance genes may be expressed sequentially
with each gene adding to the complexity and specificity of the organ Genes may function in complementary or
synergistic fashions such that two or more genes need to be expressed simultaneously to affect a phenotype
Genes may also oppose each other with one gene modifying the expression of another
In epistasis the interaction between genes is antagonistic such that one gene masks or interferes with the
expression of another Epistasis is a word composed of Greek roots that mean standing upon The alleles
that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking
Often the biochemical basis of epistasis is a gene pathway in which the expression of one gene is dependent on
the function of a gene that precedes or follows it in the pathway
An example of epistasis is pigmentation in mice The wildtype coat color agouti AA is dominant to solid
colored fur aa However a separate gene C is necessary for pigment production A mouse with a recessive c
allele at this locus is unable to produce pigment and is albino regardless of the allele present at locus A Figure
1220 Therefore the genotypes AAcc Aacc and aacc all produce the same albino phenotype A cross between
heterozygotes for both genes AaCc x AaCc would generate offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 9 agouti3 solid
color4 albino Figure 1220 In this case the C gene is epistatic to the A gene
