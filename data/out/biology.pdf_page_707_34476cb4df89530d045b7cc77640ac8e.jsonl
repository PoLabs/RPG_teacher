CHAPTER SUMMARY
241 Characteristics of Fungi
Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that appeared on land more than 450 million years ago but clearly have an
evolutionary history far greater They are heterotrophs and contain neither photosynthetic pigments such as
chlorophyll nor organelles such as chloroplasts Because fungi feed on decaying and dead matter they are
termed saprobes Fungi are important decomposers that release essential elements into the environment
External enzymes called exoenzymes digest nutrients that are absorbed by the body of the fungus which is
called a thallus A thick cell wall made of chitin surrounds the cell Fungi can be unicellular as yeasts or
develop a network of filaments called a mycelium which is often described as mold Most species multiply by
asexual and sexual reproductive cycles and display an alternation of generations In one group of fungi no
sexual cycle has been identified Sexual reproduction involves plasmogamy the fusion of the cytoplasm
followed by karyogamy the fusion of nuclei Following these processes meiosis generates haploid spores
242 Classifications of Fungi
Chytridiomycota chytrids are considered the most ancestral group of fungi They are mostly aquatic and their
gametes are the only fungal cells known to have flagella They reproduce both sexually and asexually the
asexual spores are called zoospores Zygomycota conjugated fungi produce nonseptate hyphae with many
nuclei Their hyphae fuse during sexual reproduction to produce a zygospore in a zygosporangium
Ascomycota sac fungi form spores in sacs called asci during sexual reproduction Asexual reproduction is
their most common form of reproduction In the Basidiomycota club fungi the sexual phase predominates
producing showy fruiting bodies that contain clubshaped basidia within which spores form Most familiar
mushrooms belong to this division Fungi that have no known sexual cycle were originally classified in the form
phylum Deuteromycota but many have been classified by comparative molecular analysis with the
Ascomycota and Basidiomycota Glomeromycota form tight associations called mycorrhizae with the roots of
plants
