65  Enzymes
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the role of enzymes in metabolic pathways

Explain how enzymes function as molecular catalysts

Discuss enzyme regulation by various factors
A substance that helps a chemical reaction to occur is a catalyst and the special molecules that catalyze
biochemical reactions are enzymes Almost all enzymes are proteins comprised of amino acid chains and
they perform the critical task of lowering the activation energies of chemical reactions inside the cell Enzymes
do this by binding to the reactant molecules and holding them in such a way as to make the chemical bond
breaking and bondforming processes take place more readily It is important to remember that enzymes do not
change the reactions G In other words they do not change whether a reaction is exergonic spontaneous or
endergonic This is because they do not change the reactants or products free energy They only reduce the
activation energy required to reach the transition state Figure 615
Figure 615 Enzymes lower the reactions activation energy but do not change the reactions free energy
Enzyme Active Site and Substrate Specificity
The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzymes substrates There may be one or more
substrates depending on the particular chemical reaction In some reactions a singlereactant substrate breaks
down into multiple products In others two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule Two
reactants might also enter a reaction both become modified and leave the reaction as two products The
location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is the enzymes active site This is where the action
happens Since enzymes are proteins there is a unique combination of amino acid residues also side chains
or R groups within the active site Different properties characterize each residue These can be large or small
weakly acidic or basic hydrophilic or hydrophobic positively or negatively charged or neutral The unique
combination of amino acid residues their positions sequences structures and properties creates a very
specific chemical environment within the active site This specific environment is suited to bind albeit briefly
to a specific chemical substrate or substrates Due to this jigsaw puzzlelike match between an enzyme and
its substrates which adapts to find the best fit between the transition state and the active site enzymes are
known for their specificity The best fit results from the shape and the amino acid functional groups attraction to
the substrate There is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate and thus for each chemical reaction
however there is flexibility as well
The fact that active sites are so perfectly suited to provide specific environmental conditions also means that they
are subject to local enviromental influences It is true that increasing the environmental temperature generally
increases reaction rates enzymecatalyzed or otherwise However increasing or decreasing the temperature
