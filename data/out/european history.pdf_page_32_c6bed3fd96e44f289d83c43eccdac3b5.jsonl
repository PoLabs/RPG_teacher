of Iberian cosmographers and historians The consolidation of Spanish rule 
over the Western Mediterranean the Americas and the African and South
Indian coasts and its influence over the Netherlands and Central Europe 
allowed King Philips vassals to reflect on the power of Europe and within 
it the universalist sovereignty of the Monarchy of Spain For the Aragonese 
lawyer Joseph de Sess this continent although in quantity it is smaller than 
the other parts exceeds all of them not only in the multitude of cities and 
places but also in the multitude of people industry nobility science virtue 
strength fear and knowledge of God which are over all the treasures of the 
world According to de Sess the political dominance of the Europeans from 
the distant times of the Greeks and Romans until the Spanish conquered 
America was uncontested and the power of his monarchs traditional enemies 
such as the Ottoman Empire was negligible From this Eurocentric perspective 
the continent was at the height of world power with Spain in a leading role 
Another contemporary Castilian author Balthasar de Vitoria 1619 portrayed 
Europe as the best known of the four parts of the world For this Augustinian 
friar Felix Europa healthy and fertile was the most powerful continent 
because of its monarchs and the influence of the Pope dominating the whole 
world Its creators were its inhabitants its people those of better stature of 
more advanced understanding of more courageous men of more effort and 
of more invincible spirit Others such as the Portuguese author Antnio de 
Sousa de Macedo 1631 were keen to identify their homeland as the crown 
of that human Europe on whose head the Iberian Peninsula was situated For 
Macedo his kingdom of origin supposedly situated by God in the Western 
lands of the continent was the honour of Spain and consequently of the 
whole world
Conclusion
From the beginning of the sixteenth century onwards then the notion of 
Europe as a political and economic reality became more pronounced It acted 
as a geographical theatre of war Already defined in politicalreligious terms 
as a Respublica Christiana the confrontation with the New World helped to 
define it culturally as an entity of its own Despite the intraChristian wars 
a tradition of learning embodied by scholars and learned institutes created 
an entangled network of learning which was called a Republic of Letters and 
grew more pronounced and reflectiveof itself and of its othersin the 
eighteenth century Visually the notion of Europe as a body was shaped 
in a diversity of forms and orientations These expressed different political 
viewpoints about the centres of power but they agreed on the idea of a more 
or less selfcontained entity called Europe
