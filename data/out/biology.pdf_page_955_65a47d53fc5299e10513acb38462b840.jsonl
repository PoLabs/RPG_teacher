trichome
shoot or root apical meristem
modified underground stem that grows horizontally to the soil surface and has nodes and internodes
protective cells covering the tip of the growing root
hairlike structure that is an extension of epidermal cells increases the root surface area and aids in
absorption of water and minerals
belowground portion of the plant that supports the plant and absorbs water and minerals
stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes
plant cell that has thick secondary walls and provides structural support usually dead at
maturity
growth resulting in an increase in thickness or girth caused by the lateral meristem and cork
cambium
leaf without a petiole that is attached directly to the plant stem
aboveground portion of the plant consists of nonreproductive plant parts such as leaves and
stems and reproductive parts such as flowers and fruits
phloem cell arranged end to end to form a sieve tube that transports organic substances such
as sugars and amino acids
leaf type in which the lamina is completely undivided or merely lobed
growing parts of a plant such as roots and young leaves which require photosynthate
organ that produces photosynthate for a plant
also amyloplast plant organelle that contains heavy starch granules
inner portion of the root containing the vascular tissue surrounded by the endodermis
small green structure found on either side of the leaf stalk or petiole
modified stem that runs parallel to the ground and can give rise to new plants at the nodes
hormone that promotes seed germination in some species and inhibits lateral apical development
in the absence of auxins
type of root system with a main root that grows vertically with few lateral roots found in dicots
modified stem consisting of slender twining strands used for support or climbing
developmental response to touch
directional growth of a plant independent of the direction in which contact is applied
directional growth of a plant in response to constant contact
modified stem branch appearing as a sharp outgrowth that protects the plant
xylem cell with thick secondary walls that helps transport water
mass transport of photosynthates from source to sink in vascular plants
loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomata
hairlike structure on the epidermal surface
