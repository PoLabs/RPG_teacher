Snape gave Harry a swift piercing look Harry looked at the floor He
wished Ron would put his wand down
Then a small voice came out of the shadows
Please Professor McGonagall  they were looking for me
Miss Granger
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last
I went looking for the troll because I  I thought I could deal with it
on my own  you know because Ive read all about them
Ron dropped his wand Hermione Granger telling a downright lie to a
teacher If they hadnt found me Id be dead now Harry stuck his wand
up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club They didnt have
time to come and fetch anyone It was about to finish me off when they
arrived
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to them
Well  in that case said Professor McGonagall staring at the
three of them Miss Granger you foolish girl how could you think of
tackling a mountain troll on your own
Hermione hung her head Harry was speechless Hermione was the last
person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending
she had to get them out of trouble It was as if Snape had started
handing out sweets
Miss Granger five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this said
Professor McGonagall Im very disappointed in you If youre not hurt
at all youd better get off to Gryffindor tower Students are finishing
the feast in their houses
Hermione left
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron
Well I still say you were lucky but not many first years could have
