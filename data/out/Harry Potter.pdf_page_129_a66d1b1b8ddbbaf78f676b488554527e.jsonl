They fell backward  Harry slammed the door shut and they ran they
almost flew back down the corridor Filch must have hurried off to look
for them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they

between them and that monster They didnt stop running until they
reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor
Where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their
bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces
Never mind that  pig snout pig snout panted Harry and the
portrait swung forward They scrambled into the common room and
collapsed trembling into armchairs
It was a while before any of them said anything Neville indeed looked
as if hed never speak again
What do they think theyre doing keeping a thing like that locked up
in a school said Ron finally If any dog needs exercise that one
does
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again You
dont use your eyes any of you do you she snapped Didnt you see

The floor Harry suggested I wasnt looking at its feet I was too
busy with its heads
No not the floor It was standing on a trapdoor Its obviously
guarding something
She stood up glaring at them
I hope youre pleased with yourselves We could all have been killed 
or worse expelled Now if you dont mind Im going to bed
Ron stared after her his mouth open
No we dont mind he said Youd think we dragged her along
wouldnt you
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed
