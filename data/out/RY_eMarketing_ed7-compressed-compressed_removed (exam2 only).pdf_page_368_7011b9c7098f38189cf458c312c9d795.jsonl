UNDERSTANDING THE METAVERSE ENVIRONMENT 
We understand the metaverse to be a shared 
collective environment where physical reality 
and a persistent virtual space exists on the 
internet and anyone can step into it with the 
right technologies You can either use virtual 
reality VR goggles that plunges you into the 
new world or it could be augmented reality 
AR which involves overlaying auditory visual 
and sensory information onto the offline world 
 and thereby blurring the lines of reality
Since the metaverse is still in its initial stages 
we cannot comprehend the full extent of its capabilities yet The seven layers that we unpack

The seven layers to the metaverse include experience discovery the creator economy spatial 
computing decentralisation human interface and infrastructure
