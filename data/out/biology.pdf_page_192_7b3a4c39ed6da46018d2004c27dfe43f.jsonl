burning process supplying the activation energy for surrounding fuel molecules Like these reactions outside of
cells the activation energy for most cellular reactions is too high for heat energy to overcome at efficient rates In
other words in order for important cellular reactions to occur at appreciable rates number of reactions per unit
time their activation energies must be lowered Figure 610 Scientist refer to this as catalysis This is a very
good thing as far as living cells are concerned Important macromolecules such as proteins DNA and RNA
store considerable energy and their breakdown is exergonic If cellular temperatures alone provided enough
heat energy for these exergonic reactions to overcome their activation barriers the cells essential components
would disintegrate
Figure 610 Activation energy is the energy required for a reaction to proceed and it is lower if the reaction is
catalyzed This diagrams horizontal axis describes the sequence of events in time
If no activation energy were required to break down sucrose table sugar would you be able to store it in a
sugar bowl
63  The Laws of Thermodynamics
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the concept of entropy

Explain the first and second laws of thermodynamics
Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter The matter and its
environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system and everything outside
that system is the surroundings For instance when heating a pot of water on the stove the system includes the
stove the pot and the water Energy transfers within the system between the stove pot and water There are
two types of systems open and closed An open system is one in which energy can transfer between the system
and its surroundings The stovetop system is open because it can lose heat into the air A closed system is one
that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings
Biological organisms are open systems Energy exchanges between them and their surroundings as they
consume energystoring molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work Like all things in the
physical world energy is subject to the laws of physics The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of
energy in and among all systems in the universe
