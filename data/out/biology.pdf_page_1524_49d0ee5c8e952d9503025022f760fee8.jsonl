between them so that individuals and their genes can move between the preserves for example along rivers
and streams will make the smaller preserves behave more like a large one All of these factors are taken into
consideration when planning the nature of a preserve before the land is set aside
In addition to the physical biological and ecological specifications of a preserve there are a variety of policy
legislative and enforcement specifications related to uses of the preserve for functions other than protection
of species These can include anything from timber extraction mineral extraction regulated hunting human
habitation and nondestructive human recreation Many of these policy decisions are made based on political
pressures rather than conservation considerations In some cases wildlife protection policies have been so
strict that subsistenceliving indigenous populations have been forced from ancestral lands that fell within a
preserve In other cases even if a preserve is designed to protect wildlife if the protections are not or cannot be
enforced the preserve status will have little meaning in the face of illegal poaching and timber extraction This is
a widespread problem with preserves in areas of the tropics
Limitations on Preserves
Some of the limitations on preserves as conservation tools are evident from the discussion of preserve design
Political and economic pressures typically make preserves smaller rather than larger so setting aside areas that
are large enough is difficult If the area set aside is sufficiently large there may not be sufficient area to create
a buffer around the preserve In this case an area on the outer edges of the preserve inevitably becomes a
riskier suboptimal habitat for the species in the preserve Enforcement of protections is also a significant issue
in countries without the resources or political will to prevent poaching and illegal resource extraction
Climate change will create inevitable problems with the location of preserves The species within them may
migrate to higher latitudes as the habitat of the preserve becomes less favorable Scientists are planning for the
effects of global warming on future preserves and striving to predict the need for new preserves to accommodate
anticipated changes to habitats however the end effectiveness is tenuous since these efforts are prediction
based
Finally an argument can be made that conservation preserves indicate that humans are growing more separate
from nature and that humans only operate in ways that do damage to biodiversity Creating preserves may
reduce the pressure on humans outside the preserve to be sustainable and nondamaging to biodiversity On
the other hand properly managed high quality preserves present opportunities for humans to witness nature
in a less damaging way and preserves may present some financial benefits to local economies Ultimately the
economic and demographic pressures on biodiversity are unlikely to be mitigated by preserves alone In order
to fully benefit from biodiversity humans will need to alter activities that damage it

Habitat Restoration
Habitat restoration holds considerable promise as a mechanism for restoring and maintaining biodiversity Of
course once a species has become extinct its restoration is impossible However restoration can improve
the biodiversity of degraded ecosystems Reintroducing wolves a top predator to Yellowstone National Park
in 1995 led to dramatic changes in the ecosystem that increased biodiversity The wolves Figure 4717
function to suppress elk and coyote populations and provide more abundant resources to the guild of carrion
eaters Reducing elk populations has allowed revegetation of riparian areas which has increased the diversity
of species in that habitat Decreasing the coyote population has increased the populations of species that
were previously suppressed by this predator The number of species of carrion eaters has increased because
of the predatory activities of the wolves In this habitat the wolf is a keystone species meaning a species
that is instrumental in maintaining diversity in an ecosystem Removing a keystone species from an ecological
community may cause a collapse in diversity The results from the Yellowstone experiment suggest that restoring
a keystone species can have the effect of restoring biodiversity in the community Ecologists have argued for the
