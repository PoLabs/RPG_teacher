vertebral column
bone located on the medial aspect pinkyfinger side of the forearm
also spine surrounds and protects the spinal cord supports the head and acts as an
attachment point for ribs and muscles of the back and neck
CHAPTER SUMMARY
381 Types of Skeletal Systems
The three types of skeleton designs are hydrostatic skeletons exoskeletons and endoskeletons A hydrostatic
skeleton is formed by a fluidfilled compartment held under hydrostatic pressure movement is created by the
muscles producing pressure on the fluid An exoskeleton is a hard external skeleton that protects the outer
surface of an organism and enables movement through muscles attached on the inside An endoskeleton is an
internal skeleton composed of hard mineralized tissue that also enables movement by attachment to muscles
The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that is composed of the axial and appendicular skeleton The axial
skeleton is composed of the bones of the skull ossicles of the ear hyoid bone vertebral column and ribcage
The skull consists of eight cranial bones and 14 facial bones Six bones make up the ossicles of the middle ear
while the hyoid bone is located in the neck under the mandible The vertebral column contains 26 bones and it
surrounds and protects the spinal cord The thoracic cage consists of the sternum ribs thoracic vertebrae and
costal cartilages The appendicular skeleton is made up of the limbs of the upper and lower limbs The pectoral
girdle is composed of the clavicles and the scapulae The upper limb contains 30 bones in the arm the
forearm and the hand The pelvic girdle attaches the lower limbs to the axial skeleton The lower limb includes
the bones of the thigh the leg and the foot
382 Bone
Bone or osseous tissue is connective tissue that includes specialized cells mineral salts and collagen fibers
The human skeleton can be divided into long bones short bones flat bones and irregular bones Compact
bone tissue is composed of osteons and forms the external layer of all bones Spongy bone tissue is composed
of trabeculae and forms the inner part of all bones Four types of cells compose bony tissue osteocytes
osteoclasts osteoprogenitor cells and osteoblasts Ossification is the process of bone formation by
osteoblasts Intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes
Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage Long bones lengthen as
chondrocytes divide and secrete hyaline cartilage Osteoblasts replace cartilage with bone Appositional growth
is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bone tissue at the surface of bones Bone
remodeling involves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts Bone
repair occurs in four stages and can take several months
383 Joints and Skeletal Movement
The structural classification of joints divides them into bony fibrous cartilaginous and synovial joints The
bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue the three types of fibrous joints are
sutures syndesomes and gomphoses Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by
cartilage the two types of cartilaginous joints are synchondroses and symphyses Synovial joints are joints that
have a space between the adjoining bones The functional classification divides joints into three categories
synarthroses amphiarthroses and diarthroses The movement of synovial joints can be classified as one of
four different types gliding angular rotational or special movement Gliding movements occur as relatively flat
bone surfaces move past each other Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of
a joint changes Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its own longitudinal axis
Special movements include inversion eversion protraction retraction elevation depression dorsiflexion
plantar flexion supination pronation and opposition Synovial joints are also classified into six different
categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint planar hinge pivot condyloid saddle and ball
andsocket
384 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion
The body contains three types of muscle tissue skeletal muscle cardiac muscle and smooth muscle Skeleton
muscle tissue is composed of sarcomeres the functional units of muscle tissue Muscle contraction occurs
when sarcomeres shorten as thick and thin filaments slide past each other which is called the sliding filament
model of muscle contraction ATP provides the energy for crossbridge formation and filament sliding
