Next comes Nibs the gay and debonair followed by Slightly who
cuts whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own
tunes Slightly is the most conceited of the boys He thinks he
remembers the days before he was lost with their manners and
customs and this has given his nose an offensive tilt Curly is fourth
he is a pickle and so often has he had to deliver up his person when
Peter said sternly Stand forth the one who did this thing that now
at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it
or not Last come the Twins who cannot be described because we
should be sure to be describing the wrong one Peter never quite
knew what twins were and his band were not allowed to know
anything he did not know so these two were always vague about
themselves and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close
together in an apologetic sort of way
The boys vanish in the gloom and after a pause but not a long
