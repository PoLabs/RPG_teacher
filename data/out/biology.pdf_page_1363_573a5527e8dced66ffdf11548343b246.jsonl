Reproductive Endocrinologist
A reproductive endocrinologist is a physician who treats a variety of hormonal disorders related to
reproduction and infertility in both men and women The disorders include menstrual problems infertility
pregnancy loss sexual dysfunction and menopause Doctors may use fertility drugs surgery or assisted
reproductive techniques ART in their therapy ART involves the use of procedures to manipulate the egg
or sperm to facilitate reproduction such as in vitro fertilization
Reproductive endocrinologists undergo extensive medical training first in a fouryear residency in obstetrics
and gynecology then in a threeyear fellowship in reproductive endocrinology To be board certified in this
area the physician must pass written and oral exams in both areas
435  Human Pregnancy and Birth
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain fetal development during the three trimesters of gestation

Describe labor and delivery

Compare the efficacy and duration of various types of contraception

Discuss causes of infertility and the therapeutic options available
Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual The length
of time of gestation varies among animals but is very similar among the great apes human gestation is 266
days while chimpanzee gestation is 237 days a gorillas is 257 days and orangutan gestation is 260 days long
The fox has a 57day gestation Dogs and cats have similar gestations averaging 60 days The longest gestation
for a land mammal is an African elephant at 640 days The longest gestations among marine mammals are the
beluga and sperm whales at 460 days
Human Gestation
Twentyfour hours before fertilization the egg has finished meiosis and becomes a mature oocyte When
fertilized at conception the egg becomes known as a zygote The zygote travels through the oviduct to the
uterus Figure 4318 The developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days or
it will deteriorate and die The outer layers of the zygote blastocyst grow into the endometrium by digesting
the endometrial cells and wound healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue Another
layer of the blastocyst the chorion begins releasing a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin
HCG which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active This ensures adequate
levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo
Pregnancy tests determine the level of HCG in urine or serum If the hormone is present the test is positive
