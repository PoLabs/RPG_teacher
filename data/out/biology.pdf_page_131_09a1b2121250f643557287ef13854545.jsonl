Endosymbiosis
We have mentioned that both mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA and ribosomes Have you
wondered why Strong evidence points to endosymbiosis as the explanation
Symbiosis is a relationship in which organisms from two separate species depend on each other for their
survival Endosymbiosis endo  within is a mutually beneficial relationship in which one organism lives
inside the other Endosymbiotic relationships abound in nature We have already mentioned that microbes
that produce vitamin K live inside the human gut This relationship is beneficial for us because we are
unable to synthesize vitamin K It is also beneficial for the microbes because they are protected from other
organisms and from drying out and they receive abundant food from the environment of the large intestine
Scientists have long noticed that bacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts are similar in size We also know
that bacteria have DNA and ribosomes just like mitochondria and chloroplasts Scientists believe that host
cells and bacteria formed an endosymbiotic relationship when the host cells ingested both aerobic and
autotrophic bacteria cyanobacteria but did not destroy them Through many millions of years of evolution
these ingested bacteria became more specialized in their functions with the aerobic bacteria becoming
mitochondria and the autotrophic bacteria becoming chloroplasts
The Central Vacuole
Previously we mentioned vacuoles as essential components of plant cells If you look at Figure 48b you will
see that plant cells each have a large central vacuole that occupies most of the cells area The central vacuole
plays a key role in regulating the cells concentration of water in changing environmental conditions Have you
ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days it wilts Thats because as the water concentration
in the soil becomes lower than the water concentration in the plant water moves out of the central vacuoles and
cytoplasm As the central vacuole shrinks it leaves the cell wall unsupported This loss of support to the plants
cell walls results in the wilted appearance
The central vacuole also supports the cells expansion When the central vacuole holds more water the cell
becomes larger without having to invest considerable energy in synthesizing new cytoplasm
44  The Endomembrane System and Proteins
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

List the components of the endomembrane system

Recognize the relationship between the endomembrane system and its functions
The endomembrane system endo  within is a group of membranes and organelles Figure 418 in
eukaryotic cells that works together to modify package and transport lipids and proteins It includes the nuclear
envelope lysosomes and vesicles which we have already mentioned and the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi
apparatus which we will cover shortly Although not technically within the cell the plasma membrane is included
in the endomembrane system because as you will see it interacts with the other endomembranous organelles
The endomembrane system does not include either mitochondria or chloroplast membranes
