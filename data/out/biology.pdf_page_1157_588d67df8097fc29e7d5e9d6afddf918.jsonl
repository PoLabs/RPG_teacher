Figure 373 a The hormone epinephrine which triggers the fightorflight response is derived from the amino acid
tyrosine b The hormone melatonin which regulates circadian rhythms is derived from the amino acid tryptophan
Peptide Hormones
The structure of peptide hormones is that of a polypeptide chain chain of amino acids The peptide hormones
include molecules that are short polypeptide chains such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in
the brain and released into the blood in the posterior pituitary gland This class also includes small proteins
like growth hormones produced by the pituitary and large glycoproteins such as folliclestimulating hormone
produced by the pituitary Figure 374 illustrates these peptide hormones
Secreted peptides like insulin are stored within vesicles in the cells that synthesize them They are then
released in response to stimuli such as high blood glucose levels in the case of insulin Amino acidderived and
polypeptide hormones are watersoluble and insoluble in lipids These hormones cannot pass through plasma
membranes of cells therefore their receptors are found on the surface of the target cells
Figure 374 The structures of peptide hormones a oxytocin b growth hormone and c folliclestimulating hormone
are shown These peptide hormones are much larger than those derived from cholesterol or amino acids
