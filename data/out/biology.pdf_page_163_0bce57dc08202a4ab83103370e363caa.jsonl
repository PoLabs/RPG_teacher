Figure 58 Diffusion through a permeable membrane moves a substance from a high concentration area extracellular
fluid in this case down its concentration gradient into the cytoplasm credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz

Each separate substance in a medium such as the extracellular fluid has its own concentration gradient
independent of other materials concentration gradients In addition each substance will diffuse according to that
gradient Within a system there will be different diffusion rates of various substances in the medium
Factors That Affect Diffusion
Molecules move constantly in a random manner at a rate that depends on their mass their environment and
the amount of thermal energy they possess which in turn is a function of temperature This movement accounts
for molecule diffusion through whatever medium in which they are localized A substance moves into any space
available to it until it evenly distributes itself throughout After a substance has diffused completely through a
space removing its concentration gradient molecules will still move around in the space but there will be no net
movement of the number of molecules from one area to another We call this lack of a concentration gradient in
which the substance has no net movement dynamic equilibrium While diffusion will go forward in the presence
of a substances concentration gradient several factors affect the diffusion rate

Extent of the concentration gradient The greater the difference in concentration the more rapid the
diffusion The closer the distribution of the material gets to equilibrium the slower the diffusion rate

Mass of the molecules diffusing Heavier molecules move more slowly therefore they diffuse more slowly
The reverse is true for lighter molecules

Temperature Higher temperatures increase the energy and therefore the molecules movement increasing
the diffusion rate Lower temperatures decrease the molecules energy thus decreasing the diffusion rate

Solvent density As the density of a solvent increases the diffusion rate decreases The molecules slow
down because they have a more difficult time passing through the denser medium If the medium is less
dense diffusion increases Because cells primarily use diffusion to move materials within the cytoplasm
any increase in the cytoplasms density will inhibit the movement of the materials An example of this
is a person experiencing dehydration As the bodys cells lose water the diffusion rate decreases in the
cytoplasm and the cells functions deteriorate Neurons tend to be very sensitive to this effect Dehydration
frequently leads to unconsciousness and possibly coma because of the decrease in diffusion rate within the
cells

Solubility As we discussed earlier nonpolar or lipidsoluble materials pass through plasma membranes
more easily than polar materials allowing a faster diffusion rate

Surface area and plasma membrane thickness Increased surface area increases the diffusion rate
whereas a thicker membrane reduces it

Distance travelled The greater the distance that a substance must travel the slower the diffusion rate This
places an upper limitation on cell size A large spherical cell will die because nutrients or waste cannot
reach or leave the cells center respectively Therefore cells must either be small in size as in the case of
many prokaryotes or be flattened as with many singlecelled eukaryotes
A variation of diffusion is the process of filtration In filtration material moves according to its concentration
