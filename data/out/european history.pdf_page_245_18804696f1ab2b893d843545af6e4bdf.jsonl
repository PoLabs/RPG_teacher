question
Birth control and abortion were among the main demands of second
wave feminist movements which had been notably influenced by Simone de 
Beauvoirs essay The Second Sex 1949 Even though birth control in the form 
of the pill first trialled in 1956 gradually liberated women from the fear 
of unwanted pregnancies abortion rights were often only granted after years 
of struggle in different countries across Europe as early as 1967 in Britain 
and as late as 2018 in Ireland Poland which had authorised abortion in 1956 
following the example of the USSR has since drastically limited its use 
introducing stringent legislation since 2016 to essentially outlaw it in nearly all 
cases Since the 1990s Assisted Reproductive Technology that was developed 
to tackle infertility has become a subject of public debate especially when 
samesex couples are concerned
In fact achieving visibility and the recognition of rights for LGBTQ

declaring themselves as LGBTfree zones When the LGBT community 
was struck by AIDS new demands emerged in favour of recognising same
sex relationships through civil unions the first of which were established in 
Denmark in 1989 and later samesex marriage starting with the Netherlands 
in 2001 The World Health Organization ceased to regard homosexuality as a 
mental disease in 1990 and did the same for trans identity in 2019 Even though
