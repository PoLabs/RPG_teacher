syndrome a condition characterized by excruciating muscle pain vomiting increased heart rate and psychological
symptoms Two people in Australia where Irukandji jellies are most commonly found are believed to have died from

Class Hydrozoa
Hydrozoa is a diverse group that includes nearly 3200 species most are marine although some freshwater
species are known Figure 2812 Most species exhibit both polypoid and medusoid forms in their lifecycles
although the familiar Hydra has only the polyp form The medusoid form has a muscular veil or velum below
the margin of the bell and for this reason is called a hydromedusa In contrast the medusoid form of Scyphozoa
lacks a velum and is termed a scyphomedusa
The polyp form in these animals often shows a cylindrical morphology with a central gastrovascular cavity lined
by the gastrodermis The gastrodermis and epidermis have a simple layer of mesoglea sandwiched between
them A mouth opening surrounded by tentacles is present at the oral end of the animal Many hydrozoans
form sessile branched colonies of specialized polyps that share a common branching gastrovascular cavity
coenosarc such as is found in the colonial hydroid Obelia
Freefloating colonial species called siphonophores contain both medusoid and polypoid individuals that are
specialized for feeding defense or reproduction The distinctive rainbowhued float of the Portuguese man o
war Physalia physalis creates a pneumatophore with which it regulates buoyancy by filling and expelling carbon
monoxide gas At first glance these complex superorganisms appear to be a single organism but the reality is
that even the tentacles are actually composed of zooids laden with nematocysts Thus although it superficially
resembles a typical medusozoan jellyfish P physalis is a freefloating hydrozoan colony each specimen is made
up of many hundreds of organisms each specialized for a certain function including motility and buoyancy
feeding reproduction and defense Although they are carnivorous and feed on many soft bodied marine animals
P physalis lack stomachs and instead have specialized polyps called gastrozooids that they use to digest their
prey in the open water
Physalia has male and female colonies which release their gametes into the water The zygote develops into
a single individual which then buds asexually to form a new colony Siphonophores include the largest known
floating cnidarian colonies such as Praya dubia whose chain of zoids can get up to 50 meters 165 feet long
Other hydrozoan species are solitary polyps Hydra or solitary hydromedusae Gonionemus One defining
characteristic shared by the hydrozoans is that their gonads are derived from epidermal tissue whereas in all
other cnidarians they are derived from gastrodermal tissue
