2
Helicase opens up the DNAforming replication forks these are extended bidirectionally
3
Singlestrand binding proteins coat the DNA around the replication fork to prevent rewinding of the DNA
4
Topoisomerase binds at the region ahead of the replication fork to prevent supercoiling
5
Primase synthesizes RNA primers complementary to the DNA strand
6
DNA polymerase III starts adding nucleotides to the 3OH end of the primer
7
Elongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues
8
RNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity
9
Gaps are filled by DNA pol I by adding dNTPs
10
The gap between the two DNA fragments is sealed by DNA ligase which helps in the formation of
phosphodiester bonds
Table 141 summarizes the enzymes involved in prokaryotic DNA replication and the functions of each
Prokaryotic DNA Replication Enzymes and Their Function
Enzymeprotein
Specific Function
DNA pol I
Removes RNA primer and replaces it with newly synthesized DNA
DNA pol III
Main enzyme that adds nucleotides in the 53 direction
Helicase
Opens the DNA helix by breaking hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous
bases
Ligase
Seals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments to create one continuous DNA
strand
Primase
Synthesizes RNA primers needed to start replication
Sliding Clamp
Helps to hold the DNA polymerase in place when nucleotides are being added
Topoisomerase
Helps relieve the strain on DNA when unwinding by causing breaks and then
resealing the DNA
Singlestrand binding
proteins SSB
Binds to singlestranded DNA to prevent DNA from rewinding back
