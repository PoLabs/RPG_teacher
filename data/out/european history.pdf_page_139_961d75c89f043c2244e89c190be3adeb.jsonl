Introduction
The twentieth century saw both the heyday and decline of European dominance 
across the globe At the beginning of the century European empires joined 
by the United States and Japan controlled nearly eightyfive percent of the 
worlds land mass but after two devastating global wars in the space of a 
few decades many of the societies that had been subjugated by these empires 
became independent The rise of a bipolar world order after 1945 replaced 
many of the old colonial linkages but justifications for decades of European 
expansionism did not entirely disappear during the course of the century What 
endured was the idea of civilisation the positivist and hierarchical system of 
international law and various processes of othering that had unfolded at least 
since the 1770s European societies continued to cling to their own systems of 
truth and narrative considering their supremacy almost natural and a product 
of innate qualities To justify this narrative in the twentieth century Europeans 
created as in previous centuries longlasting ideational structures in relation 
to other communities and polities of the world
Africa
During the twentieth century the relationship between the European self and 
the African other does not appear to have significantly changed from that
