CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
18 Why is excretion important in order to achieve
osmotic balance
19 Why do electrolyte ions move across membranes
by active transport
20 Why are the loop of Henle and vasa recta
important for the formation of concentrated urine
21 Describe the structure of the kidney
22 Why might specialized organs have evolved for
excretion of wastes
23 Explain two different excretory systems other
than the kidneys
24 In terms of evolution why might the urea cycle
have evolved in organisms
25 Compare and contrast the formation of urea and
uric acid
26 Describe how hormones regulate blood pressure
blood volume and kidney function
27 How does the reninangiotensinaldosterone
mechanism function Why is it controlled by the
kidneys
