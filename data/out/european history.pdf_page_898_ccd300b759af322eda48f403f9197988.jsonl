In line with this approach the Italian Fascist regime 19221943 ruled by 
Benito Mussolini sought to erect a fascist national culture Some artists such 
as the poet Filippo Marinetti or Gabriele DAnnunzio provided the building 
blocks for a new art inspired by violence war and aggressive nationalism 
Under this approach all artistic creation was meant be in tune with the 
new regime andbecause of thatMussolini ordered the confiscation of 
newspapers and books that criticised the regime The Ufficio Stampa della 
Presidenza del Consiglio was the institutional body in charge of controlling 
literary production Moreover the Italian Academy compiled a list of books 
which they believed should be banned and in 1939 a purging policy was set 
in motion which prohibited more than 900 texts 
A similar process took place with the Third Reichs Black List under the 
Nazi regime 19331945 and towards the end of 1938 the number of banned 
books in Germany rose to 4700 including texts written by Bertolt Brecht 
Emil Ludwig and Oskar Maria Graf In order to ensure this prohibition was 
effective combat committees were formed and assigned the task of registering 
private bookshops or commercial libraries and confiscating thousands of texts 
to be destroyed and burnt The ritual of a public burning incited terror in the 
spectator but also a shared sense of belonging to a symbolic community This 
type of public ceremony was carried out from the early years of the rise of 
Nazism On 10 May 1933 thousands of books were burned in Berlins Opera 
Square in the presence of a large number of students who emitted cheers each 
time a book was thrown on to the flames
