Figure 83 The energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain The
predator that eats these deer receives a portion of the energy that originated in the photosynthetic vegetation that the
deer consumed credit modification of work by Steve VanRiper US Fish and Wildlife Service
Main Structures and Summary of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is a multistep process that requires specific wavelengths of visible sunlight carbon dioxide
which is low in energy and water as substrates Figure 84 After the process is complete it releases oxygen
and produces glyceraldehyde3phosphate GA3P as well as simple carbohydrate molecules high in energy
that can then be converted into glucose sucrose or any of dozens of other sugar molecules These sugar
molecules contain energy and the energized carbon that all living things need to survive
Figure 84 Photosynthesis uses solar energy carbon dioxide and water to produce energystoring carbohydrates
Oxygen is generated as a waste product of photosynthesis
The following is the chemical equation for photosynthesis Figure 85
