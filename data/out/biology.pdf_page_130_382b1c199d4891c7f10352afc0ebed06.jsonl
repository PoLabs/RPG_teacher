Chloroplasts
Like the mitochondria chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes but chloroplasts have an entirely
different function Chloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the
series of reactions that use carbon dioxide water and light energy to make glucose and oxygen This is a major
difference between plants and animals Plants autotrophs are able to make their own food like sugars while
animals heterotrophs must ingest their food
Like mitochondria chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes but within the space enclosed by a
chloroplasts inner membrane is a set of interconnected and stacked fluidfilled membrane sacs we call
thylakoids Figure 417 Each thylakoid stack is a granum plural  grana We call the fluid enclosed by the
inner membrane that surrounds the grana the stroma
Figure 417 The chloroplast has an outer membrane an inner membrane and membrane structures  thylakoids that
are stacked into grana We call the space inside the thylakoid membranes the thylakoid space The light harvesting
reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes and sugar synthesis takes place in the fluid inside the inner
membrane which we call the stroma Chloroplasts also have their own genome which is contained on a single circular
chromosome
The chloroplasts contain a green pigment chlorophyll which captures the light energy that drives the reactions
of photosynthesis Like plant cells photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts Some bacteria perform
photosynthesis but their chlorophyll is not relegated to an organelle
