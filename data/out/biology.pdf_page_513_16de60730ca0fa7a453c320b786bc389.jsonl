phenotypic differences from its close relative the Mexican spotted owl which lives in the south Figure 1812
Figure 1812 The northern spotted owl and the Mexican spotted owl inhabit geographically separate locations with
different climates and ecosystems The owl is an example of allopatric speciation credit northern spotted owl

Additionally scientists have found that the further the distance between two groups that once were the same
species the more likely it is that speciation will occur This seems logical because as the distance increases the
various environmental factors would likely have less in common than locations in close proximity Consider the
two owls in the north the climate is cooler than in the south The types of organisms in each ecosystem differ
as do their behaviors and habits Also the hunting habits and prey choices of the southern owls vary from the
northern owls These variances can lead to evolved differences in the owls and speciation likely will occur
Adaptive Radiation
In some cases a population of one species disperses throughout an area and each finds a distinct niche
or isolated habitat Over time the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events
originating from a single species We call this adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a
single point of origin thus causing the species to radiate into several new ones Island archipelagos like the
Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island
which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms The Hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates one example
of adaptive radiation From a single species the founder species numerous species have evolved including the
six in Figure 1813
