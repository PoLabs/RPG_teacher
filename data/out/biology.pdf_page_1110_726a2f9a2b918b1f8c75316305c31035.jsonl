Neurologist
Neurologists are physicians who specialize in disorders of the nervous system They diagnose and treat
disorders such as epilepsy stroke dementia nervous system injuries Parkinsons disease sleep disorders
and multiple sclerosis Neurologists are medical doctors who have attended college medical school and
completed three to four years of neurology residency
When examining a new patient a neurologist takes a full medical history and performs a complete physical
exam The physical exam contains specific tasks that are used to determine what areas of the brain spinal
cord or peripheral nervous system may be damaged For example to check whether the hypoglossal nerve
is functioning correctly the neurologist will ask the patient to move his or her tongue in different ways If the
patient does not have full control over tongue movements then the hypoglossal nerve may be damaged
or there may be a lesion in the brainstem where the cell bodies of these neurons reside or there could be
damage to the tongue muscle itself
Neurologists have other tools besides a physical exam they can use to diagnose particular problems
in the nervous system If the patient has had a seizure for example the neurologist can use
electroencephalography EEG which involves taping electrodes to the scalp to record brain activity to try
to determine which brain regions are involved in the seizure In suspected stroke patients a neurologist can
use a computerized tomography CT scan which is a type of Xray to look for bleeding in the brain or a
possible brain tumor To treat patients with neurological problems neurologists can prescribe medications
or refer the patient to a neurosurgeon for surgery

Mental Illnesses
Mental illnesses are nervous system disorders that result in problems with thinking mood or relating with other
people These disorders are severe enough to affect a persons quality of life and often make it difficult for
people to perform the routine tasks of daily living Debilitating mental disorders plague approximately 125 million
Americans about 1 in 17 people at an annual cost of more than 300 billion There are several types of mental
disorders including schizophrenia major depression bipolar disorder anxiety disorders and phobias post
traumatic stress disorders and obsessivecompulsive disorder OCD among others The American Psychiatric
Association publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM which describes the
symptoms required for a patient to be diagnosed with a particular mental disorder Each newly released version
of the DSM contains different symptoms and classifications as scientists learn more about these disorders their
causes and how they relate to each other A more detailed discussion of two mental illnessesschizophrenia
and major depressionis given below
Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the United
States Symptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination
inappropriate and unregulated emotional responses difficulty thinking and problems with social situations
People with schizophrenia can suffer from hallucinations and hear voices they may also suffer from delusions
Patients also have socalled negative symptoms like a flattened emotional state loss of pleasure and loss of
basic drives Many schizophrenic patients are diagnosed in their late adolescence or early 20s The development
of schizophrenia is thought to involve malfunctioning dopaminergic neurons and may also involve problems with
glutamate signaling Treatment for the disease usually requires antipsychotic medications that work by blocking
