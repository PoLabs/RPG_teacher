located on a neurons dendrites ion channels open At excitatory synapses this opening allows positive ions
to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membranea decrease in the difference in voltage
between the inside and outside of the neuron A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes
the target neuron to its threshold potential 55 mV Na channels in the axon hillock open allowing positive
ions to enter the cell Figure 3510 and Figure 3511 Once the sodium channels open the neuron completely
depolarizes to a membrane potential of about 40 mV Action potentials are considered an allor nothing event
in that once the threshold potential is reached the neuron always completely depolarizes Once depolarization
is complete the cell must now reset its membrane voltage back to the resting potential To accomplish this
the Na channels close and cannot be opened This begins the neurons refractory period in which it cannot
produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open At the same time voltagegated
K channels open allowing K to leave the cell As K ions leave the cell the membrane potential once again
becomes negative The diffusion of K out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell in that the membrane
potential becomes more negative than the cells normal resting potential At this point the sodium channels will
return to their resting state meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the
threshold potential Eventually the extra K ions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium leakage channels
bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state back to its resting membrane potential
Figure 3511 The formation of an action potential can be divided into five steps 1 A stimulus from a sensory
cell or another neuron causes the target cell to depolarize toward the threshold potential 2 If the threshold of
excitation is reached all Na channels open and the membrane depolarizes 3 At the peak action potential
K channels open and K begins to leave the cell At the same time Na channels close 4 The membrane
becomes hyperpolarized as K ions continue to leave the cell The hyperpolarized membrane is in a refractory
period and cannot fire 5 The K channels close and the NaK transporter restores the resting potential
Potassium channel blockers such as amiodarone and procainamide which are used to treat abnormal
electrical activity in the heart called cardiac dysrhythmia impede the movement of K through voltagegated
K channels Which part of the action potential would you expect potassium channels to affect
