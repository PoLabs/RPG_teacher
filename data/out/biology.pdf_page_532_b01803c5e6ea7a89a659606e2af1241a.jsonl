Before Darwinian evolution became the prevailing theory of the field French naturalist JeanBaptiste Lamarck
theorized that organisms could inherit acquired traits While the majority of scientists have not supported
this hypothesis some have recently begun to realize that Lamarck was not completely wrong Visit this site

Heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that we can attribute to genetic differences or genetic variance
among individuals in a population The greater the heritability of a populations phenotypic variation the more
susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation
We call the diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population genetic variance When scientists are involved
in the breeding of a species such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves they try to increase a
populations genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as possible This also helps reduce
associated risks of inbreeding the mating of closely related individuals which can have the undesirable effect
of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease
For example a disease that is caused by a rare recessive allele might exist in a population but it will only
manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele Because the allele is rare in a normal healthy
population with unrestricted habitat the chance that two carriers will mate is low and even then only 25 percent
of their offspring will inherit the disease allele from both parents While it is likely to happen at some point it will
not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population
and as a result the allele maintains itself at low levels in the gene pool However if a family of carriers begins
to interbreed with each other this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually
producing diseased offspring a phenomenon that scientists call inbreeding depression
Changes in allele frequencies that we identify in a population can shed light on how it is evolving In addition
to natural selection there are other evolutionary forces that could be in play genetic drift gene flow mutation
nonrandom mating and environmental variances
Genetic Drift
The theory of natural selection stems from the observation that some individuals in a population are more likely
to survive longer and have more offspring than others thus they will pass on more of their genes to the next
generation A big powerful male gorilla for example is much more likely than a smaller weaker one to become
the populations silverback the packs leader who mates far more than the other males of the group The pack
leader will father more offspring who share half of his genes and are likely to also grow bigger and stronger like
their father Over time the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population and the population
will as a result grow larger on average That is this would occur if this particular selection pressure or driving
selective force were the only one acting on the population In other examples better camouflage or a stronger
resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure
Another way a populations allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift Figure 194 which
is simply the effect of chance By chance some individuals will have more offspring than othersnot due to an
advantage conferred by some geneticallyencoded trait but just because one male happened to be in the right
place at the right time when the receptive female walked by or because the other one happened to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time when a fox was hunting
