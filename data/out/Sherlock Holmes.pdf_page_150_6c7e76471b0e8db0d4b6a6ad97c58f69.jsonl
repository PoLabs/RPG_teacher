The Adventure of the Copper Beeches
T
o the man who loves art for its own sake
remarked Sherlock Holmes tossing aside
the advertisement sheet of the Daily Tele
graph it is frequently in its least important
and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure
is to be derived It is pleasant to me to observe Wat
son that you have so far grasped this truth that in
these little records of our cases which you have been
good enough to draw up and I am bound to say occa
sionally to embellish you have given prominence not
so much to the many causes celebres and sensational
trials in which I have gured but rather to those inci
dents which may have been trivial in themselves but
which have given room for those faculties of deduc
tion and of logical synthesis which I have made my
special province
And yet said I smiling I cannot quite hold
myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism
which has been urged against my records
You have erred perhaps he observed taking
up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with
it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to re
place his clay when he was in a disputatious rather
than a meditative moodyou have erred perhaps in
attempting to put colour and life into each of your
statements instead of conning yourself to the task of
placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause
to effect which is really the only notable feature about
the thing
It seems to me that I have done you full justice in
the matter I remarked with some coldness for I was
repelled by the egotism which I had more than once
observed to be a strong factor in my friends singular
character
No it is not selshness or conceit said he an
swering as was his wont my thoughts rather than
my words If I claim full justice for my art it is
because it is an impersonal thinga thing beyond
myself Crime is common Logic is rare Therefore it
is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you
should dwell You have degraded what should have
been a course of lectures into a series of tales
It was a cold morning of the early spring and
we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery re
in the old room at Baker Street A thick fog rolled
down between the lines of duncoloured houses and
the opposing windows loomed like dark shapeless
blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths Our gas
was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of
china and metal for the table had not been cleared yet
Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning dip
ping continuously into the advertisement columns of
a succession of papers until at last having apparently
given up his search he had emerged in no very sweet
temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings
At the same time he remarked after a pause
during which he had sat pufng at his long pipe and
gazing down into the re you can hardly be open
to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases
which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal
sense at all The small matter in which I endeavoured
to help the King of Bohemia the singular experience
of Miss Mary Sutherland the problem connected with
the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the
noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the
pale of the law But in avoiding the sensational I fear
that you may have bordered on the trivial
The end may have been so I answered but the
methods I hold to have been novel and of interest
Pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the
great unobservant public who could hardly tell a
weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb
care about the ner shades of analysis and deduction
But indeed if you are trivial I cannot blame you for
the days of the great cases are past Man or at least
criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality
As to my own little practice it seems to be degenerat
ing into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and
giving advice to young ladies from boardingschools
I think that I have touched bottom at last however
This note I had this morning marks my zeropoint I
fancy Read it He tossed a crumpled letter across to
me
It was dated from Montague Place upon the pre
ceding evening and ran thus
Dear Mr Holmes
I am very anxious to consult you as to
whether I should or should not accept a
situation which has been offered to me
as governess I shall call at halfpast ten
tomorrow if I do not inconvenience you
 Yours faithfully
Violet Hunter
Do you know the young lady I asked
Not I
It is halfpast ten now
Yes and I have no doubt that is her ring
It may turn out to be of more interest than you
think You remember that the affair of the blue car
buncle which appeared to be a mere whim at rst
