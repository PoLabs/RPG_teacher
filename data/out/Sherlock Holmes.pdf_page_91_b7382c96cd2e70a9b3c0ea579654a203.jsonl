The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle
My geese The man seemed surprised
Yes I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr
Henry Baker who was a member of your goose club
Ah yes I see But you see sir thems not our
geese
Indeed Whose then
Well I got the two dozen from a salesman in
Covent Garden
Indeed I know some of them Which was it
Breckinridge is his name
Ah I dont know him Well heres your good
health landlord and prosperity to your house Good
night
Now for Mr Breckinridge he continued but
toning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air
Remember Watson that though we have so homely
a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have
at the other a man who will certainly get seven years
penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence
It is possible that our inquiry may but conrm his
guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation
which has been missed by the police and which a sin
gular chance has placed in our hands Let us follow
it out to the bitter end Faces to the south then and
quick march
We passed across Holborn down Endell Street
and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Gar
den Market One of the largest stalls bore the name
of Breckinridge upon it and the proprietor a horsey
looking man with a sharp face and trim sidewhiskers
was helping a boy to put up the shutters
Goodevening Its a cold night said Holmes
The salesman nodded and shot a questioning
glance at my companion
Sold out of geese I see continued Holmes
pointing at the bare slabs of marble
Let you have ve hundred tomorrow morning
Thats no good
Well there are some on the stall with the gas
are
Ah but I was recommended to you
Who by
The landlord of the Alpha
Oh yes I sent him a couple of dozen
Fine birds they were too Now where did you
get them from
To my surprise the question provoked a burst of
anger from the salesman
Now then mister said he with his head cocked
and his arms akimbo what are you driving at Lets
have it straight now
It is straight enough I should like to know who
sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha
Well then I shant tell you So now
Oh it is a matter of no importance but I dont
know why you should be so warm over such a trie
Warm Youd be as warm maybe if you were
as pestered as I am When I pay good money for a
good article there should be an end of the business
but its Where are the geese and Who did you
sell the geese to and What will you take for the
geese One would think they were the only geese in
the world to hear the fuss that is made over them
Well I have no connection with any other people
who have been making inquiries said Holmes care
lessly If you wont tell us the bet is off that is all
But Im always ready to back my opinion on a matter
of fowls and I have a ver on it that the bird I ate is
country bred
Well then youve lost your ver for its town
bred snapped the salesman
Its nothing of the kind
I say it is
I dont believe it
Dyou think you know more about fowls than I
who have handled them ever since I was a nipper I
tell you all those birds that went to the Alpha were
town bred
Youll never persuade me to believe that
Will you bet then
Its merely taking your money for I know that I
am right But Ill have a sovereign on with you just
to teach you not to be obstinate
The salesman chuckled grimly
Bring me the
books Bill said he
The small boy brought round a small thin vol
ume and a great greasybacked one laying them out
together beneath the hanging lamp
Now then Mr Cocksure said the salesman I
thought that I was out of geese but before I nish
youll nd that there is still one left in my shop You
see this little book
Well
Thats the list of the folk from whom I buy Dyou
see Well then here on this page are the country folk
and the numbers after their names are where their
accounts are in the big ledger Now then You see
