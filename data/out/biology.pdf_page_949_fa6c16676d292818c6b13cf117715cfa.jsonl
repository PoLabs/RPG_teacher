a plant is tilted the statoliths drop to the new bottom cell wall A few hours later the shoot or root will show
growth in the new vertical direction
The mechanism that mediates gravitropism is reasonably well understood When amyloplasts settle to the
bottom of the gravitysensing cells in the root or shoot they physically contact the endoplasmic reticulum ER
causing the release of calcium ions from inside the ER This calcium signaling in the cells causes polar transport
of the plant hormone IAA to the bottom of the cell In roots a high concentration of IAA inhibits cell elongation
The effect slows growth on the lower side of the root while cells develop normally on the upper side IAA has the
opposite effect in shoots where a higher concentration at the lower side of the shoot stimulates cell expansion
causing the shoot to grow up After the shoot or root begin to grow vertically the amyloplasts return to their
normal position Other hypothesesinvolving the entire cell in the gravitropism effecthave been proposed to
explain why some mutants that lack amyloplasts may still exhibit a weak gravitropic response
Growth Responses
A plants sensory response to external stimuli relies on chemical messengers hormones Plant hormones
affect all aspects of plant life from flowering to fruit setting and maturation and from phototropism to leaf fall
Potentially every cell in a plant can produce plant hormones They can act in their cell of origin or be transported
to other portions of the plant body with many plant responses involving the synergistic or antagonistic interaction
of two or more hormones In contrast animal hormones are produced in specific glands and transported to a
distant site for action and they act alone
Plant hormones are a group of unrelated chemical substances that affect plant morphogenesis Five major plant
hormones are traditionally described auxins particularly IAA cytokinins gibberellins ethylene and abscisic
acid In addition other nutrients and environmental conditions can be characterized as growth factors
Auxins
The term auxin is derived from the Greek word auxein which means to grow Auxins are the main hormones
responsible for cell elongation in phototropism and gravitropism They also control the differentiation of meristem
into vascular tissue and promote leaf development and arrangement While many synthetic auxins are used
as herbicides IAA is the only naturally occurring auxin that shows physiological activity Apical dominancethe
inhibition of lateral bud formationis triggered by auxins produced in the apical meristem Flowering fruit setting
and ripening and inhibition of abscission leaf falling are other plant responses under the direct or indirect
control of auxins Auxins also act as a relay for the effects of the blue light and redfarred responses
Commercial use of auxins is widespread in plant nurseries and for crop production IAA is used as a rooting
hormone to promote growth of adventitious roots on cuttings and detached leaves Applying synthetic auxins
to tomato plants in greenhouses promotes normal fruit development Outdoor application of auxin promotes
synchronization of fruit setting and dropping to coordinate the harvesting season Fruits such as seedless
cucumbers can be induced to set fruit by treating unfertilized plant flowers with auxins
Cytokinins
The effect of cytokinins was first reported when it was found that adding the liquid endosperm of coconuts
to developing plant embryos in culture stimulated their growth The stimulating growth factor was found to
be cytokinin a hormone that promotes cytokinesis cell division Almost 200 naturally occurring or synthetic
cytokinins are known to date Cytokinins are most abundant in growing tissues such as roots embryos and
fruits where cell division is occurring Cytokinins are known to delay senescence in leaf tissues promote mitosis
and stimulate differentiation of the meristem in shoots and roots Many effects on plant development are under
the influence of cytokinins either in conjunction with auxin or another hormone For example apical dominance
seems to result from a balance between auxins that inhibit lateral buds and cytokinins that promote bushier
growth
Gibberellins
Gibberellins GAs are a group of about 125 closely related plant hormones that stimulate shoot elongation
seed germination and fruit and flower maturation GAs are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems
young leaves and seed embryos In urban areas GA antagonists are sometimes applied to trees under power
lines to control growth and reduce the frequency of pruning
GAs break dormancy a state of inhibited growth and development in the seeds of plants that require exposure
to cold or light to germinate Abscisic acid is a strong antagonist of GA action Other effects of GAs include
gender expression seedless fruit development and the delay of senescence in leaves and fruit Seedless
grapes are obtained through standard breeding methods and contain inconspicuous seeds that fail to develop
