Gender Inequalities
The dramatic shifts and development of the status representation and 
experience of women over the course of the twentieth century does on the 
surface suggest steady progress Just think how dramatically differently 
women dressed behaved worked and spent their leisure time in 1900 than in 
2000 But the attainment of political rights and citizenship the entry of large 
numbers of women into the workforce and the legal and attitudinal shifts about 
sex and sexuality all mask the cyclical nature of womens emancipation and the 
peaks and troughs of the feminist movement Women in the twentieth century 
began to organise internationally and transnationally in their shared struggles 
for political social and economic equality but the strength of feminism varied 
widely over time and space There were important differences in the scope 
and size of European feminist movements between north and south between 
democracies and dictatorshipsor during the Cold War between communist 
and capitalist or mixedeconomy welfare states
The first European country to give women the vote was Finland in 1906 
followed by Denmark 1908 The First World War would prove to be a catalyst 
for the extension of citizenship rights to women in many countries This was 
both the result of effective and inspiring suffrage campaigns the militant 
suffragettes in Britain became international icons and due to womens 
sacrifices and war service on the home front
