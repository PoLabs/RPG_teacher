Economic Environment
Liberalisation and industrialisation characterise the most prominent aspects 
of economic transformation in nineteenthcentury Europe At the same time 
these were uniform processes and their historical trajectory exemplifies 
the continents huge divergence While already in 1800 the textile mills of
