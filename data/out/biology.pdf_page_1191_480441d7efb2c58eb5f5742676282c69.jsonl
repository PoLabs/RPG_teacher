that consist of 3050 percent chitin a polysaccharide derivative of glucose that is a strong but flexible material
Chitin is secreted by the epidermal cells The exoskeleton is further strengthened by the addition of calcium
carbonate in organisms such as the lobster Because the exoskeleton is acellular arthropods must periodically
shed their exoskeletons because the exoskeleton does not grow as the organism grows

Endoskeleton
An endoskeleton is a skeleton that consists of hard mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of
organisms An example of a primitive endoskeletal structure is the spicules of sponges The bones of vertebrates
are composed of tissues whereas sponges have no true tissues Figure 384 Endoskeletons provide support
for the body protect internal organs and allow for movement through contraction of muscles attached to the
skeleton
Figure 384 The skeletons of humans and horses are examples of endoskeletons credit Ross Murphy
The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that consists of 206 bones in the adult It has five main functions
providing support to the body storing minerals and lipids producing blood cells protecting internal organs and
