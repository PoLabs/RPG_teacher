Marjorie Meiss Maarten Prak and Phil Withington
Introduction
One of the defining features of the early modern era in Europe was economic 
development Between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries changes in the 
way that goods were produced exchanged purchased and consumed had 
a huge impact on the lives of all European men and women and significant 
ramifications for European relations with the Americas Asia and Africa 
This chapter introduces these developments by focusing on the concept of 
consumer society meaning a society in which significant numbers of people 
have at once the disposable means in cash or credit opportunity through 
supply and retail and desire however constructed to choose to purchase 
goods that they may or may not need Since the 1990s consumer society has 
become a key concept of economic social and cultural history and is a useful 
way of thinking about the range of economic change that characterised much 
of Europe before the onset of industrialisation in the nineteenth century
When Was the Consumer Society Born 
Historians agree that consumer society flourished after the Second World 
War in the western world but there is intense debate concerning its date of 
birth A longlasting narrative depicted consumer society as a result of the 
industrial revolution in this account profound change in the conditions 
of production of consumer goods at the end of the eighteenth century and 
during the nineteenth century led to an impressive growth in supply and 
lower prices New advertising and selling practices as well as new commercial 
spaces shopping arcades department stores induced customersincluding 
the betteroff working classesto buy more and more goods
