Conclusion
The other and othering have always been openended discursive practices 
devoid of fixed content They have been operationalised in the European 
imagination while rarely corresponding to historical reality in order to justify 
colonial or neocolonial control They have thus held different functions 
and connotations at different moments in time and with regard to different 
continents and regions making it difficult to explain their workings precisely 
However there is perhaps one exception othering has clearly helped Europe 
style itself as the exceptional continent distinguished from the rest Despite the 
decline and collapse of European empires this did not change fundamentally 
during the twentieth century In political discourse popular culture and 
international relations Europeans still often referred to stereotypes such 
as infantile Africans despotic Orientals or even consumerist Americans to 
describe the world defining themselves as superior in the process Responding 
to the shifting global geopolitics of the twentieth century old fears of invading 
barbarian hordes were updated as red scares or visions of CocaColonisation 
but still they served the same purpose of characterising European civilisation 
as the model for the world
