CREATING
Social media allows you to engage with an online community and connect your brand to 
the appropriate audience Together these create an online community for your brand and its 
supporters Social media has created a forum for brand evangelists 
The interactions on social allow you to garner feedback from your communities Such feedback 
helps drive future business insights and innovation as well as marketing strategies You can 
learn more about your audiences likes dislikesbehaviours and needs 
However companies need also be aware that bad messages spread as quickly as good ones 
The connectedness that can prove so useful can also be a conduit for negative messages 
and brand attacks 
Social media facilitates a twoway conversation between customer and company This necessi
tates that the company shifts approach from deploy and watch to one of constant involvement 
with the audience 
This new landscape is one in which the customer really is king and any attempt to dethrone 
the king can have dire consequences Efforts to control the conversation in social media are 
soon found out and can backfire horribly Any company embarking on a social media strategy 
needs to be sure to monitor their reputation online regularly Its crucial to know what is being 
said about your brand online and to respond timeously when communicating in the social 
media sphere 
Finally never forget that special rules and laws apply when you are dealing with personal 
information provided by users be very careful how and where you use this data
