Introduction
At the outset of the nineteenth century Europe was a continent in motion The 
Atlantic Revolutions most prominently in the United States 17651783 and 
France 17891799 had created new political energies had spread powerful 
new ideas about democracy and individual freedom and had generated 
social changes within European societies These energies were mirrored 
by technological innovations which transformed Europeans relationship 
to information The combination of new societal energies with the new 
information technologies that became available spawned the emergence of 
mass media and shaped the popular culture of the nineteenth century and 
beyond 
This was a very uneven process impacting European societies to significantly 
varying degrees both within states and across the continent Mainly in urban 
areas and industrialising regions but in some agricultural regions as well 
this process impacted the way in which exchanges of information took place 
Furthermore it brought about a change in the accessibility of information to 
different segments of the population and transformed the information that 
could be produced and disseminated 
Some of these transformative massmedia technologies were already 
established at the start of the century newspapers and publishing for example 
were already widespread but still saw their audiences grow exponentially 
over the course of the century and their role in society was transformed Other 
forms of technology were newsuch as photography which was presented 
to the public in 1839 or sound recording which was made possible by the 
development of the phonograph in the 1870s
