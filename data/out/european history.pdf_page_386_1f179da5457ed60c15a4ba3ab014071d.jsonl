when Habsburg German mercenary troops or Spanish infantry annihilated 
the Valois cavalry Pavia 1525 Saint Quentin 1557 The innovative successes 
of the Habsburgs would therefore come from a communion between the 
service of the nobility in arms and new corps equipped with heavy artillery 
pikes and firearms integrated into coronelas Spanish military corps organised 
by Gonzalo Fernndez de Crdoba the Great Captain 14531515 and the 
consequent tercios formed by Charles V between 1534 and 1536 This would 
not mean the demise of chivalric usages especially in a monarchysuch as 
the Spanish onewhose highest award was the Order of the Golden Fleece 
and which had numerous knights belonging to the Order of Malta or the 
Castilian Valencian and Portuguese military religions This symbiosis as 
in other European cases was based on the dissemination of the archetype of 
the courtier skilled in arms and letters as advocated by Count Baldassare 
Castiglione 14781529 in his book Il Cortegiano published in 1528 
The triumph of the Habsburgs Charles V and Philip II over France did 
not tarnish the success that other powers would enjoy on the continent and 
in the Mediterranean world The successful model of military organisation 
employed by the Ottoman Empire was a case in point After the conquest of 
Constantinople 1453 and Turkish expansion over the last Byzantine or Latin

resources The forced recruitment and Islamisation of Christian children from 
lands dominated by the Sublime Porte created a large pool of human capital 
the Janissaries who were fully trained in war and loyal to the sultan and his 
grand viziers Alongside the Janissaries the sipahisTurks who owned a 
fief timarprovided the Ottoman land armies with a large cavalry corps 
while a systematic plan was implemented to build artillery galleys which in 
conjunction with the corsairs of the Barbary Regencies would periodically 
ravage the Italian and Iberian coasts and confront the naval forces of the King 
of Spain or the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller of Malta 
Finally between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and as a direct 
consequence of the rebellion of Dutch nobles and cities against Philip II a 
new system of military order and strategy emerged one that would have a 
decisive influence on the evolution of warfare for the rest of the early modern 
age the military innovations of Maurice of OrangeNassau 15671625 The 
son of Prince William of Orange 15331584 from his youth he was trained 
in the combat practices of the Flemish rebels and their English French and 
German allies against the Spanish tercios With strongly disciplined but fewer 
than usual troops able to sustain a continuous rate of fire of arquebuses and
