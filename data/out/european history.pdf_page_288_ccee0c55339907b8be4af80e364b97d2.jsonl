spending In Holland the most heavily taxed region in Europe at the time 
taxation claimed five to seven percent of a workers wage or a guild masters 
income in the late sixteenth century and over twice as much by the end of 
the seventeenth century Over the same period Hollands debts had increased 
from below ten million guilders to over 200 million They would double again 
during the eighteenth century
Organising and coordinating this expanding state demanded more 
personnel almost always male Traditionally most of the states business had 
been done by men who were not employed by the state itself an arrangement 
that continued even while the number of state employees was rising This 
applied everywhere and on all levels of society Military officers were 
recruiting and paying their own soldiers which meant that provisioning 
the army was a private business Locally offices like poor relief policing or 
the fire service were parttime and went unpaid It is therefore impossible to 
compare presentday numbers of civil servants with those of the early modern 
era Still we do know that in the early sixteenth century the French state had 
70008000 royal officers alongside their administrative staff or around one 
for every 2000 inhabitants By the end of the seventeenth century there were 
60000 officers and another 20000 collecting taxes which again was technically 
a private business in much of France Together they numbered one for every 
200 inhabitants a very steep increase that cannot be explained by changing 
definitions alone
Officeholders and staff were also better trained This period saw the rise of 
academics and other professionals in the service of the state In multinational 
Spain the new court councils and juntas temporary or specialised committees 
along with their respective secretariats were made up of a large group of 
lawyers aristocrats and military personnel Among the thirtytwo members 
who joined the Amsterdam city council between 1600 and 1619 six held an 
academic degree mostly in law by 1700 it was exceptional for a councillor 
not to have one With the professionalisation of bureaucracies came written 
job descriptions and printed forms to collect standardised information about 
population sizes poor relief and inevitably taxes The situation was rather 
different in Russia however where the lack of universities the first one 
opened in 1755 and other training institutions meant that the expanding class 
of bureaucrats would learn on the job Professional training emerged there 
only in the mideighteenth century and remained rudimentary until the 1830s 
This professionalisation should not be confused with the rise of the 
bourgeoisie It is true that increasingly the nobility was unable to occupy all 
positions of influence not least because their numbers fell short But we cant 
be as sure as previous generations of historians that this was part of a deliberate 
process to sideline the nobles In many monarchies successful administrators
