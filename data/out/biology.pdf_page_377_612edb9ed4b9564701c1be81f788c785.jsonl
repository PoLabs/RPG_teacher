Figure 135 This karyotype is of a female human Notice that homologous chromosomes are the same size and have
the same centromere positions and banding patterns A human male would have an XY chromosome pair instead of
the XX pair credit Andreas Blozer et al
In a given species we can identify chromosomes by their number size centromere position and banding
pattern In a human karyotype autosomes or body chromosomes all of the nonsex chromosomes are
generally organized in approximate order of size from largest chromosome 1 to smallest chromosome 22
The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes However chromosome 21 is actually shorter than chromosome
22 Researchers discovered this after naming Down syndrome as trisomy 21 reflecting how this disease results
from possessing one extra chromosome 21 three total Not wanting to change the name of this important
disease scientists retained the numbering of chromosome 21 despite describing it having the shortest set of
chromosomes We may designate the chromosome arms projecting from either end of the centromere as short
or long depending on their relative lengths We abbreviate the short arm p for petite whereas we abbreviate
the long arm q because it follows p alphabetically Numbers further subdivide and denote each arm Using
this naming system we can describe chromosome locations consistently in the scientific literature
