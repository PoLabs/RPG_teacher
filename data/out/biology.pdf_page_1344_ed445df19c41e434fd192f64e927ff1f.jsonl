CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
22 Different MHC I molecules between donor and
recipient cells can lead to rejection of a transplanted
organ or tissue Suggest a reason for this
23 If a series of genetic mutations prevented some
but not all of the complement proteins from binding
antibodies or pathogens would the entire
complement system be compromised
24 Explain the difference between an epitope and an
antigen
25 What is a nave B or T cell
26 How does the TH1 response differ from the TH2
response
27 In mammalian adaptive immune systems T cell
receptors are extraordinarily diverse What function
of the immune system results from this diversity and
how is this diversity achieved
28 How do B and T cells differ with respect to
antigens that they bind
29 Why is the immune response after reinfection
much faster than the adaptive immune response after
the initial infection
30 What are the benefits and costs of antibody cross
reactivity
