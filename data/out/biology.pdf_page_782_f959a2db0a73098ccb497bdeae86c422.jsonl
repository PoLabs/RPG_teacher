Figure 279 Diploblastic and triploblastic embryos During embryogenesis diploblasts develop two embryonic
germ layers an ectoderm and an endoderm or mesendoderm Triploblasts develop a third layerthe
mesodermwhich arises from mesendoderm and resides between the endoderm and ectoderm
Which of the following statements about diploblasts and triploblasts is false
a
Animals that display only radial symmetry during their lifespans are diploblasts
b
Animals that display bilateral symmetry are triploblasts
c
The endoderm gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract and the respiratory tract
d
The mesoderm gives rise to the central nervous system
Each of the three germ layers is programmed to give rise to specific body tissues and organs although there
are variations on these themes Generally speaking the endoderm gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract
including the stomach intestines liver and pancreas as well as to the lining of the trachea bronchi and
lungs of the respiratory tract along with a few other structures The ectoderm develops into the outer epithelial
covering of the body surface the central nervous system and a few other structures The mesoderm is the
third germ layer it forms between the endoderm and ectoderm in triploblasts This germ layer gives rise to all
specialized muscle tissues including the cardiac tissues and muscles of the intestines connective tissues such
as the skeleton and blood cells and most other visceral organs such as the kidneys and the spleen Diploblastic
animals may have cell types that serve multiple functions such as epitheliomuscular cells which serve as a
covering as well as contractile cells
Presence or Absence of a Coelom
Further subdivision of animals with three germ layers triploblasts results in the separation of animals that may
develop an internal body cavity derived from mesoderm called a coelom and those that do not This epithelial
celllined coelomic cavity usually filled with fluid lies between the visceral organs and the body wall It houses
many organs such as the digestive urinary and reproductive systems the heart and lungs and also contains
the major arteries and veins of the circulatory system In mammals the body cavity is divided into the thoracic
cavity which houses the heart and lungs and the abdominal cavity which houses the digestive organs In the
thoracic cavity further subdivision produces the pleural cavity which provides space for the lungs to expand
during breathing and the pericardial cavity which provides room for movements of the heart The evolution of
the coelom is associated with many functional advantages For example the coelom provides cushioning and
shock absorption for the major organ systems that it encloses In addition organs housed within the coelom can
grow and move freely which promotes optimal organ development and placement The coelom also provides
space for the diffusion of gases and nutrients as well as body flexibility promoting improved animal motility
Triploblasts that do not develop a coelom are called acoelomates and their mesoderm region is completely
filled with tissue although they do still have a gut cavity Examples of acoelomates include animals in the
phylum Platyhelminthes also known as flatworms Animals with a true coelom are called eucoelomates or
coelomates Figure 2710 In such cases a true coelom arises entirely within the mesoderm germ layer
and is lined by an epithelial membrane This membrane also lines the organs within the coelom connecting
and holding them in position while allowing them some freedom of movement Annelids mollusks arthropods
