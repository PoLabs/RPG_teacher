The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor
You can understand said Holmes suavely that
I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same
secrecy which I promise to you in yours
Of course Very right very right Im sure I beg
pardon As to my own case I am ready to give you
any information which may assist you in forming an
opinion
Thank you I have already learned all that is in
the public prints nothing more I presume that I may
take it as correctthis article for example as to the
disappearance of the bride
Lord St Simon glanced over it Yes it is correct
as far as it goes
But it needs a great deal of supplementing before
anyone could offer an opinion I think that I may
arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you
Pray do so
When did you rst meet Miss Hatty Doran
In San Francisco a year ago
You were travelling in the States
Yes
Did you become engaged then
No
But you were on a friendly footing
I was amused by her society and she could see
that I was amused
Her father is very rich
He is said to be the richest man on the Pacic
slope
And how did he make his money
In mining He had nothing a few years ago Then
he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and
bounds
Now what is your own impression as to the
young ladysyour wifes character
The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and
stared down into the re You see Mr Holmes
said he my wife was twenty before her father be
came a rich man During that time she ran free in a
mining camp and wandered through woods or moun
tains so that her education has come from Nature
rather than from the schoolmaster She is what we
call in England a tomboy with a strong nature wild
and free unfettered by any sort of traditions She
is impetuousvolcanic I was about to say She is
swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying
out her resolutions On the other hand I would not
have given her the name which I have the honour
to bearhe gave a little stately coughhad not I
thought her to be at bottom a noble woman I believe
that she is capable of heroic selfsacrice and that
anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her
Have you her photograph
I brought this with me He opened a locket and
showed us the full face of a very lovely woman It
was not a photograph but an ivory miniature and
the artist had brought out the full effect of the lus
trous black hair the large dark eyes and the exquisite
mouth Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it Then
he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St
Simon
The young lady came to London then and you
renewed your acquaintance
Yes her father brought her over for this last Lon
don season I met her several times became engaged
to her and have now married her
She brought
I understand
a considerable
dowry
A fair dowry
Not more than is usual in my
family
And this of course remains to you since the
marriage is a fait accompli
I really have made no inquiries on the subject
Very naturally not Did you see Miss Doran on
the day before the wedding
Yes
Was she in good spirits
Never better She kept talking of what we should
do in our future lives
Indeed That is very interesting And on the
morning of the wedding
She was as bright as possibleat least until after
the ceremony
And did you observe any change in her then
Well to tell the truth I saw then the rst signs
that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little
sharp The incident however was too trivial to relate
and can have no possible bearing upon the case
Pray let us have it for all that
Oh it is childish She dropped her bouquet as
we went towards the vestry She was passing the front
pew at the time and it fell over into the pew There
was a moments delay but the gentleman in the pew
handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be
the worse for the fall Yet when I spoke to her of the
matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage
on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over
this triing cause
