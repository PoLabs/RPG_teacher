Figure 3622 Human rod cells and the different types of cone cells each have an optimal wavelength However there
is considerable overlap in the wavelengths of light detected
Retinal Processing
Visual signals leave the cones and rods travel to the bipolar cells and then to ganglion cells A large degree of
processing of visual information occurs in the retina itself before visual information is sent to the brain
Photoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity That is they are always slightly active even
when not stimulated by light In neurons that exhibit tonic activity the absence of stimuli maintains a firing rate at
a baseline while some stimuli increase firing rate from the baseline and other stimuli decrease firing rate In the
absence of light the bipolar neurons that connect rods and cones to ganglion cells are continuously and actively
inhibited by the rods and cones Exposure of the retina to light hyperpolarizes the rods and cones and removes
their inhibition of bipolar cells The now active bipolar cells in turn stimulate the ganglion cells which send action
potentials along their axons which leave the eye as the optic nerve Thus the visual system relies on change in
retinal activity rather than the absence or presence of activity to encode visual signals for the brain Sometimes
horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other photoreceptors and to several bipolar cells When a
rod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell the horizontal cell inhibits more distant photoreceptors and bipolar cells
creating lateral inhibition This inhibition sharpens edges and enhances contrast in the images by making regions
receiving light appear lighter and dark surroundings appear darker Amacrine cells can distribute information
from one bipolar cell to many ganglion cells
You can demonstrate this using an easy demonstration to trick your retina and brain about the colors you are
observing in your visual field Look fixedly at Figure 3623 for about 45 seconds Then quickly shift your gaze to
a sheet of blank white paper or a white wall You should see an afterimage of the Norwegian flag in its correct
colors At this point close your eyes for a moment then reopen them looking again at the white paper or wall
the afterimage of the flag should continue to appear as red white and blue What causes this According to
an explanation called opponent process theory as you gazed fixedly at the green black and yellow flag your
retinal ganglion cells that respond positively to green black and yellow increased their firing dramatically When
you shifted your gaze to the neutral white ground these ganglion cells abruptly decreased their activity and the
brain interpreted this abrupt downshift as if the ganglion cells were responding now to their opponent colors
red white and blue respectively in the visual field Once the ganglion cells return to their baseline activity state
the false perception of color will disappear
