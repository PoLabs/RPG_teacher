Scientists have developed a classification scheme that categorizes all members of the animal kingdom although
there are exceptions to most rules governing animal classification Figure 276 Animals have been
traditionally classified according to two characteristics body plan and developmental pathway The major feature
of the body plan is its symmetry how the body parts are distributed along the major body axis Symmetrical
animals can be divided into roughly equivalent halves along at least one axis Developmental characteristics
include the number of germ tissue layers formed during development the origin of the mouth and anus the
presence or absence of an internal body cavity and other features of embryological development such as larval
types or whether or not periods of growth are interspersed with molting
Figure 276 Animal phylogeny The phylogenetic tree of animals is based on morphological fossil and genetic
evidence The Ctenophora and Porifera are both considered to be basal because of the absence of Hox genes in
this group but how they are related to the Parahoxozoa Placozoa  Eumetazoa or to each other continues to
be a matter of debate
Which of the following statements is false
a
Eumetazoans have specialized tissues and parazoans dont
b
Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa are both Bilataria
c
Acoela and Cnidaria both possess radial symmetry
d
Arthropods are more closely related to nematodes than they are to annelids
