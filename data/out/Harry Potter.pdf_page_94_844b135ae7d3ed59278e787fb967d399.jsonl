You might belong in Hufflepuff
Where they are just and loyal
Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw
if youve a ready mind
Where those of wit and learning
Will always find their kind
Or perhaps in Slytherin
Youll make your real friends
Those cunning folk use any means
To achieve their ends
So put me on Dont be afraid
And dont get in a flap
Youre in safe hands though I have none
For Im a Thinking Cap
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song It
bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again
So weve just got to try on the hat Ron whispered to Harry Ill
kill Fred he was going on about wrestling a troll
Harry smiled weakly Yes trying on the hat was a lot better than
having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on
without everyone watching The hat seemed to be asking rather alot
Harry didnt feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment If
only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy
that would have been the one for him
