The Paleozoic Era and the Evolution of Vertebrates
When the vertebrates arose during the Paleozoic Era 542 to 251 MYA the climate and geography of
Earth was vastly different The distribution of landmasses on Earth were also very different from that of
today Near the equator were two large supercontinents Laurentia and Gondwana which included most of
todays continents but in a radically different configuration Figure 2921 At this time sea levels were very
high probably at a level that hasnt been reached since As the Paleozoic progressed glaciations created
a cool global climate but conditions warmed near the end of the first half of the Paleozoic During the latter
half of the Paleozoic the landmasses began moving together with the initial formation of a large northern
block called Laurasia which contained parts of what is now North America along with Greenland parts of
Europe and Siberia Eventually a single supercontinent called Pangaea was formed starting in the latter
third of the Paleozoic Glaciations then began to affect Pangaeas climate and the distribution of vertebrate
life

Gondwana formed Both Gondwana and the continent Laurentia were located near the equator
During the early Paleozoic the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was much greater than it is
today This may have begun to change later as land plants became more common As the roots of land
plants began to infiltrate rock and soil began to form carbon dioxide was drawn out of the atmosphere and
became trapped in the rock This reduced the levels of carbon dioxide and increased the levels of oxygen in
the atmosphere so that by the end of the Paleozoic atmospheric conditions were similar to those of today
As plants became more common through the latter half of the Paleozoic microclimates began to emerge
and ecosystems began to change As plants and ecosystems continued to grow and become more complex
vertebrates moved from the water to land The presence of shoreline vegetation may have contributed to
the movement of vertebrates onto land One hypothesis suggests that the fins of aquatic vertebrates were
used to maneuver through this vegetation providing a precursor to the movement of fins on land and the
further development of limbs The late Paleozoic was a time of diversification of vertebrates as amniotes
emerged and became two different lines that gave rise on one hand to synapsids and mammals and on
