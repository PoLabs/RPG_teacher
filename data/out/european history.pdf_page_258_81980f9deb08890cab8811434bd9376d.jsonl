African peoples that prevented the easy creation of a uniform black race 
However with the growth of slave societies throughout the New World in the 
seventeenth century and especially the eighteenth century new racist views

status in the constitutions of states such as the United States France and Haiti

ever promised universal equality From that moment on inequality required 
debate and explicit justification
