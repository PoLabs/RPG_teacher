Diet The third and longest phase unfolding over the seventeenth century 
was marked by the rule of a series of Calvinist princes The peace treaties of 
Vienna 1606 and Linz 1645 between the Habsburgs and Transylvanian 
rulers contributed to the consolidation of the rights of Protestants in Hungary
Notwithstanding confessional upheavals perturbing the court elite 
religious conflict was significantly moderated by a system of compromise 
stemming from a series of laws issued by the Transylvanian Diet during 
the late sixteenth century The result of these legal instruments was the 
official acknowledgement of four accepted religions Calvinist Lutheran 
Antitrinitarian or Unitarian and Catholic religions other than these four 
were merely tolerated by the state Religion an organising principle of the 
Transylvanian society of estates joined with a political category defining 
ones status the natio The state acknowledged a system consisting of 
three political units called nations an early modern term with a different 
meaning from the one established in the nineteenth century each having a set 
of special privileges as well as representation at the Diet Hungarian nobles 
Saxon ethnic German burghers and the Szkler or Szkely a Hungarian
speaking group that differed in legal terms from the Hungarian nobility The 
two categoriespolitical and confessionalcould overlap as in the case of 
Saxons being predominantly Lutheran or be detached from each other as 
with Hungarians having Calvinists Antitrinitarians and Catholics among 
them The systems featuring of four accepted religions and three political 
nations was not allembracing Most notably it did not allow Romanians 
who were predominantly Orthodox though the Protestant Reformation 
and the GreekCatholicUniate project affected their ranks to create a 
natio on their own and advance their confession among the accepted ones 
despite their demographic significance After the 1690s when the Habsburg 
Dynasty captured Transylvania the confessional system remained basically 
unchanged with the difference that the Catholic institutions of Transylvania 
were restored The exclusion of Romanians from both categories preventing 
them from representing themselves by autonomous bodies in political and 
religious terms was a cause of rampant tension from the eighteenth century 
onwards By the nineteenth century the limits and obsolescence of the twofold 
system became all the more visible in the context of liberal reforms and national 
movements
Conclusion
Whereas the early modern religious history of Europe is usually framed as a 
split within Christianity in which the Reformation led to a conflict between 
Protestants and Catholics Christianity was much more pluriform and fluid
