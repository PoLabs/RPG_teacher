Calculated by the size of his domains which covered the Holy Roman Empire 
Germany and Austria the Low Countries Belgium Luxemburg and the 
Netherlands Spain as well as substantial parts of Italy not to mention 
overseas territories in Asia and the Americas Charles V 15001558 was the 
most powerful ruler of the early modern period His power was however 
challenged throughout his reign It started with the Comunero revolt in Castile 
and the simultaneous Germanias guilds revolt in 1520 in Valencia Mallorca 
and Aragon Charles managed to subdue them militarily but he afterwards 
gave in to many of the rebels demands In Germany however he failed 
to suppress the Reformation and this failure highlighted in the Peace of 
Augsburg in 1555 led directly to his voluntary abdication in that same year 
How did ordinary Europeans manage to topple the most powerful ruler of 
their time
