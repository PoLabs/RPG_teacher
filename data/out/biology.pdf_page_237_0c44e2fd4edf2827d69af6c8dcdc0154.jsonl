Chapter Outline
81 Overview of Photosynthesis
82 The LightDependent Reactions of Photosynthesis
83 Using Light Energy to Make Organic Molecules
Introduction
The metabolic processes in all organismsfrom bacteria to humansrequire energy To get this energy many
organisms access stored energy by eating that is by ingesting other organisms But where does the stored
energy in food originate All of this energy can be traced back to photosynthesis
81  Overview of Photosynthesis
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain the significance of photosynthesis to other living organisms

Describe the main structures involved in photosynthesis

Identify the substrates and products of photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is essential to all life on earth both plants and animals depend on it It is the only biological
process that can capture energy that originates from sunlight and converts it into chemical compounds
