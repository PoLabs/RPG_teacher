Nah Im all right thanks Ron
Would you mind moving out of the way came Malfoys cold drawl from
behind them Are you trying to earn some extra money Weasley Hoping
to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts I suppose  that hut
of Hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used
to
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs
WEASLEY
Ron let go of the front of Malfoys robes
He was provoked Professor Snape said Hagrid sticking his huge hairy
face out from behind the tree Malfoy was insultin his family
Be that as it may fighting is against Hogwarts rules Hagrid said
Snape silkily Five points from Gryffindor Weasley and be grateful it
isnt more Move along all of you
Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering
needles everywhere and smirking
Ill get him said Ron grinding his teeth at Malfoys back one of
these days Ill get him 
I hate them both said Harry Malfoy and Snape
Come on cheer up its nearly Christmas said Hagrid Tell yeh what
come with me an see the Great Hall looks a treat
So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great
Hall where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with
the Christmas decorations
Ah Hagrid the last tree  put it in the far corner would you
The hall looked spectacular Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all
around the walls and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood
around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with
hundreds of candles
