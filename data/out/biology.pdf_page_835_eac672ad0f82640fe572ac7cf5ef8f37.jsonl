Parasitic Nematodes
A number of common parasitic nematodes serve as prime examples of parasitism endoparasitism These
economically and medically important animals exhibit complex life cycles that often involve multiple hosts and
they can have significant medical and veterinary impacts Here is a partial list of nasty nematodes Humans
may become infected by Dracunculus medinensis known as guinea worms when they drink unfiltered water
containing copepods Figure 2834 an intermediate crustacean host Hookworms such as Ancylostoma and
Necator infest the intestines and feed on the blood of mammals especially of dogs cats and humans Trichina
worms Trichinella are the causal organism of trichinosis in humans often resulting from the consumption of
undercooked pork Trichinella can infect other mammalian hosts as well Ascaris a large intestinal roundworm
steals nutrition from its human host and may create physical blockage of the intestines The filarial worms such
as Dirofilaria and Wuchereria are commonly vectored by mosquitoes which pass the infective agents among
mammals through their bloodsucking activity One species Wuchereria bancrofti infects the lymph nodes of
over 120 million people worldwide usually producing a nonlethal but deforming condition called elephantiasis
In this disease parts of the body often swell to gigantic proportions due to obstruction of lymphatic drainage
inflammation of lymphatic tissues and resulting edema Dirofilaria immitis a bloodinfective parasite is the
notorious dog heartworm species
