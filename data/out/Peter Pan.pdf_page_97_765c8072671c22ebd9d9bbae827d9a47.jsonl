Chapter XVII
WHEN WENDY GREW UP
I hope you want to know what became of the other boys They
were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them and
when they had counted five hundred they went up They went up by
the stair because they thought this would make a better impression
They stood in a row in front of Mrs Darling with their hats off and
wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes They said
nothing but their eyes asked her to have them They ought to have
looked at Mr Darling also but they forgot about him
Of course Mrs Darling said at once that she would have them but
Mr Darling was curiously depressed and they saw that he
considered six a rather large number
I must say he said to Wendy that you dont do things by
halves a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at
them
The first twin was the proud one and he asked flushing Do you
think we should be too much of a handful sir Because if so we can
go away
Father Wendy cried shocked but still the cloud was on him
He knew he was behaving unworthily but he could not help it
We could lie doubled up said Nibs
I always cut their hair myself said Wendy
George Mrs Darling exclaimed pained to see her dear one
showing himself in such an unfavourable light
Then he burst into tears and the truth came out He was as glad to
have them as she was he said but he thought they should have asked
his consent as well as hers instead of treating him as a cypher in his
own house
I dont think he is a cypher Tootles cried instantly Do you
think he is a cypher Curly
No I dont Do you think he is a cypher Slightly
Rather not Twin what do you think
It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher and he
was absurdly gratified and said he would find space for them all in
the drawingroom if they fitted in
Well fit in sir they assured him
Then follow the leader he cried gaily Mind you I am not sure
that we have a drawingroom but we pretend we have and its all
the same Hoop la
He went off dancing through the house and they all cried Hoop
la and danced after him searching for the drawingroom and I
forget whether they found it but at any rate they found corners and
they all fitted in
