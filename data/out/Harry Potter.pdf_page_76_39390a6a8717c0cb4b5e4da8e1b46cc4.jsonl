Great idea though thanks Mom
Its not funny And look after Ron
Dont worry ickle Ronniekins is safe with us
Shut up said Ron again He was almost as tall as the twins already
and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it
Hey Mom guess what Guess who we just met on the train
Harry leaned back quickly so they couldnt see him looking
You know that blackhaired boy who was near us in the station Know who
he is
Who
Harry Potter
Harry heard the little girls voice
Oh Mom can I go on the train and see him Mom eh please
Youve already seen him Ginny and the poor boy isnt something you
goggle at in a zoo Is he really Fred How do you know
Asked him Saw his scar Its really there  like lightning
Poor dear  no wonder he was alone I wondered He was ever so polite
when he asked how to get onto the platform
Never mind that do you think he remembers what YouKnowWho looks
like
Their mother suddenly became very stern
I forbid you to ask him Fred No dont you dare As though he needs
reminding of that on his first day at school
All right keep your hair on
A whistle sounded
