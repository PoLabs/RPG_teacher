structures produced by adult sponges eg in the freshwater sponge Spongilla In gemmules an inner layer
of archeocytes amoebocytes is surrounded by a pneumatic cellular layer that may be reinforced with spicules
In freshwater sponges gemmules may survive hostile environmental conditions like changes in temperature
and then serve to recolonize the habitat once environmental conditions improve and stabilize Gemmules are
capable of attaching to a substratum and generating a new sponge Since gemmules can withstand harsh
environments are resistant to desiccation and remain dormant for long periods they are an excellent means of
colonization for a sessile organism
Sexual reproduction in sponges occurs when gametes are generated Oocytes arise by the differentiation of
amoebocytes and are retained within the spongocoel whereas spermatozoa result from the differentiation of
choanocytes and are ejected via the osculum Sponges are monoecious hermaphroditic which means that
one individual can produce both gametes eggs and sperm simultaneously In some sponges production of
gametes may occur throughout the year whereas other sponges may show sexual cycles depending upon water
temperature Sponges may also become sequentially hermaphroditic producing oocytes first and spermatozoa
later This temporal separation of gametes produced by the same sponge helps to encourage crossfertilization
and genetic diversity Spermatozoa carried along by water currents can fertilize the oocytes borne in the mesohyl
of other sponges Early larval development occurs within the sponge and freeswimming larvae such as
flagellated parenchymula are then released via the osculum
Locomotion
Sponges are generally sessile as adults and spend their lives attached to a fixed substratum They do not
show movement over large distances like other freeswimming marine invertebrates However sponge cells are
capable of creeping along substrata via organizational plasticity ie rearranging their cells Under experimental
conditions researchers have shown that sponge cells spread on a physical support demonstrate a leading edge
for directed movement It has been speculated that this localized creeping movement may help sponges adjust
to microenvironments near the point of attachment It must be noted however that this pattern of movement has
been documented in laboratories it remains to be observed in natural sponge habitats

282  Phylum Cnidaria
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Compare structural and organization characteristics of Porifera and Cnidaria

Describe the progressive development of tissues and their relevance to animal complexity

Identify the two general body forms found in the Cnidaria

Describe the identifying features of the major cnidarian classes
Phylum Cnidaria includes animals that exhibit radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic meaning that
they develop from two embryonic layers ectoderm and endoderm Nearly all about 99 percent cnidarians are
marine species
Whereas the defining cell type for the sponges is the choanocyte the defining cell type for the cnidarians is the
cnidocyte or stinging cell These cells are located around the mouth and on the tentacles and serve to capture
prey or repel predators Cnidocytes have large stinging organelles called nematocysts which usually contain
barbs at the base of a long coiled thread The outer wall of the cell has a hairlike projection called a cnidocil
which is sensitive to tactile stimulation If the cnidocils are touched the hollow threads evert with enormous
