At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a
pink silk dress
Password she said Caput Draconis said Percy and the portrait
swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall They all scrambled
through it  Neville needed a leg up  and found themselves in the
Gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairs
Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the
boys through another At the top of a spiral staircase  they were
obviously in one of the towers  they found their beds at last five
fourposters hung with deep red velvet curtains Their trunks had
already been brought up Too tired to talk much they pulled on their
pajamas and fell into bed
 Great food isnt it Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings
Get off Scabbers Hes chewing my sheets
Harry was going to ask Ron if hed had any of the treacle tart but he
fell asleep almost at once
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange
dream He was wearing Professor Quirrells turban which kept talking to
him telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once because it was
his destiny Harry told the turban he didnt want to be in Slytherin it
got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened

became high and cold  there was a burst of green light and Harry woke
sweating and shaking
He rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he
didnt remember the dream at all
