454  Population Dynamics and Regulation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Give examples of how the carrying capacity of a habitat may change

Compare and contrast densitydependent growth regulation and densityindependent growth regulation
giving examples

Give examples of exponential and logistic growth in wild animal populations

Describe how natural selection and environmental adaptation leads to the evolution of particular life
history patterns
The logistic model of population growth while valid in many natural populations and a useful model is a
simplification of realworld population dynamics Implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the
environment does not change which is not the case The carrying capacity varies annually for example some
summers are hot and dry whereas others are cold and wet In many areas the carrying capacity during the winter
is much lower than it is during the summer Also natural events such as earthquakes volcanoes and fires can
alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity Additionally populations do not usually exist in isolation
They engage in interspecific competition that is they share the environment with other species competing for
the same resources These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow
Nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways These are grouped into densitydependent factors in
which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality and densityindependent
factors which influence mortality in a population regardless of population density Note that in the former
the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at onset Conservation
biologists want to understand both types because this helps them manage populations and prevent extinction or
overpopulation
DensityDependent Regulation
Most densitydependent factors are biological in nature biotic and include predation inter and intraspecific
competition accumulation of waste and diseases such as those caused by parasites Usually the denser
a population is the greater its mortality rate For example during intra and interspecific competition the
reproductive rates of the individuals will usually be lower reducing their populations rate of growth In addition
low prey density increases the mortality of its predator because it has more difficulty locating its food source
An example of densitydependent regulation is shown in Figure 4511 with results from a study focusing on
the giant intestinal roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides a parasite of humans and other mammals

Denser
populations of the parasite exhibited lower fecundity they contained fewer eggs One possible explanation for
this is that females would be smaller in more dense populations due to limited resources and that smaller
females would have fewer eggs This hypothesis was tested and disproved in a 2009 study which showed that
female weight had no influence

The actual cause of the densitydependence of fecundity in this organism is
still unclear and awaiting further investigation
