should have heard him
I dont know I dont knowbecause at first he wanted to try and lure me in
again I suppose and now perhaps because he is waiting till after tonights hunt
or because he does not want to damage his bedroom if he can help itbut I wish
you would not argue Smaug will be coming out at any minute now and our only
hope is to get well in the tunnel and shut the door
He seemed so much in earnest that the dwarves at last did as he said though
they delayed shutting the doorit seemed a desperate plan for no one knew
whether or how they could get it open again from the inside and the thought of
being shut in a place from which the only way out led through the dragons lair
was not one they liked Also everything seemed quite quiet both outside and
down the tunnel So for a longish while they sat inside not far down from the
halfopen door and went on talking
The talk turned to the dragons wicked words about the dwarves Bilbo
wished he had never heard them or at least that he could feel quite certain that
the dwarves now were absolutely honest when they declared that they had never
thought at all about what would happen after the treasure had been won We
knew it would be a desperate venture said Thorin and we know that still and
I still think that when we have won it will be time enough to think what to do
about it As for your share Mr Baggins I assure you we are more than grateful
and you shall choose your own fourteenth as soon as we have anything to
divide I am sorry if you are worried about transport and I admit the difficulties
are greatthe lands have not become less wild with the passing of time rather
the reversebut we will do whatever we can for you and take our share of the
cost when the time comes Believe me or not as you like
From that the talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that Thorin
and Balin remembered They wondered if they were still lying there unharmed in
the hall below the spears that were made for the armies of the great King
Bladorthin long since dead each had a thriceforged head and their shafts were
inlaid with cunning gold but they were never delivered or paid for shields made
for warriors long dead the great golden cup of Thror twohanded hammered
and carven with birds and flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels coats of
mail gilded and silvered and impenetrable the necklace of Girion Lord of Dale
made of five hundred emeralds green as grass which he gave for the arming of
his eldest son in a coat of dwarflinked rings the like of which had never been
made before for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple
steel But fairest of all was the great white gem which the dwarves had found
