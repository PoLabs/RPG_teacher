O Tink did you drink it to save me
Yes
But why Tink
Her wings would scarcely carry her now but in reply she alighted
on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite She whispered in his
ear You silly ass and then tottering to her chamber lay down on
the bed
His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt
near her in distress Every moment her light was growing fainter and
he knew that if it went out she would be no more She liked his tears
so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she
said Then he made it out She was saying that she thought she could
get well again if children believed in fairies
Peter flung out his arms There were no children there and it was
night time but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the
Neverland and who were therefore nearer to him than you think
boys and girls in their nighties and naked papooses in their baskets

She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative and then again
she wasnt sure
What do you think she asked Peter
If you believe he shouted to them clap your hands dont let

Tink was saved First her voice grew strong then she popped out of
bed then she was flashing through the room more merry and
impudent than ever She never thought of thanking those who
believed but she would have liked to get at the ones who had hissed
And now to rescue Wendy

perilous quest It was not such a night as he would have chosen He
had hoped to fly keeping not far from the ground so that nothing
unwonted should escape his eyes but in that fitful light to have
flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees
thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir
He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such
strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach
There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion
at which happily he was an adept But in what direction for he could
not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship A light fall
of snow had obliterated all footmarks and a deathly silence pervaded
the island as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of the recent
