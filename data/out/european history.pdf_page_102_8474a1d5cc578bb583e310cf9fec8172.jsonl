agricultural cultivation Some emigrants however were not destitute at all 
as emigration required investments In several cases people sold their houses 
or landed property in order to finance their trip and establish themselves in 
the Americas These more enterprising types were seeking the opportunity 
to improve their status and accumulate savings overseas which could also be 
invested back home Such intentions seem to be confirmed by noticeable rates 
of remigration some migrants in fact travelled back and forth between the 
United States and Eastern or Southern Europe two or three times
Beyond such economic motives decisions to emigrateand more 
importantly the choice of country and region to which to migratewere 
made on the basis of a wide range of other parameters which together shaped 
a global migration system One important factor was the deliberate policies 
of European states to facilitate migration via financial and practical support 
for example or through direct deportation In most cases these policies were 
the product of a desire to be relieved of the burden of poor unproductive or 
criminalised citizens Another important factor influencing the destiny of 
migrants were the policies of the receiving country For instance migration to 
the USA only took off after an Indiana court in 1821 banned the redemption 
system in which destitute migrants were forced into bondage after they had 
to borrow money to enter the country Similarly migration to Australia was 
stimulated by the Londonbased Australian Colonial Land and Emigration 
Commission 
Perhaps even more important for the decision of where to migrate were 
family ties and local communities From connections to preceding pioneer 
migrants in communities such as these aspiring emigrants received information 
about the requirements of travel and practical support once they arrived at 
their destination They received crucial information about prospects of work 
again conditioned by contacts with earlier migrants in the same profession 
or trade And as these interconnections created forms of chain migration
of one group following anothermigrants also remained connected to the 
national communities they had left behind contributing to the emergence 
of nationally defined immigrant communities that only partially assimilated 
into a new national identity Many of these migrant communities were also 
geographically clustered the Irish in Boston the German Belt between Ohio 
Nebraska Wisconsin and Missouri the Dutch who established Holland in 
Michigan This continued interaction between homeland and host country 
also allowed for the possibility of a future return to Europe Numbers varied 
dramatically no more than five percent of all Jewish immigrants to the USA 
returned to Europe while eightynine percent of the Bulgarians and Serbians
