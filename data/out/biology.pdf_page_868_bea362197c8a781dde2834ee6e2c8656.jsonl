Figure 2911 A placoderm Dunkleosteus was an enormous placoderm from the Devonian period 380 to 360 million
years ago It measured up to 10 meters in length and weighed up to 36 tons Its head and neck were armored with
heavy bony plates Although Dunkleosteus had no true teeth the edge of the jaw was armed with sharp bony blades

Class Chondrichthyes Cartilaginous Fishes
The class Chondrichthyes about 1000 species is a morphologically diverse clade consisting of subclass
Elasmobranchii sharks Figure 2912 rays and skates together with the obscure and critically endangered
sawfishes and a few dozen species of fishes called chimaeras or ghost sharks in the subclass Holocephali
Chondrichthyes are jawed fishes that possess paired fins and a skeleton made of cartilage This clade arose
approximately 370 million years ago in the early or middle Devonian They are thought to be descended from the
placoderms which had endoskeletons made of bone thus the lighter cartilaginous skeleton of Chondrichthyes
is a secondarily derived evolutionary development Parts of shark skeleton are strengthened by granules of
calcium carbonate but this is not the same as bone
Most cartilaginous fishes live in marine habitats with a few species living in fresh water for a part or all of their
lives Most sharks are carnivores that feed on live prey either swallowing it whole or using their jaws and teeth to
tear it into smaller pieces Sharks have abrasive skin covered with toothlike scales called placoid scales Shark
teeth probably evolved from rows of these scales lining the mouth A few species of sharks and rays like the
enormous whale shark Figure 2913 are suspension feeders that feed on plankton The sawfishes have an
extended rostrum that looks like a doubleedged saw The rostrum is covered with electrosensitive pores that
allow the sawfish to detect slight movements of prey hiding in the muddy sea floor The teeth in the rostrum are
actually modified toothlike structures called denticles similar to scales

Sharks have welldeveloped sense organs that aid them in locating prey including a keen sense of smell and
the ability to detect electromagnetic fields Electroreceptors called ampullae of Lorenzini allow sharks to detect
the electromagnetic fields that are produced by all living things including their prey Electroreception has only
been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals and sharks have perhaps the most sensitive electroreceptors
