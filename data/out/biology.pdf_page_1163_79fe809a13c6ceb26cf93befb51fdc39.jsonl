The Dangers of Synthetic Hormones

Some athletes attempt to boost their performance by using artificial hormones that enhance muscle
performance Anabolic steroids a form of the male sex hormone testosterone are one of the most widely
known performanceenhancing drugs Steroids are used to help build muscle mass Other hormones that
are used to enhance athletic performance include erythropoietin which triggers the production of red blood
cells and human growth hormone which can help in building muscle mass Most performance enhancing
drugs are illegal for nonmedical purposes They are also banned by national and international governing
bodies including the International Olympic Committee the US Olympic Committee the National Collegiate
Athletic Association the Major League Baseball and the National Football League
The side effects of synthetic hormones are often significant and nonreversible and in some cases fatal
Androgens produce several complications such as liver dysfunctions and liver tumors prostate gland
enlargement difficulty urinating premature closure of epiphyseal cartilages testicular atrophy infertility and
immune system depression The physiological strain caused by these substances is often greater than what
the body can handle leading to unpredictable and dangerous effects and linking their use to heart attacks
strokes and impaired cardiac function
Regulation of the Female Reproductive System
In females FSH stimulates development of egg cells called ova which develop in structures called follicles
Follicle cells produce the hormone inhibin which inhibits FSH production LH also plays a role in the
development of ova induction of ovulation and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the
ovaries as illustrated in Figure 379 Estradiol and progesterone are steroid hormones that prepare the body for
pregnancy Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females while both estradiol and progesterone
regulate the menstrual cycle
