vibration

proprioception position of bones joints and muscles and the sense of limb position that is used to track
kinesthesia limb movement are part of somatosensation Although the sensory systems associated with
these senses are very different all share a common function to convert a stimulus such as light or sound
or the position of the body into an electrical signal in the nervous system This process is called sensory
transduction
There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction In one a neuron works with
a sensory receptor a cell or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus
Stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron which carries information about
the stimulus to the central nervous system In the second type of sensory transduction a sensory nerve ending
responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment this neuron constitutes the sensory receptor Free
nerve endings can be stimulated by several different stimuli thus showing little receptor specificity For example
pain receptors in your gums and teeth may be stimulated by temperature changes chemical stimulation or
pressure
Reception
The first step in sensation is reception which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as
mechanical stimuli being bent or squished for example chemicals or temperature The receptor can then
respond to the stimuli The region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus be it
far away or in contact with the body is that receptors receptive field Think for a moment about the differences
in receptive fields for the different senses For the sense of touch a stimulus must come into contact with the
body For the sense of hearing a stimulus can be a moderate distance away some baleen whale sounds can
propagate for many kilometers For vision a stimulus can be very far away for example the visual system
perceives light from stars at enormous distances
Transduction
The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal
in the nervous system This takes place at the sensory receptor and the change in electrical potential that is
produced is called the receptor potential How is sensory input such as pressure on the skin changed to a
receptor potential In this example a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor as shown in Figure 362
possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing
them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron changing
its electrical potential Recall that in the nervous system a positive change of a neurons electrical potential
also called the membrane potential depolarizes the neuron Receptor potentials are graded potentials the
magnitude of these graded receptor potentials varies with the strength of the stimulus If the magnitude of
depolarization is sufficient that is if membrane potential reaches a threshold the neuron will fire an action
potential In most cases the correct stimulus impinging on a sensory receptor will drive membrane potential in a
positive direction although for some receptors such as those in the visual system this is not always the case
