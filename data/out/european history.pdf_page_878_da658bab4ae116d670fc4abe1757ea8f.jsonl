special position In her seminal two volume work The Printing Press as an 
Agent of Change published in 1979 and influenced by McLuhan the American 
historian Elisabeth Eisenstein examines the enormous consequences of the 
printing press for Western civilisation Eisenstein systematically explores the 
consequences of the shift from manuscript to print culture and argues that 
printing brought revolutionary change in communication in early modern 
Europe The dissemination and standardisation of texts and books and their 
increasing availability at lower prices enabled a wider reading public to have 
access to information and knowledge above and beyond what was possible 
during medieval times In addition printing contributed to the social success 
of the Reformation the Renaissance and also the Scientific Revolution all 
of which played a fundamental role in shaping the history of the modern 
world In short the introduction of the printing press was not just a technical 
development it laid the foundation for modern Western communication
Eisensteins theory provoked heated academic debates and she undoubtedly 
drew attention to major and farreaching cultural changes Contemporaries in 
the sixteenth century themselves acknowledged the importance of Gutenbergs 
invention Martin Luther and other Protestant thinkers suggested that the

to address housewives at home children in the street and common people in 
the marketplace He talked to the people and also understood that he had to 
listen to them in order to successfully spread his novel ideas on religion

Europe a network emerged which produced books at cheaper prices which 
led to the rapid popularisation of the written word Owning books became 
commonplace for many Europeans At the same time the translation of the Bible 
into vernacular languages had powerful consequences for communication 
culture and literacy all over Europe
In their classic work The Coming of the Book 1958 the French historians 
Lucien Febvre and HenriJean Martin examined patterns of book ownership 
and the reading habits of the lower classes Building on Febvre and Martins 
work recent scholarship has refined our knowledge of popular reading 
habits in wider cultural contexts In addition to the question of what ordinary 
people read historians explored how they read the written word and how they 
purchased books The French historian Roger Chartier suggests that peasants 
trading folks and artisans often had access to texts which had not originally 
been produced for them they consumed the same readings as members of
