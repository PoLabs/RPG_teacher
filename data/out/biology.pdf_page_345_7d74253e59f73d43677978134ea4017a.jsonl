Several conventions exist for referring to genes and alleles For the purposes of this chapter we will abbreviate
genes using the first letter of the genes corresponding dominant trait For example violet is the dominant trait
for a pea plants flower color so the flowercolor gene would be abbreviated as V note that it is customary to
italicize gene designations Furthermore we will use uppercase and lowercase letters to represent dominant
and recessive alleles respectively Therefore we would refer to the genotype of a homozygous dominant pea
plant with violet flowers as VV a homozygous recessive pea plant with white flowers as vv and a heterozygous
pea plant with violet flowers as Vv
The Punnett Square Approach for a Monohybrid Cross
When fertilization occurs between two truebreeding parents that differ in only one characteristic the process is
called a monohybrid cross and the resulting offspring are monohybrids Mendel performed seven monohybrid
crosses involving contrasting traits for each characteristic On the basis of his results in F1 and F2 generations
Mendel postulated that each parent in the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each
offspring and every possible combination of unit factors was equally likely
To demonstrate a monohybrid cross consider the case of truebreeding pea plants with yellow versus green pea
seeds The dominant seed color is yellow therefore the parental genotypes were YY for the plants with yellow
seeds and yy for the plants with green seeds respectively A Punnett square devised by the British geneticist
Reginald Punnett can be drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic
cross or mating and their expected frequencies To prepare a Punnett square all possible combinations of the
parental alleles are listed along the top for one parent and side for the other parent of a grid representing
their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes Then the combinations of egg and sperm are made in the boxes
in the table to show which alleles are combining Each box then represents the diploid genotype of a zygote or
fertilized egg that could result from this mating Because each possibility is equally likely genotypic ratios can be
determined from a Punnett square If the pattern of inheritance dominant or recessive is known the phenotypic
ratios can be inferred as well For a monohybrid cross of two truebreeding parents each parent contributes one
type of allele In this case only one genotype is possible All offspring are Yy and have yellow seeds Figure
