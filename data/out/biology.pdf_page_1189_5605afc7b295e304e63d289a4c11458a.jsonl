Introduction
The muscular and skeletal systems provide support to the body and allow for a wide range of movement The
bones of the skeletal system protect the bodys internal organs and support the weight of the body The muscles
of the muscular system contract and pull on the bones allowing for movements as diverse as standing walking
running and grasping items
Injury or disease affecting the musculoskeletal system can be very debilitating In humans the most common
musculoskeletal diseases worldwide are caused by malnutrition Ailments that affect the joints are also
widespread such as arthritis which can make movement difficult andin advanced casescompletely impair
mobility In severe cases in which the joint has suffered extensive damage joint replacement surgery may be
needed
Progress in the science of prosthesis design has resulted in the development of artificial joints with joint
