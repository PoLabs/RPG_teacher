talk about But for those in trade news became an ever more important aspect 
of doing business Especially in the volatile world of international shipping 
information could make the difference between profit or bankruptcy It is 
therefore hardly surprising that the early modern newspaperusually a two
sided sheet with the latest news on wars international politics prices of goods 
and shipping arrivalsfirst developed in large trading hubs such as Spain 
and the Italian citystates and later in Hamburg and Frankfurt the cities of 
the Dutch Republic and London These newspapers were based on the earlier 
handwritten news updates that traders received from private correspondents 
abroad Now a local courantier collected these letters composed and printed 
themusually twice per week but in some cases even more often
During the seventeenth century highquality newspapers especially Dutch 
ones were sold in bookshops across Europe They were readily available in 
large cities but in the more urbanised coastal areas peddlers would also bring 
them to smaller hamlets An eighteenthcentury traveller could find a variety 
of recent newspapers available in a tavern in a remote settlement of the marshy 
southern parts of the Dutch Republic And even if the original newspapers 
were not available just as often people could take note of the latest news via 
local newspapers that copiedrather shamelesslythe columns of others 
Thus the same news became known far across state borders between 1450 
and 1650 an international network of news had developed
By the eighteenth century some courantiers aimed their newspapers at 
this international audience Their French newspapers often published in the 
larger cities of the Dutch Republic were read across Europe and beyond The 
Gazette de Leyde for instance was read from Washington to Istanbul Although 
newspaper editors catered for an educated audience newspapers were cheap 
enough to be within reach of the middle and working classes as well As 
mentioned above in Europe literacy was higher than previously assumed and 
those who could not read would wait for someone to come by and read texts 
aloud either in taverns in the streets or at the door Even though print runs 
were smaller than for later nineteenthcentury newspapers the reader base 
for early modern newspapers was thus quite extensive In urbanised areas 
newspapers were read from the smallest towns to the largest cities and by 
the second half of the eighteenth century most of the people in the Western 
world had access to the same news about important international and national 
events either through the original newspaper or via a local paper
The importance of the transnational character of early modern news is 
exemplified by the spread of the Atlantic Revolutions of the late eighteenth 
century in fact without early modern news the Atlantic Revolutions would 
be hard to explain People in the Dutch Republic followed occurrences in the 
Thirteen Colonies across the Atlantic through the Gazette de Leyde That same
