Introduction
All living organisms need nutrients to survive While plants can obtain the molecules required for cellular
function through the process of photosynthesis most animals obtain their nutrients by the consumption of
other organisms At the cellular level the biological molecules necessary for animal function are amino acids
lipid molecules nucleotides and simple sugars However the food consumed consists of protein fat and
complex carbohydrates Animals must convert these macromolecules into the simple molecules required for
maintaining cellular functions such as assembling new molecules cells and tissues The conversion of the food
consumed to the nutrients required is a multistep process involving digestion and absorption During digestion
food particles are broken down to smaller components and later they are absorbed by the body
One of the challenges in human nutrition is maintaining a balance between food intake storage and energy
