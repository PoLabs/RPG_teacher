While the necessity for cellular communication in larger organisms seems obvious even singlecelled organisms
communicate with each other Yeast cells signal each other to aid in finding other yeast cells for reproduction
Some forms of bacteria coordinate their actions in order to form large complexes called biofilms or to organize
the production of toxins to remove competing organisms The ability of cells to communicate through chemical
signals originated in single cells and was essential for the evolution of multicellular organisms The efficient and
relatively errorfree function of communication systems is vital for all life as we know it
91  Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe four types of signaling mechanisms found in multicellular organisms

Compare internal receptors with cellsurface receptors

Recognize the relationship between a ligands structure and its mechanism of action
There are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells Communication between cells is called
intercellular signaling and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling An easy way to
remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes inter means between for
example intersecting lines are those that cross each other and intra means inside as in intravenous
Chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small usually volatile or soluble molecules called
ligands A ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule in some cases delivering a signal in the
process Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules Ligands interact with proteins in target cells
which are cells that are affected by chemical signals these proteins are also called receptors Ligands and
receptors exist in several varieties however a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds
only that ligand
Forms of Signaling
There are four categories of chemical signaling found in multicellular organisms paracrine signaling endocrine
signaling autocrine signaling and direct signaling across gap junctions Figure 92 The main difference
between the different categories of signaling is the distance that the signal travels through the organism to reach
the target cell We should note here that not all cells are affected by the same signals
