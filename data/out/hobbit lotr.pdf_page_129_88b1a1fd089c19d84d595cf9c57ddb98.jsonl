Old fat spider spinning in a tree
Old fat spider cant see me
    Attercop Attercop
        Wont you stop
Stop your spinning and look for me
Old Tomnoddy all big body
Old Tomnoddy cant spy me
    Attercop Attercop
        Down you drop
Youll never catch me up your tree
Not very good perhaps but then you must remember that he had to make it
up himself on the spur of a very awkward moment It did what he wanted any
way As he sang he threw some more stones and stamped Practically all the
spiders in the place came after him some dropped to the ground others raced
along the branches swung from tree to tree or cast new ropes across the dark
spaces They made for his noise far quicker than he had expected They were
frightfully angry Quite apart from the stones no spider has ever liked being
called Attercop and Tomnoddy of course is insulting to anybody
Off Bilbo scuttled to a fresh place but several of the spiders had run now to
different points in the glade where they lived and were busy spinning webs
across all the spaces between the treestems Very soon the hobbit would be
caught in a thick fence of them all round himthat at least was the spiders idea
Standing now in the middle of the hunting and spinning insects Bilbo plucked up
his courage and began a new song
Lazy Lob and crazy Cob
are weaving webs to wind me
I am far more sweet than other meat
but still they cannot find me
Here am I naughty little fly
you are fat and lazy
