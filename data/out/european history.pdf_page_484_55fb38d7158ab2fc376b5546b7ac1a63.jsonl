contributed to the gradual evolution of broader and tighter networks of social 
relations Western monarchies overcame traditional localism and assumed an 
increasing share of competence and power also in the social sphere 
Charity and Religion
In Christian communities both religious and private giving were based 
on the concept of Christian charity This concept was rooted in biblical 
commands for mutual responsibility and the readiness to help the needy 
Poverty and sharing were also Christian ideals Since the Middle Ages love 
of the neighbour had been closely related to the love of God acts of charity 
had been regarded as a visible expression of faith Charity had been extended 
mainly through hospices refuges and almsgiving Women had gained some 
degree of influence in distributing poor relief through the charitable work of 
monasteries One important purpose of charitable acts had been to promote 
to the donors salvation through beneficients prayers This changed with the 
Reformation when Luther extolled charity as a spontaneous expression of 
love for the neighbour without which there could be no love of God The 
Protestant communities that emerged from the Reformation subsequently 
interpreted charity slightly differently Lutherans tended to rely more on 
secular authorities than Calvinists
Jewish people had neither access to the relief provided by secular authorities 
nor to that offered by the Christian churches Hence Jewish communities 
organised and funded their own system of poor relief coordinated through 
synagogues Jewish poor relief was based on the principle of tzedakah the 
religious obligation to act righteously In continental Europe Jewish people 
were required to house and feed travellers and the travelling poor in exchange 
for written vouchers Pletten regularly submitted to the synagogues by each 
household Despite this system the Jewish population was disproportionately 
affected by the growing poverty towards the end of the early modern period 
due to its exclusion from many trades
Charitable activities that were motivated by religious principles sometimes 
undermined secular attempts at rationalising communalising and regulating 
poor relief By contrast pietism a religious movement that originated in the 
seventeenth century championed cooperation between state authorities and 
Protestant communities especially with regard to education

demanded universal schooling As early as the sixteenth century compulsory
