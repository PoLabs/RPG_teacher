Figure 1516 Translation begins when an initiator tRNA anticodon recognizes a start codon on mRNA bound to
a small ribosomal subunit The large ribosomal subunit joins the small subunit and a second tRNA is recruited
As the mRNA moves relative to the ribosome successive tRNAs move through the ribosome and the polypeptide
chain is formed Entry of a release factor into the A site terminates translation and the components dissociate
Many antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis For example tetracycline blocks the A site on the
bacterial ribosome and chloramphenicol blocks peptidyl transfer What specific effect would you expect
each of these antibiotics to have on protein synthesis
Tetracycline would directly affect
a
tRNA binding to the ribosome
b
ribosome assembly
c
growth of the protein chain
Chloramphenicol would directly affect
a
tRNA binding to the ribosome
b
ribosome assembly
c
growth of the protein chain
Termination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon UAA UAG or UGA is encountered Upon aligning
with the A site these nonsense codons are recognized by protein release factors that resemble tRNAs The
releasing factors in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes instruct peptidyl transferase to add a water molecule to
the carboxyl end of the Psite amino acid This reaction forces the Psite amino acid to detach from its tRNA
and the newly made protein is released The small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mRNA and
