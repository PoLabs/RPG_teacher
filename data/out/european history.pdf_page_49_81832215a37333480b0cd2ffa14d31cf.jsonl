11 IDEAS OF EUROPE

The 1930s and the Second World War
The fragile blossoming of the European idea during the 1920sfounded on 
the pillars of a common culture pacifism and economic unificationwas 
crushed first by the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 and the exacerbation 
of protectionism that had already been present in the previous decade and 
then by the rise of nationalism and the strengthening of authoritarian fascist 
and Nazi regimesa process that had begun in EastCentral Europe as early 
as the 1920s 
Conservative designs of Europe in the 1920s and 30s often combined anti
American and antiBolshevik sentiments with an elitist and hierarchical social 
model For example the Abendland Occident movement most influential in 
Germany but with ties to France envisioned Europe as a Christian Catholic 
unity dominated by the German and French nations and with a social structure 
inspired by the Middle Ages Such plans were revealing in that they reflected 
primarily on the question of which role Germany might play in a unified

territory 
With the exception of the Lebensraum concept which the Nazi authorities 
began to enforce during the Second World War National Socialist ideals of

necessity of the Third Reichs dominance in Europe and of the reconstruction 
of the occupied European states according to the German model Thuswith 
Hitlers attempt to reclaim the European idea by linking it to an antiSemitic 
and antiBolshevik Neuordnung Rearrangement usually referred to as New 
Orderthe period after the 1920s was a very dark one for supporters of a 
united Europe
While there were attempts by Britain and France to develop trade and 
to establish closer contact with the nations beyond Germany ie in East
Central Europe these plans failed For example the socalled Tardieu Plan 
proposed in 1932 by the French prime minister Andr Tardieu 18761945
