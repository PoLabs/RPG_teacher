Designing for multiple screen sizes 
Designing a site that will display consistently across multiple devices and screen sizes is 
difficultbut understanding and sticking to web standards will bring you closer to this goal

get to The limited screen space is valuable so you cant necessarily have the full site navigation 
on every page Well thoughtout information architecture is essential ensuring that you make 
the most logical use of navigation in line with what your site visitors need

a site optimised across a variety of devices However the process is certainly worth it There 
are 47 billion unique mobile subscribers and the majority of these are accessing the mobile
