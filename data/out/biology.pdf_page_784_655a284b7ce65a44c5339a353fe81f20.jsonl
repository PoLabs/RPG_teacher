to the two poles of the embryo Deuterostomes undergo radial cleavage where the cleavage axes are either
parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis resulting in the parallel upanddown alignment of the cells between
the two poles
Figure 2711 Protostomes and deuterostomes Eucoelomates can be divided into two groups based on their early
embryonic development In protostomes the mouth forms at or near the site of the blastopore and the body cavity
forms by splitting the mesodermal mass during the process of schizocoely In deuterostomes the mouth forms at a
site opposite the blastopore end of the embryo and the mesoderm pinches off to form the coelom during the process
of enterocoely
A second distinction between the types of cleavage in protostomes and deuterostomes relates to the fate of the
resultant blastomeres cells produced by cleavage In addition to spiral cleavage protostomes also undergo
determinate cleavage This means that even at this early stage the developmental fate of each embryonic
cell is already determined A given cell does not have the ability to develop into any cell type other than its
original destination Removal of a blastomere from an embryo with determinate cleavage can result in missing
structures and embryos that fail to develop In contrast deuterostomes undergo indeterminate cleavage in
which cells are not yet fully committed at this early stage to develop into specific cell types Removal of individual
blastomeres from these embryos does not result in the loss of embryonic structures In fact twins clones
can be produced as a result from blastomeres that have been separated from the original mass of blastomere
cells Unlike protostomes however if some blastomeres are damaged during embryogenesis adjacent cells
are able to compensate for the missing cells and the embryo is not damaged These cells are referred to as
undetermined cells This characteristic of deuterostomes is reflected in the existence of familiar embryonic stem
cells which have the ability to develop into any cell type until their fate is programmed at a later developmental
stage
