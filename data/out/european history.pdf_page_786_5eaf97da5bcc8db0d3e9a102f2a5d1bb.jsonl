It was only under Catherine II 17621796 that the central grip became more 
tangible after a series of reforms and territorial reorganisations which also 
defined the responsibilities and rights of towns provinces and districts By 
the late eighteenth century the empire had abolished or violently displaced 
most formerly autonomous formations on the frontier including the Cossack 
settlements Still central rule remained territorialised in that many central laws 
were made applicable only to specific regions such as the western provinces 
the Volga region and so on As a result the situation of a particular group 
of subjects for example Muslims merchants of the first guild or peasants 
on state lands could be vastly different depending on where they lived 
Administrative centralisation did not deliver legal uniformity 
Territorial expansion and organisation were key to centreperiphery 
relations in Russia Assemblies and popular representation were less central 
to the development of these relations than in France Germany and elsewhere 
in Europe The Duma an advisory organ with no formal powers that included 
between one and two dozen nobles boyars from the most important 
families in Muscovite society was regularly summoned to consolidate the 
legitimacy of and popular support for the Tsars decisions It coexisted with a 
larger central institution called zemskii sobor assembly of the land which the 
tsars convened every few years between 1549 and 1684 for the same reasons 
Historians differ on the question of the assemblys composition but at 
different times it included boyars provincial governors lower gentry Russian 
Orthodox clergy townsfolk and peasants This central institution however 
did not systematically channel regional interests With few exceptions such 
as the Baltic provinces which were allowed to retain their Germanspeaking 
Landtage after the Russian conquest in 1710 there were no regional assemblies 
or parliaments recognised by the centre It was only in 1766 that Catherine II 
introduced noble assemblies at the provincial and district levels and allowed 
them to look into local matters In 17671768 she convened a Legislative 
Commission in Moscow and St Petersburg to produce a new legal code with 
delegates representing many social groups and regions bearing instructions 
from those who had locally selected them Yet this advisory commission 
never produced any substantive laws or codes it was significant mainly in 
that it provided the Empress with information on local concerns 
The idea of three distinct estates in a Western European sense clergy 
nobility common people fails to capture the reallife hierarchies of early 
modern Russia Other categories had greater legal impact polltax payers for 
example a category from which not only clergymen and higher nobility were 
exempted but also rich merchants and many nonRussian rural residents lesser 
nobles and bureaucrats by contrast often had to pay this tax along with most 
commoners Among the clergy and nobility it also mattered whether someone
