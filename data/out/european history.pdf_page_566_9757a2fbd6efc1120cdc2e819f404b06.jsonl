At the end of the nineteenth century imperial ideas about the natural 
environment as an interconnected system were transported to the European 
core and converged with Gilbert Whites arcadian view of nature and concerns 
over the environmental effects of industrialisation Two broader developments 
led to the foundation of the first nature conservation organisations in Britain 
and elsewhere First following the example of Gilbert White and paradoxically 
facilitated by the invention of the steam locomotive that connected urban 
areas with the surrounding countryside natural history became a popular 
pastime in Victorian Britain The study and observation of nature by amateur 
field naturalists who escaped overcrowded and polluted cities in search of 
tranquillity and wonder in turn stimulated a desire to protect rare plant and 
animal species and ultimately the landscape as a whole Second as part of a 
larger civilising movement middleclass reformers including many women 
started a campaign against cruelty to animals Members of the bourgeois 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals founded in 1824 believed 
that cruelty to animals like slavery and alcohol addiction stemmed from 
savage impulses that needed to be restrained They persuaded parliament to 
prohibit dog fights and to pass legislation protecting wildfowl and wild birds 
whose plumage was used for womens fashion 
Other European countries followed suit and after the foundation of the 
Society for the Protection of Birds in Britain 1889 the Bund fr Vogelschutz was 
established in Germany in 1899 In contrast to Britain however the German 
nature conservation movement inspired by romanticism and nationalism 
combined concerns over birds and plants with a concern for the preservation 
of cultural heritage and regional identities resulting in a nationallyoriented 
campaign to protect the German landscape Heimatschutz At the beginning 
of the twentieth century after the International Congress for the Protection 
of Nature in Paris 1909 national organisations established the foundations 
of a transnational nature protection network It was within this context that a 
sustainability discourse emerged 
Conclusion
The ways in which humankind controlled and understood the environment 
changed in the nineteenth century On the one hand the natural environment 
became an important scientific object which triggered new political 
economic and technological developments and opportunities With a better 
understanding of the natural world as a fragile ecosystem there emerged a 
need to take responsibility for the wellbeing of all species and habitats The 
idea to utilise nature in a more sustainable improved and economic way 
found its expression in the political need to regulate common resources like
