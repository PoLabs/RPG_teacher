Complex III
The third complex is composed of cytochrome banother FeS protein a Rieske center 2Fe2S center and
cytochrome c proteins This complex is also called cytochrome oxidoreductase Cytochrome proteins have a
prosthetic group of heme The heme molecule is similar to the heme in hemoglobin but it carries electrons not
oxygen As a result the iron ion at its core is reduced and oxidized as it passes the electrons fluctuating between
different oxidation states Fe reduced and Fe oxidized The heme molecules in the cytochromes have
slightly different characteristics due to the effects of the different proteins binding to them giving slightly different
characteristics to each complex Complex III pumps protons through the membrane and passes its electrons to
cytochrome c for transport to the fourth complex of proteins and enzymes Cytochrome c receives electrons
from Q however whereas Q carries pairs of electrons cytochrome c can accept only one at a time
Complex IV
The fourth complex is composed of cytochrome proteins c a and a3 This complex contains two heme groups
one in each of the two cytochromes a and a3 and three copper ions a pair of CuA and one CuB in cytochrome
a3 The cytochromes hold an oxygen molecule very tightly between the iron and copper ions until the oxygen is
completely reduced by the gain of two electrons The reduced oxygen then picks up two hydrogen ions from the
surrounding medium to make water H2O The removal of the hydrogen ions from the system contributes to the
ion gradient that forms the foundation for the process of chemiosmosis
Chemiosmosis
In chemiosmosis the free energy from the series of redox reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen
ions protons across the mitochondrial membrane The uneven distribution of H ions across the membrane
establishes both concentration and electrical gradients thus an electrochemical gradient owing to the
hydrogen ions positive charge and their aggregation on one side of the membrane
If the membrane were continuously open to simple diffusion by the hydrogen ions the ions would tend to
diffuse back across into the matrix driven by the concentrations producing their electrochemical gradient Recall
that many ions cannot diffuse through the nonpolar regions of phospholipid membranes without the aid of ion
channels Similarly hydrogen ions in the matrix space can only pass through the inner mitochondrial membrane
by an integral membrane protein called ATP synthase Figure 711 This complex protein acts as a tiny
generator turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing through it down their electrochemical gradient The
turning of parts of this molecular machine facilitates the addition of a phosphate to ADP forming ATP using the
potential energy of the hydrogen ion gradient
