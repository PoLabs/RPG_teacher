vernalization
first phase of female gametophyte development during which a single cell in the diploid
megasporangium undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores only one of which survives
bract a type of modified leaf on the central axis of a female gametophyte
middle part of a fruit
propagation of desirable plants from a plant part carried out in a laboratory
opening on the ovule sac through which the pollen tube can gain entry
tissue that gives rise to the microspores or the pollen grain
central axis of a male cone on which bracts a type of modified leaf are attached
plants that flower once in their lifetime
fruit that develops from multiple flowers on an inflorescence
pigment pattern on a flower that guides an insect to the nectaries
dicot that stores food reserves in the developing cotyledon
also petal or sepal part of the flower consisting of the calyx andor corolla forms the outer envelope
of the flower
collective term describing the exocarp mesocarp and endocarp the structure that encloses the seed
and is a part of the fruit
shoot that develops from the germinating seed
found in the ovule sac fusion with one sperm cell forms the endosperm
transfer of pollen to the stigma
plants that flower several times in their lifetime
original root that develops from the germinating seed
mechanical or chemical processes to soften the seed coat
the part of a plant that is grafted onto the root stock of another plant
type of cotyledon found in monocots as in grass seeds
transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower
process that describes aging in plant tissues
fruit that develops from a single carpel or fused carpels
multicellular diploid stage in plants that is formed after the fusion of male and female gametes
part of the growing embryo that makes connection with the maternal tissues
type of cell found in the ovule sac that secretes chemicals to guide the pollen tube towards the egg
inner layer of the seed coat
outer layer of the seed coat
exposure to cold required by some seeds before they can germinate
