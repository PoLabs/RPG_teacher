The last thing he ever said to me was Just always be waiting for
me and then some night you will hear me crowing
Yes
But alas he forgot all about me Wendy said it with a smile
She was as grown up as that
What did his crow sound like Jane asked one evening
It was like this Wendy said trying to imitate Peters crow
No it wasnt Jane said gravely it was like this and she did it
ever so much better than her mother
Wendy was a little startled My darling how can you know
I often hear it when I am sleeping Jane said
Ah yes many girls hear it when they are sleeping but I was the
only one who heard it awake
Lucky you said Jane
And then one night came the tragedy It was the spring of the year
and the story had been told for the night and Jane was now asleep in
her bed Wendy was sitting on the floor very close to the fire so as
to see to darn for there was no other light in the nursery and while
she sat darning she heard a crow Then the window blew open as of
old and Peter dropped in on the floor
He was exactly the same as ever and Wendy saw at once that he
still had all his first teeth
He was a little boy and she was grown up She huddled by the fire
not daring to move helpless and guilty a big woman
Hullo Wendy he said not noticing any difference for he was
thinking chiefly of himself and in the dim light her white dress
might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first
Hullo Peter she replied faintly squeezing herself as small as
possible Something inside her was crying Woman Woman let go
of me
Hullo where is John he asked suddenly missing the third bed
John is not here now she gasped
Is Michael asleep he asked with a careless glance at Jane
Yes she answered and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane
as well as to Peter
That is not Michael she said quickly lest a judgment should fall
on her
Peter looked Hullo is it a new one
Yes
Boy or girl
Girl
Now surely he would understand but not a bit of it
Peter she said faltering are you expecting me to fly away with
you
Of course that is why I have come He added a little sternly
Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time
She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring
cleaning times pass
