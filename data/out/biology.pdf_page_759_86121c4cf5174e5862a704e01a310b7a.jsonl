Monocots
Plants in the monocot group are primarily identified by the presence of a single cotyledon in the seedling Other
anatomical features shared by monocots include veins that run parallel to and along the length of the leaves and
flower parts that are arranged in a three or sixfold symmetry True woody tissue is rarely found in monocots
In palm trees vascular and parenchyma tissues produced by the primary and secondary thickening meristems
form the trunk The pollen from the first angiosperms was likely monosulcate containing a single furrow or
pore through the outer layer This feature is still seen in the modern monocots Vascular tissue of the stem is
scattered not arranged in any particular pattern but is organized in a ring in the roots The root system consists
of multiple fibrous roots with no major tap root Adventitious roots often emerge from the stem or leaves The
monocots include familiar plants such as the true lilies Liliopsida orchids yucca asparagus grasses and
palms Many important crops are monocots such as rice and other cereals corn sugar cane and tropical fruits
like bananas and pineapples Figure 2619abc
