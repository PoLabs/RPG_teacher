192  Population Genetics
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the different types of variation in a population

Explain why only natural selection can act upon heritable variation

Describe genetic drift and the bottleneck effect

Explain how each evolutionary force can influence a populations allele frequencies
A populations individuals often display different phenotypes or express different alleles of a particular gene
which scientists refer to as polymorphisms We call populations with two or more variations of particular
characteristics polymorphic A number of factors including the populations genetic structure and the
environment Figure 193 influence population variation the distribution of phenotypes among individuals
Understanding phenotypic variation sources in a population is important for determining how a population will
evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures

Genetic Variance
Natural selection and some of the other evolutionary forces can only act on heritable traits namely an organisms
genetic code Because alleles are passed from parent to offspring those that confer beneficial traits or behaviors
may be selected while deleterious alleles may not Acquired traits for the most part are not heritable For
example if an athlete works out in the gym every day building up muscle strength the athletes offspring will not
necessarily grow up to be a body builder If there is a genetic basis for the ability to run fast on the other hand
a parent may pass this to a child
