The United States of America
Nineteenthcentury views of America reflected profound changes on both 
sides of the Atlantic The United States an embodiment of political ideas from 
the European Enlightenment ascended to economic power while also evolving 
into a new model of polity for mass society It attracted immigrants from the 
Old World as well as the attention of European observers who yearned to 
understand it It was only in the twentieth century that the mania for all things

by the Czech writer Frantiek Herites 18511929 as a mixture of human 
brutality human ingenuity and human greed
