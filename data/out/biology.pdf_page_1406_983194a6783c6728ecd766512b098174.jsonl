environment Scientists who study climate have noted a series of marked changes that have gradually become
increasingly evident during the last sixty years Global climate change is the term used to describe altered
global weather patterns especially a worldwide increase in temperature and resulting changes in the climate
due largely to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide
Climate and Weather
A common misconception about global climate change is that a specific weather event occurring in a particular
region for example a very cool week in June in central Indiana provides evidence of global climate change
However a cold week in June is a weatherrelated event and not a climaterelated one These misconceptions
often arise because of confusion over the terms climate and weather
Climate refers to the longterm predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area The climate of a biome
is characterized by having consistent seasonal temperature and rainfall ranges Climate does not address the
amount of rain that fell on one particular day in a biome or the colderthanaverage temperatures that occurred
on one day In contrast weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time
Weather forecasts are usually made for 48hour cycles Longrange weather forecasts are available but can be
unreliable
To better understand the difference between climate and weather imagine that you are planning an outdoor
event in northern Wisconsin You would be thinking about climate when you plan the event in the summer rather
than the winter because you have longterm knowledge that any given Saturday in the months of May to August
would be a better choice for an outdoor event in Wisconsin than any given Saturday in January However you
cannot determine the specific day that the event should be held on because it is difficult to accurately predict the
weather on a specific day Climate can be considered average weather that takes place over many years
Global Climate Change
Climate change can be understood by approaching three areas of study

evidence of current and past global climate change

drivers of global climate change

documented results of climate change
It is helpful to keep these three different aspects of climate change clearly separated when consuming media
reports about global climate change We should note that it is common for reports and discussions about global
climate change to confuse the data showing that Earths climate is changing with the factors that drive this
climate change
Evidence for Global Climate Change
Since scientists cannot go back in time to directly measure climatic variables such as average temperature and
precipitation they must instead indirectly measure temperature To do this scientists rely on historical evidence
of Earths past climate
Antarctic ice cores are a key example of such evidence for climate change These ice cores are samples of polar
ice obtained by means of drills that reach thousands of meters into ice sheets or high mountain glaciers Viewing
the ice cores is like traveling backwards through time the deeper the sample the earlier the time period Trapped
within the ice are air bubbles and other biological evidence that can reveal temperature and carbon dioxide data
Antarctic ice cores have been collected and analyzed to indirectly estimate the temperature of the Earth over the
past 400000 years Figure 4426a The 0 C on this graph refers to the longterm average Temperatures that
are greater than 0 C exceed Earths longterm average temperature Conversely temperatures that are less
than 0 C are less than Earths average temperature This figure shows that there have been periodic cycles of
increasing and decreasing temperature
