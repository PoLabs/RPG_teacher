European Integration and the Single Market
In addition to the external impetus of the Marshall Plan the integration 
of the Western European economies was also fostered from within Next 
to countless international organisations focussing on international and 
European commerce and labour relations such as the Organisation for 
European Economic Cooperation OEEC today OECD or the International 
Labour Organization ILO the European Coal and Steel Community ECSC 
was founded in 1951 With the Treaty of Paris the signees Belgium France 
Italy Luxembourg the Netherlands and West Germany decided to jointly 
regulate their coal and steel industries The ECSC was headed by a joint 
tripartite high authority and is often seen as one of the first cornerstones 
of even deeper European market integration This deeper European market 
integration continued more officially with the establishment of the European 
Economic Community EEC and the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957 
which declared the ambition to lay the foundations of an ever closer union 
among the peoples of Europe to ensure the economic and social progress 
of their countries by common action to eliminate the barriers which divide 
Europe and to remove existing obstacles to eventually guarantee steady 
expansion balanced trade and fair competition among other goals 
While the member states had originally planned to form three joint 
communitiesthe EEC the European Atomic Community and a Joint 
European Defense communitythe latter could not be realised as no 
agreement could be found on how to proceed Hence much focus was placed 
on creating a jointly regulated European market without tolls and with easier 
importexport regulations between the partners 
As economic historians such as Barry Eichengreen Kiran Patel and others 
have shown there is considerable debate on how much the EEC contributed to 
the European Trente Glorieusesmeaning the thirtyyear period of prosperity 
and rapid economic growth in most economies in Western Europe and beyond 
following the Second World Warespecially given the countless other global 
economic networks the six member states were also involved in during this 
era There is wide agreement however that despite countless crises such as 
the end of the boom in the 1970s the two oil crises and various economic 
slumps including the latest financial crises after the turn of the millennium the 
process of creating a single European market aimed at eventually facilitating 
the four freedomsmeaning free movement of goods service people and 
capitalhas significantly deepened European economic cooperation and 
standardisation 
The single European market currently comprises twentyseven member 
states which hold privileged trade relations with many external partner
