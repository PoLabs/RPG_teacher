Figure 3226 Grafting is an artificial method of asexual reproduction used to produce plants combining favorable stem
characteristics with favorable root characteristics The stem of the plant to be grafted is known as the scion and the
root is called the stock
Cutting
Plants such as coleus and money plant are propagated through stem cuttings where a portion of the stem
containing nodes and internodes is placed in moist soil and allowed to root In some species stems can start
producing a root even when placed only in water For example leaves of the African violet will root if kept in
water undisturbed for several weeks
Layering
Layering is a method in which a stem attached to the plant is bent and covered with soil Young stems that can
be bent easily without any injury are preferred Jasmine and bougainvillea paper flower can be propagated this
way Figure 3227 In some plants a modified form of layering known as air layering is employed A portion
of the bark or outermost covering of the stem is removed and covered with moss which is then taped Some
gardeners also apply rooting hormone After some time roots will appear and this portion of the plant can be
removed and transplanted into a separate pot
