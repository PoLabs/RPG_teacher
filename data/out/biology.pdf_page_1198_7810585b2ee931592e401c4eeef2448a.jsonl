The clavicles are Sshaped bones that position the arms on the body The clavicles lie horizontally across the
front of the thorax chest just above the first rib These bones are fairly fragile and are susceptible to fractures
For example a fall with the arms outstretched causes the force to be transmitted to the clavicles which can
break if the force is excessive The clavicle articulates with the sternum and the scapula
The scapulae are flat triangular bones that are located at the back of the pectoral girdle They support the
muscles crossing the shoulder joint A ridge called the spine runs across the back of the scapula and can easily
be felt through the skin Figure 3811 The spine of the scapula is a good example of a bony protrusion that
facilitates a broad area of attachment for muscles to bone
The Upper Limb
The upper limb contains 30 bones in three regions the arm shoulder to elbow the forearm ulna and radius
and the wrist and hand Figure 3812
Figure 3812 The upper limb consists of the humerus of the upper arm the radius and ulna of the forearm eight bones
of the carpus five bones of the metacarpus and 14 bones of the phalanges
An articulation is any place at which two bones are joined The humerus is the largest and longest bone of the
upper limb and the only bone of the arm It articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at
the elbow The forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones the ulna and the radius
The radius is located along the lateral thumb side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow
The ulna is located on the medial aspect pinkyfinger side of the forearm It is longer than the radius The ulna
articulates with the humerus at the elbow The radius and ulna also articulate with the carpal bones and with
each other which in vertebrates enables a variable degree of rotation of the carpus with respect to the long axis
of the limb The hand includes the eight bones of the carpus wrist the five bones of the metacarpus palm
and the 14 bones of the phalanges digits Each digit consists of three phalanges except for the thumb when
present which has only two
The Pelvic Girdle
The pelvic girdle attaches to the lower limbs of the axial skeleton Because it is responsible for bearing the
weight of the body and for locomotion the pelvic girdle is securely attached to the axial skeleton by strong
ligaments It also has deep sockets with robust ligaments to securely attach the femur to the body The pelvic
girdle is further strengthened by two large hip bones In adults the hip bones or coxal bones are formed by
the fusion of three pairs of bones the ilium ischium and pubis The pelvis joins together in the anterior of the
body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the sacrum at the posterior of the body
The female pelvis is slightly different from the male pelvis Over generations of evolution females with a wider
pubic angle and larger diameter pelvic canal reproduced more successfully Therefore their offspring also had
pelvic anatomy that enabled successful childbirth Figure 3813
