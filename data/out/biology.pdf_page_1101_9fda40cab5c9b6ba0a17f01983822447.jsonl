brain and from the brain to the body The spinal cord is contained within the bones of the vertebrate column
but is able to communicate signals to and from the body through its connections with spinal nerves part of the
peripheral nervous system A crosssection of the spinal cord looks like a white oval containing a gray butterfly
shape as illustrated in Figure 3525 Myelinated axons make up the white matter and neuron and glial cell
bodies make up the gray matter Gray matter is also composed of interneurons which connect two neurons
each located in different parts of the body Axons and cell bodies in the dorsal facing the back of the animal
spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain Axons and cell bodies in the ventral
facing the front of the animal spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the
body
The spinal cord also controls motor reflexes These reflexes are quick unconscious movementslike
automatically removing a hand from a hot object Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic
connections For example the knee reflex that a doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single
synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron While a reflex may only require the involvement of one
or two synapses synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit information to the brain to convey
what happened the knee jerked or the hand was hot
In the United States there around 10000 spinal cord injuries each year Because the spinal cord is the
information superhighway connecting the brain with the body damage to the spinal cord can lead to paralysis
The extent of the paralysis depends on the location of the injury along the spinal cord and whether the spinal
cord was completely severed For example if the spinal cord is damaged at the level of the neck it can cause
paralysis from the neck down whereas damage to the spinal column further down may limit paralysis to the legs
Spinal cord injuries are notoriously difficult to treat because spinal nerves do not regenerate although ongoing
research suggests that stem cell transplants may be able to act as a bridge to reconnect severed nerves
Researchers are also looking at ways to prevent the inflammation that worsens nerve damage after injury One
such treatment is to pump the body with cold saline to induce hypothermia This cooling can prevent swelling
and other processes that are thought to worsen spinal cord injuries

354  The Peripheral Nervous System
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the organization and functions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems

Describe the organization and function of the sensorysomatic nervous system
The peripheral nervous system PNS is the connection between the central nervous system and the rest of the
body The CNS is like the power plant of the nervous system It creates the signals that control the functions
of the body The PNS is like the wires that go to individual houses Without those wires the signals produced
by the CNS could not control the body and the CNS would not be able to receive sensory information from the
body either
The PNS can be broken down into the autonomic nervous system which controls bodily functions without
conscious control and the sensorysomatic nervous system which transmits sensory information from the
skin muscles and sensory organs to the CNS and sends motor commands from the CNS to the muscles
