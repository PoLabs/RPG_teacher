Explain the various body forms and bodily functions of sponges
As we have seen the vast majority of invertebrate animals do not possess a defined bony vertebral
endoskeleton or a bony cranium However one of the most ancestral groups of deuterostome invertebrates the
Echinodermata do produce tiny skeletal bones called ossicles that make up a true endoskeleton or internal
skeleton covered by an epidermis
We will start our investigation with the simplest of all the invertebratesanimals sometimes classified within
the clade Parazoa beside the animals This clade currently includes only the phylum Placozoa containing a
single species Trichoplax adhaerens and the phylum Porifera containing the more familiar sponges Figure
282 The split between the Parazoa and the Eumetazoa all animal clades above Parazoa likely took place
over a billion years ago
We should reiterate here that the Porifera do not possess true tissues that are embryologically homologous
to those of all other derived animal groups such as the insects and mammals This is because they do not
create a true gastrula during embryogenesis and as a result do not produce a true endoderm or ectoderm
But even though they are not considered to have true tissues they do have specialized cells that perform
specific functions like tissues for example the external pinacoderm of a sponge acts like our epidermis Thus
functionally the poriferans can be said to have tissues however these tissues are likely not embryologically
homologous to our own
Sponge larvae eg parenchymula and amphiblastula are flagellated and able to swim however adults are
nonmotile and spend their life attached to a substratum Since water is vital to sponges for feeding excretion
and gas exchange their body structure facilitates the movement of water through the sponge Various canals
chambers and cavities enable water to move through the sponge to allow the exchange of food and waste as
well as the exchange of gases to nearly all body cells

Morphology of Sponges
There are at least 5000 named species of sponges likely with thousands more yet to be classified The
morphology of the simplest sponges takes the shape of an irregular cylinder with a large central cavity the
spongocoel occupying the inside of the cylinder Figure 283 Water enters into the spongocoel through
numerous pores or ostia that create openings in the body wall Water entering the spongocoel is expelled via a
