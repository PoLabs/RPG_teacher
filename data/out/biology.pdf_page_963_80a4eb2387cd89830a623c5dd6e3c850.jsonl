Macronutrients and Micronutrients
The essential elements can be divided into two groups macronutrients and micronutrients Nutrients that plants
require in larger amounts are called macronutrients About half of the essential elements are considered
macronutrients carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium and sulfur
The first of these macronutrients carbon C is required to form carbohydrates proteins nucleic acids and
many other compounds it is therefore present in all macromolecules On average the dry weight excluding
water of a cell is 50 percent carbon As shown in Figure 313 carbon is a key part of plant biomolecules
Figure 313 Cellulose the main structural component of the plant cell wall makes up over thirty percent of plant matter
It is the most abundant organic compound on earth
The next most abundant element in plant cells is nitrogen N it is part of proteins and nucleic acids Nitrogen
is also used in the synthesis of some vitamins Hydrogen and oxygen are macronutrients that are part of many
organic compounds and also form water Oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration plants use oxygen to
store energy in the form of ATP Phosphorus P another macromolecule is necessary to synthesize nucleic
acids and phospholipids As part of ATP phosphorus enables food energy to be converted into chemical
energy through oxidative phosphorylation Likewise light energy is converted into chemical energy during
photophosphorylation in photosynthesis and into chemical energy to be extracted during respiration Sulfur is
part of certain amino acids such as cysteine and methionine and is present in several coenzymes Sulfur also
plays a role in photosynthesis as part of the electron transport chain where hydrogen gradients play a key role
in the conversion of light energy into ATP Potassium K is important because of its role in regulating stomatal
