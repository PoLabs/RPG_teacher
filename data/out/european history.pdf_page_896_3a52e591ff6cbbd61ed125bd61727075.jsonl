evaluating the mediums unique ability to represent slaves as human beings 
to a mass public and to document the horrific conditions of their enslavement 
in the American South and elsewhere 
Other authors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who 
began to discuss the overall effect of modern mass media on society included 
American sociologist Charles Horton Cooley 18641929 Cooleys The 
Process of Social Change 1897 for example underlined the chances he saw in 
the modern newspaper and other new means of communication to enhance 
public knowledge and to counter misinformation which as he believed lay 
at the heart of conflicts and wars Here a topic entered public debate which 
would continue to be discussed throughout the twentieth century namely the 
optimistic narrative of media change which tends to focus on the enlightening 
and democratising effects of new media an interpretation that was echoed 
when the Internet began its growth as a medium These theories became 
almost immediately countered by more pessimistic interpretations a framing 
which led to two strands of media discourse that have been with us since the 
nineteenth century
The establishment of a new field of knowledge dedicated to the study of 
media was inspired by various social political and cultural reorientations 
within a more complex media landscape in the first half of the twentieth 
century In the context of the First World War and its aftermathwhen state
driven propaganda and new ideas about the possibilities to inform or mis
lead mass audiences opened up new ways of thinking about media and their 
effects on societythe impact that single media or media ensembles have 
on individuals as well as on societies came under scrutiny Some of the most 
prominent texts that still inform our interpretations today were written in 
the interwar period when systematic approaches to media communication 
became a common feature in different arenas of public life Sociologists critics 
writing for newspapers socalled newspaper scholars and psychologists
all professional observers of societystarted to engage in a field of knowledge 
that might be called media studies avant la lettre Two strands stood out One of 
them was the approach that investigated the possibilities and the constraints of 
mass communication using empirical methods Different actors from scholarly 
as well as political and commercial backgrounds engaged in these activities 
The other strand of voices took a more critical sociological approach Theorists 
like Siegfried Kracauer 18891966 or Walter Benjamin 18921940 influenced 
and helped formulate the contemporary view of media as creating a new 
mode of communication which in turn sometimes also worked in favour of 
undemocratic or fascist political powers and they also informed an influential 
way of thinking about media that through the socalled Frankfurt School 
still resonates as an interpretation of mass media communication today
