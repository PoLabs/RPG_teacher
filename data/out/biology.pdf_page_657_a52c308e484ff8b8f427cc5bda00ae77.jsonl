Foraminiferans
Foraminiferans or forams are unicellular heterotrophic protists ranging from approximately 20 micrometers to
several centimeters in length and occasionally resembling tiny snails Figure 2318 As a group the forams
exhibit porous shells called tests that are built from various organic materials and typically hardened with
calcium carbonate The tests may house photosynthetic algae which the forams can harvest for nutrition
Foram pseudopodia extend through the pores and allow the forams to move feed and gather additional
building materials Typically forams are associated with sand or other particles in marine or freshwater habitats
Foraminiferans are also useful as indicators of pollution and changes in global weather patterns

Radiolarians
A second subtype of Rhizaria the radiolarians exhibit intricate exteriors of glassy silica with radial or bilateral
symmetry Figure 2319 Needlelike pseudopods supported by microtubules radiate outward from the cell
bodies of these protists and function to catch food particles The shells of dead radiolarians sink to the ocean
floor where they may accumulate in 100 meterthick depths Preserved sedimented radiolarians are very
common in the fossil record
