All the same he suddenly refused to go a step further and flung himself on the
ground Go on if you must he said Im just going to lie here and sleep and
dream of food if I cant get it any other way I hope I never wake up again
At that very moment Balin who was a little way ahead called out What
was that I thought I saw a twinkle of light in the forest
They all looked and a longish way off it seemed they saw a red twinkle in
the dark then another and another sprang out beside it Even Bombur got up
and they hurried along then not caring if it was trolls or goblins The light was
