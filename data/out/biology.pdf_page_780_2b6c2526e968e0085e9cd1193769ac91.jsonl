Animal Characterization Based on Body Symmetry
At a very basic level of classification true animals can be largely divided into three groups based on the type of
symmetry of their body plan radially symmetrical bilaterally symmetrical and asymmetrical Asymmetry is seen
in two modern clades the Parazoa Figure 277a and Placozoa Although we should note that the ancestral
fossils of the Parazoa apparently exhibited bilateral symmetry One clade the Cnidaria Figure 277bc
exhibits radial or biradial symmetry Ctenophores have rotational symmetry Figure 277e Bilateral symmetry
is seen in the largest of the clades the Bilateria Figure 277d however the Echinodermata are bilateral as
larvae and metamorphose secondarily into radial adults All types of symmetry are well suited to meet the unique
demands of a particular animals lifestyle
Radial symmetry is the arrangement of body parts around a central axis as is seen in a bicycle wheel or pie
It results in animals having top and bottom surfaces but no left and right sides nor front or back If a radially
symmetrical animal is divided in any direction along the oralaboral axis the side with a mouth is oral side and
the side without a mouth is the aboral side the two halves will be mirror images This form of symmetry marks
the body plans of many animals in the phyla Cnidaria including jellyfish and adult sea anemones Figure 277b
c Radial symmetry equips these sea creatures which may be sedentary or only capable of slow movement or
floating to experience the environment equally from all directions Bilaterally symmetrical animals like butterflies
Figure 277d have only a single plane along which the body can be divided into equivalent halves The
Ctenophora Figure 277e although they look similar to jellyfish are considered to have rotational symmetry
rather than radial or biradial symmetry because division of the body into two halves along the oralaboral axis
divides them into two copies of the same half with one copy rotated 180o rather than two mirror images

Bilateral symmetry involves the division of the animal through a midsagittal plane resulting in two superficially
mirror images right and left halves such as those of a butterfly Figure 277d crab or human body Animals
with bilateral symmetry have a head and tail anterior vs posterior front and back dorsal vs ventral and
right and left sides Figure 278 All Eumetazoa except those with secondary radial symmetry are bilaterally
symmetrical The evolution of bilateral symmetry that allowed for the formation of anterior and posterior head
and tail ends promoted a phenomenon called cephalization which refers to the collection of an organized
nervous system at the animals anterior end In contrast to radial symmetry which is best suited for stationary or
limitedmotion lifestyles bilateral symmetry allows for streamlined and directional motion In evolutionary terms
this simple form of symmetry promoted active and controlled directional mobility and increased sophistication of
