The problem
With so much data to leverage Netflix had wideranging goals for the companys marketing 
analytics However all of the organisations goals contributed to the companys larger 
business objectives to focus on customer retention
Netflix aimed to go beyond basic user demographics to understand what customers 
want from a streaming platform and what was likely to convince them to stay With this 
knowledge Netflix believed it could create better products and services for happier 
customers
The company acknowledged that access issues service outages and platform flaws could 
all lead to unhappy customers and negative sentiment which could cause customers to 
seek out an alternative solution
By identifying problems early through marketing analytics Netflix worked towards 
improving and continued to innovate 
The solution 
To work towards its customer retention objective Netflix collected data from virtually 
every interaction with its 150 million subscribers The company then used marketing 
analytics tools to process this native data and evaluate everything from how customers 
navigate the platform to what they watch
By creating such detailed customer profiles Netflix was able to make much more per
sonalised recommendations for each user The more data the company collected the 
more it could tailor its algorithm to suggest the ideal content to each individual viewer
To better understand the platforms users Netflix collected such data as
	
The devices viewers used to stream content
	
Day of week and time of day when users viewed content
	
Number of serial episodes viewers watched in a row
	
Whether viewers paused and resumed content
	
Number and type of searches users performed
Netflix also welcomed user feedback on content The company incorporated these content 
ratings into their analysis to better understand viewer preferences
The results
According to the streaming platform the Netflix algorithm was responsible for about 80 
of viewer activity The company successfully collected relevant data and used marketing 
analytics to generate recommendations that encourage viewers to continue watching 
and subscribing
