Figure 2615 Angiosperm life cycle The life cycle of an angiosperm is shown Anthers and carpels are structures
that shelter the actual gametophytes the pollen grain and embryo sac Double fertilization is a process unique to
angiosperms credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal
Question If a flower lacked a megasporangium what type of gamete would not form If the flower lacked a
microsporangium what type of gamete would not form
The ovule sheltered within the ovary of the carpel contains the megasporangium protected by two layers of
integuments and the ovary wall Within each megasporangium a diploid megasporocyte undergoes meiosis
generating four haploid megasporesthree small and one large Only the large megaspore survives it divides
mitotically three times to produce eight nuclei distributed among the seven cells of the female gametophyte or
embryo sac Three of these cells are located at each pole of the embryo sac The three cells at one pole become
the egg and two synergids The three cells at the opposite pole become antipodal cells The center cell contains
the remaining two nuclei polar nuclei This cell will eventually produce the endosperm of the seed The mature
embryo sac then contains one egg cell two synergids or helper cells three antipodal cells which eventually
degenerate and a central cell with two polar nuclei When a pollen grain reaches the stigma a pollen tube
extends from the grain grows down the style and enters through the micropyle an opening in the integuments
of the ovule The two sperm are deposited in the embryo sac
A double fertilization event then occurs One sperm and the egg combine forming a diploid zygotethe
future embryo The other sperm fuses with the polar nuclei forming a triploid cell that will develop into the
endospermthe tissue that serves as a food reserve for the developing embryo The zygote develops into an
