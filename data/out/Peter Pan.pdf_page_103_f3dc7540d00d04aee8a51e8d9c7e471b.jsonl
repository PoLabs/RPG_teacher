I cant come she said apologetically I have forgotten how to
fly
Ill soon teach you again
O Peter dont waste the fairy dust on me
She had risen and now at last a fear assailed him What is it he
cried shrinking
I will turn up the light she said and then you can see for
yourself
For almost the only time in his life that I know of Peter was
afraid Dont turn up the light he cried
She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy She was not a
little girl heartbroken about him she was a grown woman smiling at
it all but they were weteyed smiles
Then she turned up the light and Peter saw He gave a cry of pain
and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he
drew back sharply
What is it he cried again
She had to tell him
I am old Peter I am ever so much more than twenty I grew up
long ago
You promised not to
I couldnt help it I am a married woman Peter
No youre not
Yes and the little girl in the bed is my baby
No shes not
But he supposed she was and he took a step towards the sleeping
child with his dagger upraised Of course he did not strike He sat
down on the floor instead and sobbed and Wendy did not know how
to comfort him though she could have done it so easily once She
was only a woman now and she ran out of the room to try to think
Peter continued to cry and soon his sobs woke Jane She sat up in
bed and was interested at once
Boy she said why are you crying
Peter rose and bowed to her and she bowed to him from the bed
Hullo he said
Hullo said Jane
My name is Peter Pan he told her
Yes I know
I came back for my mother he explained to take her to the
Neverland
Yes I know Jane said I have been waiting for you
When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the
bedpost crowing gloriously while Jane in her nighty was flying
round the room in solemn ecstasy
She is my mother Peter explained and Jane descended and
stood by his side with the look in her face that he liked to see on
ladies when they gazed at him
He does so need a mother Jane said
