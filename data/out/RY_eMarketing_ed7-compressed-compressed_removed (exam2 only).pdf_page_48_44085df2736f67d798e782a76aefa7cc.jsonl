Content creation Video
it is exactly what your target audience wants theres nothing very engaging about listening to 
people being asked questions over multiple episodes unless every episode stimulates thought 
interest or entertainment 
To improve how it will be consumed consider using one or two interviews interspersed with 
some scripting and interesting narrative Have you really chosen the most original angle you 
could have or is it a bit of a seenbefore
If you are going to use an interview think about how you could present it A lot of times the 
part where you ask the question is cut out and the answers given by the interviewee are edited 
together into one piece This helps to make the format a little more compelling
Remember to tell a story 
Share a story or a series of stories but avoid a dry statement of facts Make sure that youve 
done your research for your audience For instance few people need to know how to eat a 
strict keto diet again There are a million other video series just like it Maybe they want to 
know how to eat a strict keto diet with practically no money  your research will give you the 
cues you need to direct the story 
Be brutally honest with yourself
When it comes to creating digital content being honest with yourself is very important After 
youve watchedlistened to what youve created and you ask yourself Would somebody really 
download this answer honestly There is no point in creating average content when its your 
product Were in the business of making content that sells If its just okay go back and see 
how you could make it good If its good go back and see how you could make it great Dont 
be content with the ordinary 
Spend a lot of time watching and listening 
Watching how other people create successful content is an excellent way to pick up tips and 
follow best practice Look at what they do well what they dont do so well and what they could 
do better Then bring your own production up to speed
