With the Dada movement in the late 1910s and early 1920s the protest against 
conventional values had already been pushed to an extreme to the point of 
denying all traditional values as well as art itself Reducing art to pure action

demystify all values Although there was no term to describe these attempts as

of the avantgarde through its desire to dissolve and reformulate artistic 
categories
