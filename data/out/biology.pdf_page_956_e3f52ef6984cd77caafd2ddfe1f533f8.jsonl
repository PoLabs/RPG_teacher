CHAPTER SUMMARY
301 The Plant Body
A vascular plant consists of two organ systems the shoot system and the root system The shoot system
includes the aboveground vegetative portions stems and leaves and reproductive parts flowers and fruits
The root system supports the plant and is usually underground A plant is composed of two main types of
tissue meristematic tissue and permanent tissue Meristematic tissue consists of actively dividing cells found in
root and shoot tips As growth occurs meristematic tissue differentiates into permanent tissue which is
categorized as either simple or complex Simple tissues are made up of similar cell types examples include
dermal tissue and ground tissue Dermal tissue provides the outer covering of the plant Ground tissue is
responsible for photosynthesis it also supports vascular tissue and may store water and sugars Complex
tissues are made up of different cell types Vascular tissue for example is made up of xylem and phloem cells
302 Stems
The stem of a plant bears the leaves flowers and fruits Stems are characterized by the presence of nodes
the points of attachment for leaves or branches and internodes regions between nodes
Plant organs are made up of simple and complex tissues The stem has three tissue systems dermal vascular
and ground tissue Dermal tissue is the outer covering of the plant It contains epidermal cells stomata guard
cells and trichomes Vascular tissue is made up of xylem and phloem tissues and conducts water minerals
and photosynthetic products Ground tissue is responsible for photosynthesis and support and is composed of
parenchyma collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells
Primary growth occurs at the tips of roots and shoots causing an increase in length Woody plants may also
exhibit secondary growth or increase in thickness In woody plants especially trees annual rings may form as
growth slows at the end of each season Some plant species have modified stems that help to store food
propagate new plants or discourage predators Rhizomes corms stolons runners tubers bulbs tendrils and
thorns are examples of modified stems
303 Roots
Roots help to anchor a plant absorb water and minerals and serve as storage sites for food Taproots and
fibrous roots are the two main types of root systems In a taproot system a main root grows vertically
downward with a few lateral roots Fibrous root systems arise at the base of the stem where a cluster of roots
forms a dense network that is shallower than a taproot The growing root tip is protected by a root cap The root
tip has three main zones a zone of cell division cells are actively dividing a zone of elongation cells increase
in length and a zone of maturation cells differentiate to form different kinds of cells Root vascular tissue
conducts water minerals and sugars In some habitats the roots of certain plants may be modified to form
aerial roots or epiphytic roots
