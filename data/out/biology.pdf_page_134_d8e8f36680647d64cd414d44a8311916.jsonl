Cardiologist
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States This is primarily due to our sedentary
lifestyle and our high transfat diets
Heart failure is just one of many disabling heart conditions Heart failure does not mean that the heart has
stopped working Rather it means that the heart cant pump with sufficient force to transport oxygenated
blood to all the vital organs Left untreated heart failure can lead to kidney failure and other organ failure
Cardiac muscle tissue comprises the hearts wall Heart failure occurs when cardiac muscle cells
endoplasmic reticula do not function properly As a result an insufficient number of calcium ions are
available to trigger a sufficient contractile force
Cardiologists cardi  heart ologist  one who studies are doctors who specialize in treating heart
diseases including heart failure Cardiologists can diagnose heart failure via a physical examination results
from an electrocardiogram ECG a test that measures the hearts electrical activity a chest Xray to see
whether the heart is enlarged and other tests If the cardiologist diagnoses heart failure he or she will
typically prescribe appropriate medications and recommend a reduced table salt intake and a supervised
exercise program
The Golgi Apparatus
We have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER and transport their contents elsewhere but where
do the vesicles go Before reaching their final destination the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles
still need sorting packaging and tagging so that they end up in the right place Sorting tagging packaging
and distributing lipids and proteins takes place in the Golgi apparatus also called the Golgi body a series of
flattened membranes Figure 420
Figure 420 The Golgi apparatus in this white blood cell is visible as a stack of semicircular flattened rings in the lower
portion of the image You can see several vesicles near the Golgi apparatus credit modification of work by Louisa
Howard
We call the Golgi apparatus the cis face The opposite side is the trans face The transport vesicles that formed
from the ER travel to the cis face fuse with it and empty their contents into the Golgi apparatus lumen As the
proteins and lipids travel through the Golgi they undergo further modifications that allow them to be sorted The
most frequent modification is adding short sugar molecule chains These newly modified proteins and lipids then
tag with phosphate groups or other small molecules in order to travel to their proper destinations
Finally the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into secretory vesicles that bud from the Golgis trans
face While some of these vesicles deposit their contents into other cell parts where they will be used other
secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell
In another example of form following function cells that engage in a great deal of secretory activity such as
salivary gland cells that secrete digestive enzymes or immune system cells that secrete antibodies have an
abundance of Golgi
In plant cells the Golgi apparatus has the additional role of synthesizing polysaccharides some of which are
