Analyze your datareport your results To find the length of time whitefish blastula cells spend in each
stage multiply the percent recorded as a decimal by 24 hours Make a table similar to Table 102 to
illustrate your data

Draw a conclusion Did your results support your estimated times Were any of the outcomes unexpected
If so discuss those events in that stage that may have contributed to the calculated time
103  Control of the Cell Cycle
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Understand how the cell cycle is controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and external to the cell

Explain how the three internal control checkpoints occur at the end of G1 at the G2M transition and
during metaphase

Describe the molecules that control the cell cycle through positive and negative regulation
The length of the cell cycle is highly variable even within the cells of a single organism In humans the frequency
of cell turnover ranges from a few hours in early embryonic development to an average of two to five days for
epithelial cells and to an entire human lifetime spent in G0 by specialized cells such as cortical neurons or
cardiac muscle cells
