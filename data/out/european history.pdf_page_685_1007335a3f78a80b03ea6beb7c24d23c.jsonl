54 LABOUR AND FORCED LABOUR

the possibilities and limitations of preindustrial production influenced the 
varying manifestations of the demesne economy From the eighteenth century 
onwards however expansion of the state power gradually encroached on 
the sway held by the landlords over the resident population a process which 
coincided with the liberalisation of labour relations
Unfree Labour Slavery Indentured Servitude Convicts 
and Conscription
Apart from these two analytical groups there existed a third category in early 
modern Europe which consisted of individuals or groups that could neither 
decide on the type of work they carried out nor enjoy freedom of movement

The institution of slavery is about as old as civilisation itself and it denotes

forms of partially free labour These developments were more fully complete 
in Western Europe with England abolishing the slave trade in 1102 however 
in Russia slavery remained legal until 1723
Slavery as an institution continued to exist in Europe and its colonies 
although it remained limited to nonChristians or tied to personal indebtedness
