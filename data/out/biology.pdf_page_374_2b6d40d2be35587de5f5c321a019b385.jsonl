Figure 133 This figure shows unlinked and linked gene inheritance patterns In a two genes are located on
different chromosomes so independent assortment occurs during meiosis The offspring have an equal chance
of being the parental type inheriting the same combination of traits as the parents or a nonparental type
inheriting a different combination of traits than the parents In b two genes are very close together on the
same chromosome so that no crossing over occurs between them Therefore the genes are always inherited
together and all the offspring are the parental type In c two genes are far apart on the chromosome such that
crossing over occurs during every meiotic event The recombination frequency will be the same as if the genes
were on separate chromosomes d The actual recombination frequency of fruit fly wing length and body color
that Thomas Morgan observed in 1912 was 17 percent A crossover frequency between 0 percent and 50 percent
indicates that the genes are on the same chromosome and crossover sometimes occurs
In a test cross for two characteristics such as the one here can the recombinant offsprings predicted
frequency be 60 percent Why or why not

Janssen did not have the technology to demonstrate crossing over so it remained an abstract idea that
scientists did not widely believe Scientists thought chiasmata were a variation on synapsis and could not
understand how chromosomes could break and rejoin Yet the data were clear that linkage did not always occur
Ultimately it took a young undergraduate student and an allnighter to mathematically elucidate the linkage
and recombination problem
In 1913 Alfred Sturtevant a student in Morgans laboratory gathered results from researchers in the laboratory
and took them home one night to mull them over By the next morning he had created the first chromosome
