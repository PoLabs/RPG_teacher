Although parts of the renal tubules are named proximal and distal in a crosssection of the kidney the tubules
are placed close together and in contact with each other and the glomerulus This allows for exchange of
chemical messengers between the different cell types For example the DCT ascending limb of the loop of
Henle has masses of cells called macula densa which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called
juxtaglomerular cells Together the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex
JGC The JGC is an endocrine structure that secretes the enzyme renin and the hormone erythropoietin When
hormones trigger the macula densa cells in the DCT due to variations in blood volume blood pressure or
electrolyte balance these cells can immediately communicate the problem to the capillaries in the afferent and
efferent arterioles which can constrict or relax to change the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys
Nephrologist
A nephrologist studies and deals with diseases of the kidneysboth those that cause kidney failure such as
diabetes and the conditions that are produced by kidney disease such as hypertension Blood pressure
blood volume and changes in electrolyte balance come under the purview of a nephrologist
Nephrologists usually work with other physicians who refer patients to them or consult with them about
specific diagnoses and treatment plans Patients are usually referred to a nephrologist for symptoms such
as blood or protein in the urine very high blood pressure kidney stones or renal failure
Nephrology is a subspecialty of internal medicine To become a nephrologist medical school is followed
by additional training to become certified in internal medicine An additional two or more years is spent
specifically studying kidney disorders and their accompanying effects on the body
413  Excretion Systems
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how vacuoles present in microorganisms work to excrete waste

Describe the way in which flame cells and nephridia in worms perform excretory functions and maintain
osmotic balance

Explain how insects use Malpighian tubules to excrete wastes and maintain osmotic balance
Microorganisms and invertebrate animals use more primitive and simple mechanisms to get rid of their metabolic
wastes than the mammalian system of kidney and urinary function Three excretory systems evolved in
organisms before complex kidneys vacuoles flame cells and Malpighian tubules
Contractile Vacuoles in Microorganisms
The most fundamental feature of life is the presence of a cell In other words a cell is the simplest functional
unit of a life Bacteria are unicellular prokaryotic organisms that have some of the least complex life processes
in place however prokaryotes such as bacteria do not contain membranebound vacuoles The cells of
microorganisms like bacteria protozoa and fungi are bound by cell membranes and use them to interact with
the environment Some cells including some leucocytes in humans are able to engulf food by endocytosisthe
formation of vesicles by involution of the cell membrane within the cells The same vesicles are able to interact
and exchange metabolites with the intracellular environment In some unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as
the amoeba shown in Figure 419 cellular wastes and excess water are excreted by exocytosis when the
contractile vacuoles merge with the cell membrane and expel wastes into the environment Contractile vacuoles
CV should not be confused with vacuoles which store food or water
