42 SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND WELFARE

education laws were passed in some German territories This concern for 
Christian education was taken up by orphanages such as those in Frankfurt 
am Main and Glaucha near Halle an der Saale which sought to integrate work 
and education in poor relief The Halle orphanage is a prime example of how 
welfare and schooling intersected The orphanage was established towards the 
end of the seventeenth century by the Lutheran pietist and divinity professor 
August Hermann Francke 16631772 Francke started a charity school aimed 
at enabling the local poor to learn a trade and earn a living and later built 
his orphanage with the support of the Prussian King This institution grew 
over time and eventually also offered education for the children of the local 
nobility and more wealthy citizens Francke prioritised religious instruction 
but languages natural sciences and practical skills were taught as well The 
orphanage was intended to be economically viable it ran a publishing business 
and bookshop as well as a medical dispensary Through Franckes teaching 
at the local university Halle also became involved in missionary work 
Missionaries trained at Halle forged alliances with religious organisations 
such as the Londonbased Anglican Society for the Promotion of Christian 
Knowledge SPCK and thus extended their charitable enterprise to other 
European countries and to other parts of the world The Francke Foundations 
later became a model for similar institutions globally
