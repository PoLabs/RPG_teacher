world and increasing globalisation it was no longer possible to lock the West 
out of the statesocialist countries
Some critical western authors such as Peter Gowan have argued that after 
the collapse of state socialism Eastern Europe became a new laboratory of 
neoliberalism Followers of the Worldsystems School warned of the negative 
social and economic impacts of the adoption of neoliberalism in Eastern 
Europe new forms of unequal exchange economic dependency on the West 
declining standards of living for unemployed people an increasing income 
gap etc While western leftists hoped that this would lead to the strengthening 
of the political left in Eastern Europe in reality the radical right was more 
successful in exploiting peoples dissatisfaction with the neoliberal order 
andin some caseswith liberal democracy itself Massive migration from 
East to West also led to political tensions in western societies such as Brexit 
in the United Kingdom Antiglobalist and antiEU forces pose further

unfortunate trends we should also keep in mind the fact that the radical right 
still constitutes a minority in Europe and liberal democracies have shown 
considerable resilience

characterised by high levels of inequality and different social problems eg 
the maintenance of the large estates in Eastern and Southern Europe after the 
Second World War communist parties in Eastern Europe radically reduced 
wealth and income differences through the imposition of a Soviettype 
political and economic order While this model was unacceptable for many 
western leftists the expansion of the welfare state everywhere reduced income 
gaps and wealth inequality to such an extent that German sociologist Ulrich 
Beck argued that class had altogether lost its meaning While we should not 
exaggerate the similarities between the socialist East and the capitalist West it 
can still be argued that both socialist societies and welfare states were driven 
by the state whose interference in the capitalist economy the neoliberals 
intended either to abolish or to drastically decrease
The neoliberal world order which has become more entrenched after the 
collapse of state socialism reversed the drive for more social and material 
equality The last decades of the twentieth centuryin Eastern Europe the 
very last decade after the fall of the Berlin Wallindeed marked a decisive
