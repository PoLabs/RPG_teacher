He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier It looked very
solid
He started to walk toward it People jostled him on their way to
platforms nine and ten Harry walked more quickly He was going to smash
right into that barrier and then hed be in trouble  leaning forward
on his cart he broke into a heavy run  the barrier was coming nearer
and nearer  he wouldnt be able to stop  the cart was out of control
 he was a foot away  he closed his eyes ready for the crash 
It didnt come he kept on running he opened his eyes A scarlet
steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people A sign
overhead said Hogwarts Express eleven Oclock Harry looked behind him
and saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had been with the
words Platform Nine and ThreeQuarters on it He had done it
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd
while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs Owls
hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and
the scraping of heavy trunks
The first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging
out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats
Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat
He passed a roundfaced boy who was saying Gran Ive lost my toad
again
Oh Neville he heard the old woman sigh
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd
Give us a look Lee go on
The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him
shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment
near the end of the train He put Hedwig inside first and then started
to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door He tried to lift it
up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it
painfully on his foot
Want a hand It was one of the redhaired twins hed followed through
