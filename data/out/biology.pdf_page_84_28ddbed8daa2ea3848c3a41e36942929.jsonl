Figure 36 Five and six carbon monosaccharides exist in equilibrium between linear and ring forms When the ring
forms the side chain it closes on locks into an  or  position Fructose and ribose also form rings although they form
fivemembered rings as opposed to the sixmembered ring of glucose
Disaccharides
Disaccharides di  two form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction or a condensation
reaction or dehydration synthesis During this process one monosaccharides hydroxyl group combines with
another monosaccharides hydrogen releasing a water molecule and forming a covalent bond A covalent bond
forms between a carbohydrate molecule and another molecule in this case between two monosaccharides
Scientists call this a glycosidic bond Figure 37 Glycosidic bonds or glycosidic linkages can be an alpha
or beta type An alpha bond is formed when the OH group on the carbon1 of the first glucose is below the ring
plane and a beta bond is formed when the OH group on the carbon1 is above the ring plane
