European Models of Otherness
Two forms of preexisting knowledge were particularly important for 
Europeans trying to make sense of new environments beyond their own 
continent Firstly they often used the everyday experiences of their own 
customs ways of speaking social hierarchies foods animals and so on to 
compare themselves to others The Spanish chronicler Fernando Gonzlez de 
Oviedo 14781557 for instance compared American avocados to European 
pears Second they relied on literary sources The Bible provided what was 
regarded as the authoritative account of the creation of the world and the spread 
of human groups around the planet Holy scripture provided a surprisingly 
flexible framework for integrating the various peoples and communities 
encountered by Europeans into preexisting worldviews and assigning them 
a place in wider human history Following the conquest of Constantinople by 
the Ottomans in 1453 for instance the military success of their empire was 
increasingly interpreted in eschatological terms as divine punishment and a 
harbinger of the approaching apocalypse In no small way this interpretation 
contributed to the development of the theological positions associated with 
the Reformation and the resulting split of European Christianity 
In dealing with other parts of the world Europeans also drew on classical 
sources describing geographical areas far away from the Mediterranean 
The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle 385323 BC spoke about extreme 
climatic zones and a middle area where civilisation flourished the Roman 
author Pliny 232479 described fabulous races including dogheaded 
humans the ancient Greek historian Herodotus 484425 BC produced 
enduring depictions of external barbarians and the Greek mathematician 
Ptolemy 100170 modelled geographical concepts on the shape and size of 
the world Many other formal and informal modes of knowledge undergirded 
the frameworks within which Europeans were able to see compare and talk 
about the worlds of others Fictional prose was sometimes used too The 
Spanish soldier Bernal Diaz del Castillo 14921584 referred to the imagined 
cities described in the wellknown medieval chivalry novel Amads de Gaula 
when he tried to communicate the awe he experienced in his first encounter 
with the city of Tenochtitlan the capital of the Aztec Empire in todays Mexico 
City As shown by these examples new information was often arranged 
through comparisons and filtered through previous experiences in order to 
make sense of the world But at the same time this expanding body of factual 
knowledge alongside firsthand experiences of new worlds and new peoples 
altogether had a critical impact on established systems of European thought 
engendering new intellectual classifications and new methods of observing 
and analysing natural phenomena
