to the national state governments discussed ways to enhance the states 
impact on citizens health and hygiene as well as social affairs in and around 
the workplace most prominently in and around the factories Apart from 
creating and widening extensive hygiene regimesby investing in sanitation 
infrastructure and often socially discriminatory hygiene educationmost 
European governments also passed legislation regulating compensation 
for accidents in the workplace Social policies aiming at the protection of 
nursing mothers and children were introduced across Europe throughout 
the nineteenth century In addition invalidity unemployment and old age 
were discursively defined as looming social problems for which solutions had 
to be found
These debates were pushed forward by different players and on different 
levels The labour movement while closely embedded locally often running 
its own welfare organisations was also transnational in nature Its leaders 
such as Louis Blanc 18111882 or Ferdinand Lassalle 18251864 fought for 
the improvement of social conditions while pointing out that inequality and 
misery of the working classes were mostly the effect of the capitalist order
which ultimately needed to be overcome On the other side there were various 
socalled social reformers often highranking civil servants men and women 
of the bourgeoisie including some factory owners as well as scientists and 
intellectuals who drew attention to the social question and its potentially 
detrimental implications for the stability of the rising European nationstates 
Towards the end of the nineteenth century reformist European and even 
transatlantic debate as well as pressure from organised workers led to the 
establishment of large governmentrun welfare programs in many European 
countries
In Germany for instance the first staterun social insurance schemes 
were invented in the 1880s Health insurance 1883 and especially oldage or 
invalidity insurance 1889 were established as central programmes granting 
limited sick leave eg after accidents at work and rather minimal funds to 
invalids and the elderly older than 70 The introduction of these Bismarckian 
insurance schemes named after the German Chancellor Bismarck see Figure 
2 which depicts German welfare programmes as branches of a German oak 
tree were closely monitored by international reformers and government 
experts and adapted to local conditions in many European states afterwards 
Subsequently governmentrun insurance models to which employers 
and workers contributed as well as taxbased welfare programmesoften 
meanstested and only accessible after close scrutiny of whether applicants 
were officially needyemerged in many European countries While the 
programmes differed between nations most European governments were keen 
to define a new role for the state in social affairs Slowly but surely the idea 
that welfare and social prevention were a collective challengea challenge
