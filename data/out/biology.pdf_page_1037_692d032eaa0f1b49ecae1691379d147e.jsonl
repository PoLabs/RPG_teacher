such as the activity of bees to warm a hive to survive winter
Many animals especially mammals use metabolic waste heat as a heat source When muscles are contracted
most of the energy from the ATP used in muscle actions is wasted energy that translates into heat Severe cold
elicits a shivering reflex that generates heat for the body Many species also have a type of adipose tissue called
brown fat that specializes in generating heat
Neural Control of Thermoregulation
The nervous system is important to thermoregulation as illustrated in Figure 3322 The processes of
homeostasis and temperature control are centered in the hypothalamus of the advanced animal brain
Figure 3323 The body is able to regulate temperature in response to signals from the nervous system
When bacteria are destroyed by leuckocytes pyrogens are released into the blood Pyrogens reset
the bodys thermostat to a higher temperature resulting in fever How might pyrogens cause the body
temperature to rise
The hypothalamus maintains the set point for body temperature through reflexes that cause vasodilation
and sweating when the body is too warm or vasoconstriction and shivering when the body is too cold It
responds to chemicals from the body When a bacterium is destroyed by phagocytic leukocytes chemicals called
endogenous pyrogens are released into the blood These pyrogens circulate to the hypothalamus and reset the
thermostat This allows the bodys temperature to increase in what is commonly called a fever An increase in
body temperature causes iron to be conserved which reduces a nutrient needed by bacteria An increase in
body heat also increases the activity of the animals enzymes and protective cells while inhibiting the enzymes
and activity of the invading microorganisms Finally heat itself may also kill the pathogen A fever that was once
thought to be a complication of an infection is now understood to be a normal defense mechanism
