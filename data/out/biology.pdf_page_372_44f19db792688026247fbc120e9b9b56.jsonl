131  Chromosomal Theory and Genetic Linkage
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss Suttons Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance

Describe genetic linkage

Explain the process of homologous recombination or crossing over

Describe chromosome creation

Calculate the distances between three genes on a chromosome using a threepoint test cross
Long before scientists visualized chromosomes under a microscope the father of modern genetics Gregor
Mendel began studying heredity in 1843 With improved microscopic techniques during the late 1800s cell
biologists could stain and visualize subcellular structures with dyes and observe their actions during cell division
and meiosis With each mitotic division chromosomes replicated condensed from an amorphous no constant
shape nuclear mass into distinct Xshaped bodies pairs of identical sister chromatids and migrated to
separate cellular poles
Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
The speculation that chromosomes might be the key to understanding heredity led several scientists to examine
Mendels publications and reevaluate his model in terms of chromosome behavior during mitosis and meiosis
In 1902 Theodor Boveri observed that proper sea urchin embryonic development does not occur unless
chromosomes are present That same year Walter Sutton observed chromosome separation into daughter cells
during meiosis Figure 132 Together these observations led to the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian inheritance
Figure 132 a Walter Sutton and b Theodor Boveri developed the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance which states
that chromosomes carry the unit of heredity genes
The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was consistent with Mendels laws which the following observations
supported

During meiosis homologous chromosome pairs migrate as discrete structures that are independent of other
chromosome pairs

Chromosome sorting from each homologous pair into pregametes appears to be random

Each parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half their chromosomal complement

Even though male and female gametes sperm and egg differ in size and morphology they have the same
number of chromosomes suggesting equal genetic contributions from each parent

The gametic chromosomes combine during fertilization to produce offspring with the same chromosome
number as their parents
