4 What is the difference between micro and
macroevolution
a
Microevolution describes the evolution of
small organisms such as insects while
macroevolution describes the evolution of
large organisms like people and elephants
b
Microevolution describes the evolution of
microscopic entities such as molecules and
proteins while macroevolution describes the
evolution of whole organisms
c
Microevolution describes the evolution of
organisms in populations while
macroevolution describes the evolution of
species over long periods of time
d
Microevolution describes the evolution of
organisms over their lifetimes while
macroevolution describes the evolution of
organisms over multiple generations
5 Population genetics is the study of
a
how selective forces change the allele
frequencies in a population over time
b
the genetic basis of populationwide traits
c
whether traits have a genetic basis
d
the degree of inbreeding in a population
6 Which of the following populations is not in Hardy
Weinberg equilibrium
a

individuals yy 8 homozygous dominant
individuals YY and 4 heterozygous
individuals Yy
b
a population in which the allele frequencies
do not change over time
c
p2  2pq  q2  1
d
a population undergoing natural selection
7 One of the original Amish colonies rose from a
ship of colonists that came from Europe The ships
captain who had polydactyly a rare dominant trait
was one of the original colonists Today we see a
much higher frequency of polydactyly in the Amish
population This is an example of
a
natural selection
b
genetic drift
c
founder effect
d
b and c
8 When male lions reach sexual maturity they leave
their group in search of a new pride This can alter
the allele frequencies of the population through which
of the following mechanisms
a
natural selection
b
genetic drift
c
gene flow
d
random mating
9 Which of the following evolutionary forces can
introduce new genetic variation into a population
a
natural selection and genetic drift
b
mutation and gene flow
c
natural selection and nonrandom mating
d
mutation and genetic drift
10 What is assortative mating
a
when individuals mate with those who are
similar to themselves
b
when individuals mate with those who are
dissimilar to themselves
c
when individuals mate with those who are
the most fit in the population
d
when individuals mate with those who are
least fit in the population
11 When closely related individuals mate with each
other or inbreed the offspring are often not as fit as
the offspring of two unrelated individuals Why
a
Close relatives are genetically incompatible
b
The DNA of close relatives reacts negatively
in the offspring
c
Inbreeding can bring together rare
deleterious mutations that lead to harmful
phenotypes
d
Inbreeding causes normally silent alleles to
be expressed

the slope of a mountain where a population
lives
b
the degree to which a mutation helps an
individual survive
c
the number of individuals in the population

gradual geographic variation across an
ecological gradient

variance in a population
a
stabilizing selection
b
directional selection
c
diversifying selection
d
positive frequencydependent selection
14 When males and females of a population look or
act differently it is referred to as ________
a
sexual dimorphism
b
sexual selection
c
diversifying selection
d
