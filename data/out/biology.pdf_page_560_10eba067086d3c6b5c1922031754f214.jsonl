HGT in Prokaryotes
HGT mechanisms are quite common in the Bacteria and Archaea domains thus significantly changing the
way scientists view their evolution The majority of evolutionary models such as in the Endosymbiont Theory
propose that eukaryotes descended from multiple prokaryotes which makes HGT all the more important
to understanding the phylogenetic relationships of all extant and extinct species The Endosymbiont Theory
purports that the eukaryotes mitochondria and the green plants chloroplasts and flagellates originated as free
living prokaryotes that invaded primitive eukaryotic cells and become established as permanent symbionts in the
cytoplasm
Microbiology students are well aware that genes transfer among common bacteria These gene transfers
between species are the major mechanism whereby bacteria acquire resistance to antibiotics Classically
scientists believe that three different mechanisms drive such transfers
1
Transformation bacteria takes up naked DNA
2
Transduction a virus transfers the genes
3
Conjugation a hollow tube or pilus transfers genes between organisms
More recently scientists have discovered a fourth gene transfer mechanism between prokaryotes Small virus
like particles or gene transfer agents GTAs transfer random genomic segments from one prokaryote species
to another GTAs are responsible for genetic changes sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other
evolutionary processes Scientists characterized the first GTA in 1974 using purple nonsulfur bacteria These
GTAs which are most likely bacteriophages that lost the ability to reproduce on their own carry random DNA
pieces from one organism to another Controlled studies using marine bacteria have demonstrated GTAs ability
to act with high frequency Scientists have estimated gene transfer events in marine prokaryotes either by GTAs
or by viruses to be as high as 1013 per year in the Mediterranean Sea alone GTAs and viruses are efficient
HGT vehicles with a major impact on prokaryotic evolution
As a consequence of this modern DNA analysis the idea that eukaryotes evolved directly from Archaea has
fallen out of favor While eukaryotes share many features that are absent in bacteria such as the TATA box
located in many genes promoter region the discovery that some eukaryotic genes were more homologous with
bacterial DNA than Archaea DNA made this idea less tenable Furthermore scientists have proposed genome
fusion from Archaea and Bacteria by endosymbiosis as the ultimate event in eukaryotic evolution
HGT in Eukaryotes
Although it is easy to see how prokaryotes exchange genetic material by HGT scientists initially thought that
this process was absent in eukaryotes After all prokaryotes are but single cells exposed directly to their
environment whereas the multicellular organisms sex cells are usually sequestered in protected parts of the
body It follows from this idea that the gene transfers between multicellular eukaryotes should be more difficult
Scientists believe this process is rarer in eukaryotes and has a much smaller evolutionary impact than in
prokaryotes In spite of this HGT between distantly related organisms is evident in several eukaryotic species
and it is possible that scientists will discover more examples in the future
In plants researchers have observed gene transfer in species that cannot crosspollinate by normal means
Transposons or jumping genes have shown a transfer between rice and millet plant species Furthermore
