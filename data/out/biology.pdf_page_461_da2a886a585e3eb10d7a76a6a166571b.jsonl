Figure 1613 Gene expression can be controlled by factors that bind the translation initiation complex
An increase in phosphorylation levels of eIF2 has been observed in patients with neurodegenerative
diseases such as Alzheimers Parkinsons and Huntingtons What impact do you think this might have on
protein synthesis
Chemical Modifications Protein Activity and Longevity
Proteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including methyl phosphate acetyl and
ubiquitin groups The addition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of
time they exist in the cell Sometimes these modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cellfor
example in the nucleus in the cytoplasm or attached to the plasma membrane
Chemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress the lack of nutrients heat or
ultraviolet light exposure These changes can alter epigenetic accessibility transcription mRNA stability or
translationall resulting in changes in expression of various genes This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly
change the levels of specific proteins in response to the environment Because proteins are involved in every
stage of gene regulation the phosphorylation of a protein depending on the protein that is modified can alter
accessibility to the chromosome can alter translation by altering transcription factor binding or function can
change nuclear shuttling by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore complex can alter RNA stability by
binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability can modify translation increase or decrease or can
change posttranslational modifications add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications
The addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation Ubiquitin acts like a flag
indicating that the protein lifespan is complete These proteins are moved to the proteasome an organelle that
functions to remove proteins to be degraded Figure 1614 One way to control gene expression therefore is
to alter the longevity of the protein
