In those European countries that remained colonial powers by the end of 
the Second World War the impact of decolonisation on demographic change 
cannot be underestimated following Algerias independence from French 
colonisation more than 800000 socalled PiedsNoirs settlers of French and 
European origin relocated to mainland France and other French territories 
accompanied by numerous local collaborationists On the other hand France 
saw significant numbers of immigrants from all its former colonies who left 
their homelands for economic or political reasons In the UK citizens of the 
Commonwealtha political association of fiftyfour countries as of 2022 
most of which formerly belonged to the British Empirehad privileged 
immigration rights as British Subjects until 1962 The process of decolonisation 
had an equally important impact on smaller colonial powers such as Portugal 
or Netherlands where the influx of these newcomers increased the population 
by five to ten percent By 1970 Western Europe in particular had definitively 
transformed from an emigrant continent into an immigrant one
The word boomer or babyboomer is derived from developments after 
the Second World War when birth rates rose and the economy flourished 
The baby boom that arose in the United States or in Canada was milder in 
Europe however Pronatalist policies and the related ban on abortions or 
efforts to reduce them were soon replaced in Central and Eastern Europe by 
the complete liberalisation of abortion at the turn of the 1950s and into the 
1960s The only exception was Romania where the abortion ban introduced 
in the mid1960s led to a very shortterm increase in fertility As a result of 
the social and economic policies of the 1950s and 1960s forced collectivisation 
and rapid secularisation took place in all Soviet satellite states though at very 
different paces impacting both the livelihoods and value systems of families 
The employment rate of women increased faster than it did in the West This 
process not only brought about a tension between childbearing and work 
but the intensifying spatial mobility also resulted in a shift away from the 
immediate family which meant the loss of help from parents and relatives in 
addition to low wages and limited nursery spaces
Despite some demographic policy measures based on incentives it was the 
reduction in mortality rates that became crucial in the population growth of 
Europe until the midtwentieth century driven primarily by the decline in 
infant mortality There were important regional differences and a deterioration 
of indicators can be traced from the West to the East of Europe For example 
while the average infant mortality in interwar Sweden was fiftyfour per 
1000 newborns the number was 142 in Poland The postwar period saw a 
gradual decrease of these indicators while regional differences persisted At
