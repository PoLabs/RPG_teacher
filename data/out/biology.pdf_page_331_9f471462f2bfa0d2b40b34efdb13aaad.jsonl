Figure 1110 Plants have a life cycle that alternates between a multicellular haploid organism and a multicellular diploid
organism In some plants such as ferns both the haploid and diploid plant stages are freeliving The diploid plant
is called a sporophyte because it produces haploid spores by meiosis The spores develop into multicellular haploid
plants that are called gametophytes because they produce gametes The gametes of two individuals will fuse to form
a diploid zygote that becomes the sporophyte credit fern modification of work by Cory Zanker credit sporangia

Although all plants utilize some version of the alternation of generations the relative size of the sporophyte
and the gametophyte and the relationship between them vary greatly In plants such as moss the gametophyte
organism is the freeliving plant and the sporophyte is physically dependent on the gametophyte In other plants
such as ferns both the gametophyte and sporophyte plants are freeliving however the sporophyte is much
larger In seed plants such as magnolia trees and daisies the gametophyte is composed of only a few cells and
in the case of the female gametophyte is completely retained within the sporophyte
Sexual reproduction takes many forms in multicellular organisms The fact that nearly every multicellular
organism on Earth employs sexual reproduction is strong evidence for the benefits of producing offspring with
unique gene combinations though there are other possible benefits as well
