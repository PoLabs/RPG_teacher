Figure 303 This light micrograph shows a cross section of a squash Curcurbita maxima stem Each teardropshaped
vascular bundle consists of large xylem vessels toward the inside and smaller phloem cells toward the outside Xylem
cells which transport water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant are dead at functional maturity Phloem
cells which transport sugars and other organic compounds from photosynthetic tissue to the rest of the plant are
living The vascular bundles are encased in ground tissue and surrounded by dermal tissue credit modification of

302  Stems
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the main function and basic structure of stems

Compare and contrast the roles of dermal tissue vascular tissue and ground tissue

Distinguish between primary growth and secondary growth in stems

Summarize the origin of annual rings

List and describe examples of modified stems
Stems are a part of the shoot system of a plant They may range in length from a few millimeters to hundreds
of meters and also vary in diameter depending on the plant type Stems are usually above ground although
the stems of some plants such as the potato also grow underground Stems may be herbaceous soft or
woody in nature Their main function is to provide support to the plant holding leaves flowers and buds in some
cases stems also store food for the plant A stem may be unbranched like that of a palm tree or it may be
highly branched like that of a magnolia tree The stem of the plant connects the roots to the leaves helping to
transport absorbed water and minerals to different parts of the plant It also helps to transport the products of
photosynthesis namely sugars from the leaves to the rest of the plant
Plant stems whether above or below ground are characterized by the presence of nodes and internodes
Figure 304 Nodes are points of attachment for leaves aerial roots and flowers The stem region between
two nodes is called an internode The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole An
axillary bud is usually found in the axilthe area between the base of a leaf and the stemwhere it can give
rise to a branch or a flower The apex tip of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud
