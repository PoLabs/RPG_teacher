the surrounding tissue will decline water will move into the cell by osmosis and p will increase p is also
under indirect plant control via the opening and closing of stomata Stomatal openings allow water to evaporate
from the leaf reducing p and total of the leaf and increasing  between the water in the leaf and the petiole
thereby allowing water to flow from the petiole into the leaf
Figure 3033 When a total water potential total is lower outside the cells than inside water moves out of the cells
and the plant wilts When b the total water potential is higher outside the plant cells than inside water moves into the
cells resulting in turgor pressure p and keeping the plant erect credit modification of work by Victor M Vicente

Gravity Potential
Gravity potential g is always negative to zero in a plant with no height It always removes or consumes
potential energy from the system The force of gravity pulls water downwards to the soil reducing the total
amount of potential energy in the water in the plant total The taller the plant the taller the water column
and the more influential g becomes On a cellular scale and in short plants this effect is negligible and easily
ignored However over the height of a tall tree like a giant coastal redwood the gravitational pull of 01 MPa
m1 is equivalent to an extra 1 MPa of resistance that must be overcome for water to reach the leaves of the
tallest trees Plants are unable to manipulate g
Matric Potential
Matric potential m is always negative to zero In a dry system it can be as low as 2 MPa in a dry seed and
it is zero in a watersaturated system The binding of water to a matrix always removes or consumes potential
energy from the system m is similar to solute potential because it involves tying up the energy in an aqueous
system by forming hydrogen bonds between the water and some other component However in solute potential
the other components are soluble hydrophilic solute molecules whereas in m the other components are
insoluble hydrophilic molecules of the plant cell wall Every plant cell has a cellulosic cell wall and the cellulose
in the cell walls is hydrophilic producing a matrix for adhesion of water hence the name matric potential m is
very large negative in dry tissues such as seeds or droughtaffected soils However it quickly goes to zero as
the seed takes up water or the soil hydrates m cannot be manipulated by the plant and is typically ignored in
wellwatered roots stems and leaves
Movement of Water and Minerals in the Xylem
Solutes pressure gravity and matric potential are all important for the transport of water in plants Water moves
from an area of higher total water potential higher Gibbs free energy to an area of lower total water potential
Gibbs free energy is the energy associated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work This is
expressed as 
Transpiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface It is the main driver
of water movement in the xylem Transpiration is caused by the evaporation of water at the leafatmosphere
interface it creates negative pressure tension equivalent to 2 MPa at the leaf surface This value varies
greatly depending on the vapor pressure deficit which can be negligible at high relative humidity RH and
substantial at low RH Water from the roots is pulled up by this tension At night when stomata shut and
transpiration stops the water is held in the stem and leaf by the adhesion of water to the cell walls of the xylem
vessels and tracheids and the cohesion of water molecules to each other This is called the cohesiontension
