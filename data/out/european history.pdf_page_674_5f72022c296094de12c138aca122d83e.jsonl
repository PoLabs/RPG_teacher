Conclusion
In spite of all the regional and chronological differences all parts of Europe 
witnessed the same structural economic changes throughout the twentieth 
century the rise of industry and services at the expense of agriculture the 
birth of mass production the shift from consumptive shortages to abundance 
as well as the interdependence between Europe and the rest of the world 
However while the Western European countries focused on the economic 
development of light industry dedicated to supply growing community 
needs the Sovietbloc countries prioritised development of heavy industry 
to secure their defence military needs It is worth noting that the market 
potential which appeared in Eastern Europe after the regime change in 1989
1990 brought unprecedented sale and investment opportunities as there was 
an acute shortage in practically every sphere of the consumer segment
The collapse of socialist economy left consumers without any distribution 
and retail network This gap was immediately filled with global players 
whose expertise and international supply network were unreachable for any 
domestic competition This move turned out to be of advantage to consumers 
as they could enjoy competitive prices At the same time it put producers in 
an inferior position in negotiating sale prices of their goods In some cases the 
financial success of some distributors was greater abroad than in their own 
country of origin 
At present European producers have chosen a model of market growth 
based upon seeking regions with lower production costs which is why China 
became an important production centre for the European market giants The 
global market was no invention of the twentieth century but particularly 
since the end of the Second World War globalisation impacted economies 
worldwide on an unprecedented scale
Discussion questions
1	
What were the most important differences between capitalist and 
socialist production
2	
Why did taste become so important in consumer societies in the 
twentieth century
3	
In which ways did the production and consumption regimes of the 
twentieth century still shape European society
