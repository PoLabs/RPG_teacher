Figure 616 According to the inducedfit model both enzyme and substrate undergo dynamic conformational changes
upon binding The enzyme contorts the substrate into its transition state thereby increasing the reactions rate
Metabolism Control Through Enzyme Regulation
It would seem ideal to have a scenario in which all the encoded enzymes in an organisms genome existed in
abundant supply and functioned optimally under all cellular conditions in all cells at all times In reality this is
far from the case A variety of mechanisms ensure that this does not happen Cellular needs and conditions vary
from cell to cell and change within individual cells over time The required enzymes and energetic demands of
stomach cells are different from those of fat storage cells skin cells blood cells and nerve cells Furthermore a
digestive cell works much harder to process and break down nutrients during the time that closely follows a meal
compared with many hours after a meal As these cellular demands and conditions vary so do the amounts and
functionality of different enzymes
Since the rates of biochemical reactions are controlled by activation energy and enzymes lower and determine
activation energies for chemical reactions the relative amounts and functioning of the variety of enzymes
within a cell ultimately determine which reactions will proceed and at which rates This determination is tightly
controlled In certain cellular environments environmental factors like pH and temperature partly control enzyme
activity There are other mechanisms through which cells control enzyme activity and determine the rates at
which various biochemical reactions will occur
Molecular Regulation of Enzymes
Enzymes can be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce their activity There are many different kinds
of molecules that inhibit or promote enzyme function and various mechanisms exist for doing so For example
in some cases of enzyme inhibition an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to
the active site and simply block the substrate from binding When this happens the enzyme is inhibited through
competitive inhibition because an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for active site binding
Figure 617 Alternatively in noncompetitive inhibition an inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location
other than an allosteric site a binding site away from the active site and still manages to block substrate binding
to the active site
