203 WORKING WITH DATA
In the days of traditional media actionable data was a highly desired but scarce commodity 
While it was possible to broadly understand consumer responses to marketing messages it 
was often hard to pinpoint exactly what was happeningand why 
In the digital age information is absolutely everywhere Every single action taken online is 
recorded which means there is an incredible wealth of data available to marketers to help 
them understand when where how and even why users react to their marketing campaigns 
This also means there is a responsibility on marketers to make datadriven decisions that 
inform tactics and plans Assumptions and gut feel are not enough you need to back these 
up with solid facts and clear results 
Dont worry if youre not a numbers person because working with data is very little about 
number crunching the technology usually takes care of this for you and a lot about analysing 
experimenting testing and questioning All you need is a curious mind and an understanding 
of the key principles and tools Data concepts that you should be aware of include performance 
monitoring trends big data and data mining Lets look at each of these
2031 Performance monitoring and trends
Data analytics are all about monitoring user behaviour and marketing campaign performance 
over time The last part is crucial There is little value in looking at a single point of data You 
need to look at trends and changes over a set period to encourage a dynamic view of data
