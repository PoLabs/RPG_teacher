Cell signaling using Gproteinlinked receptors occurs as a cyclic series of events Before the ligand binds
the inactive Gprotein can bind to a newly revealed site on the receptor specific for its binding Once the G
protein binds to the receptor the resulting change in shape activates the Gprotein which releases guanosine
diposphate GDP and picks up guanosine 3phosphate GTP The subunits of the Gprotein then split into the
 subunit and the  subunit One or both of these Gprotein fragments may be able to activate other proteins as
a result After awhile the GTP on the active  subunit of the Gprotein is hydrolyzed to GDP and the  subunit
is deactivated The subunits reassociate to form the inactive Gprotein and the cycle begins anew
Figure 96 Heterotrimeric Gproteins have three subunits   and  When a signaling molecule binds to a Gprotein
coupled receptor in the plasma membrane a GDP molecule associated with the  subunit is exchanged for GTP The
 and  subunits dissociate from the  subunit and a cellular response is triggered either by the  subunit or the
dissociated  pair Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP terminates the signal
Gproteinlinked receptors have been extensively studied and much has been learned about their roles in
maintaining health Bacteria that are pathogenic to humans can release poisons that interrupt specific Gprotein
linked receptor function leading to illnesses such as pertussis botulism and cholera In cholera Figure 97
for example the waterborne bacterium Vibrio cholerae produces a toxin choleragen that binds to cells lining
the small intestine The toxin then enters these intestinal cells where it modifies a Gprotein that controls the
opening of a chloride channel and causes it to remain continuously active resulting in large losses of fluids from
the body and potentially fatal dehydration as a result
