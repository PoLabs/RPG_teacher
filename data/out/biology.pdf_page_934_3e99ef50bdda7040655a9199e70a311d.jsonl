Plant Adaptations in ResourceDeficient Environments
Roots stems and leaves are structured to ensure that a plant can obtain the required sunlight water soil
nutrients and oxygen resources Some remarkable adaptations have evolved to enable plant species to
thrive in less than ideal habitats where one or more of these resources is in short supply
In tropical rainforests light is often scarce since many trees and plants grow close together and block much
of the sunlight from reaching the forest floor Many tropical plant species have exceptionally broad leaves to
maximize the capture of sunlight Other species are epiphytes plants that grow on other plants that serve
as a physical support Such plants are able to grow high up in the canopy atop the branches of other trees
where sunlight is more plentiful Epiphytes live on rain and minerals collected in the branches and leaves
of the supporting plant Bromeliads members of the pineapple family ferns and orchids are examples of
tropical epiphytes Figure 3028 Many epiphytes have specialized tissues that enable them to efficiently
capture and store water

oak tree credit Kristine Paulus
Some plants have special adaptations that help them to survive in nutrientpoor environments Carnivorous
plants such as the Venus flytrap and the pitcher plant Figure 3029 grow in bogs where the soil is low
in nitrogen In these plants leaves are modified to capture insects The insectcapturing leaves may have
evolved to provide these plants with a supplementary source of muchneeded nitrogen
