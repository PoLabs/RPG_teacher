The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle
who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a wind
fall or of a catastrophe Then he stepped into the
cab and in half an hour we were back in the sitting
room at Baker Street Nothing had been said during
our drive but the high thin breathing of our new
companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his
hands spoke of the nervous tension within him
Here we are said Holmes cheerily as we led
into the room The re looks very seasonable in this
weather You look cold Mr Ryder Pray take the
basketchair I will just put on my slippers before we
settle this little matter of yours Now then You want
to know what became of those geese
Yes sir
Or rather I fancy of that goose It was one bird
I imagine in which you were interestedwhite with
a black bar across the tail
Ryder quivered with emotion Oh sir he cried
can you tell me where it went to
It came here
Here
Yes and a most remarkable bird it proved I
dont wonder that you should take an interest in it It
laid an egg after it was deadthe bonniest brightest
little blue egg that ever was seen I have it here in my
museum
Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the
mantelpiece with his right hand Holmes unlocked
his strongbox and held up the blue carbuncle which
shone out like a star with a cold brilliant many
pointed radiance Ryder stood glaring with a drawn
face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it
The games up Ryder said Holmes quietly
Hold up man or youll be into the re Give him an
arm back into his chair Watson Hes not got blood
enough to go in for felony with impunity Give him
a dash of brandy So Now he looks a little more
human What a shrimp it is to be sure
For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen
but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his
cheeks and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his
accuser
I have almost every link in my hands and all the
proofs which I could possibly need so there is little
which you need tell me Still that little may as well
be cleared up to make the case complete You had
heard Ryder of this blue stone of the Countess of
Morcars
It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it said
he in a crackling voice
I seeher ladyships waitingmaid Well the
temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was
too much for you as it has been for better men be
fore you but you were not very scrupulous in the
means you used It seems to me Ryder that there
is the making of a very pretty villain in you You
knew that this man Horner the plumber had been
concerned in some such matter before and that suspi
cion would rest the more readily upon him What did
you do then You made some small job in my ladys
roomyou and your confederate Cusackand you
managed that he should be the man sent for Then
when he had left you ried the jewelcase raised the
alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested You
then
Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug
and clutched at my companions knees For Gods
sake have mercy he shrieked Think of my father
Of my mother It would break their hearts I never
went wrong before I never will again I swear it Ill
swear it on a Bible Oh dont bring it into court For
Christs sake dont
Get back into your chair said Holmes sternly
It is very well to cringe and crawl now but you
thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock
for a crime of which he knew nothing
I will y Mr Holmes I will leave the country sir
Then the charge against him will break down
Hum We will talk about that And now let us
hear a true account of the next act How came the
stone into the goose and how came the goose into
the open market Tell us the truth for there lies your
only hope of safety
Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips
I will tell you it just as it happened sir said he
When Horner had been arrested it seemed to me
that it would be best for me to get away with the
stone at once for I did not know at what moment the
police might not take it into their heads to search me
and my room There was no place about the hotel
where it would be safe I went out as if on some com
mission and I made for my sisters house She had
married a man named Oakshott and lived in Brixton
Road where she fattened fowls for the market All
the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a
policeman or a detective and for all that it was a cold
night the sweat was pouring down my face before I
came to the Brixton Road My sister asked me what
was the matter and why I was so pale but I told her
that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel
Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe
and wondered what it would be best to do
