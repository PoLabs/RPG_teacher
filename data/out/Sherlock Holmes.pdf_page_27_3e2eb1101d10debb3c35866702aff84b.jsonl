The RedHeaded League
happy to look into it From what you have told me I
think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
it than might at rst sight appear
Grave enough said Mr Jabez Wilson Why I
have lost four pound a week
As far as you are personally concerned re
marked Holmes I do not see that you have any
grievance against this extraordinary league On the
contrary you are as I understand richer by some 30
to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you
have gained on every subject which comes under the
letter A You have lost nothing by them
No sir But I want to nd out about them and
who they are and what their object was in playing
this prankif it was a prankupon me It was a
pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two
and thirty pounds
We shall endeavour to clear up these points for
you And rst one or two questions Mr Wilson
This assistant of yours who rst called your attention
to the advertisementhow long had he been with
you
About a month then
How did he come
In answer to an advertisement
Was he the only applicant
No I had a dozen
Why did you pick him
Because he was handy and would come cheap
At halfwages in fact
Yes
What is he like this Vincent Spaulding
Small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair
on his face though hes not short of thirty Has a
white splash of acid upon his forehead
Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excite
ment I thought as much said he Have you ever
observed that his ears are pierced for earrings
Yes sir He told me that a gipsy had done it for
him when he was a lad
Hum said Holmes sinking back in deep
thought He is still with you
Oh yes sir I have only just left him
And has your business been attended to in your
absence
Nothing to complain of sir Theres never very
much to do of a morning
That will do Mr Wilson I shall be happy to give
you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a
day or two Today is Saturday and I hope that by
Monday we may come to a conclusion
Well Watson said Holmes when our visitor had
left us what do you make of it all
I make nothing of it I answered frankly It is a
most mysterious business
As a rule said Holmes the more bizarre a
thing is the less mysterious it proves to be It is your
commonplace featureless crimes which are really puz
zling just as a commonplace face is the most difcult
to identify But I must be prompt over this matter
What are you going to do then I asked
To smoke he answered It is quite a three pipe
problem and I beg that you wont speak to me for
fty minutes He curled himself up in his chair with
his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose and
there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay
pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird
I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped
asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he
suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of
a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe
down upon the mantelpiece
Sarasate plays at the St Jamess Hall this after
noon he remarked What do you think Watson
Could your patients spare you for a few hours
I have nothing to do today My practice is never
very absorbing
Then put on your hat and come I am going
through the City rst and we can have some lunch
on the way I observe that there is a good deal of Ger
man music on the programme which is rather more
to my taste than Italian or French It is introspective
and I want to introspect Come along
We travelled by the Underground as far as Alders
gate and a short walk took us to SaxeCoburg Square
the scene of the singular story which we had listened
to in the morning It was a poky little shabbygenteel
place where four lines of dingy twostoried brick
houses looked out into a small railedin enclosure
where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps
of faded laurelbushes made a hard ght against a
smokeladen and uncongenial atmosphere
Three
gilt balls and a brown board with Jabez Wilson
in white letters upon a corner house announced
the place where our redheaded client carried on
his business Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of
it with his head on one side and looked it all over
with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
Then he walked slowly up the street and then down
