Figure 39 Amylose and amylopectin are two different starch forms Unbranched glucose monomer chains comprise
amylose by  14 glycosidic linkages Unbranched glucose monomer chains comprise amylopectin by  14 and  16
glycosidic linkages Because of the way the subunits are joined the glucose chains have a helical structure Glycogen
not shown is similar in structure to amylopectin but more highly branched
Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates and is comprised of monomers of
glucose Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and
muscle cells Whenever blood glucose levels decrease glycogen breaks down to release glucose in a process
scientists call glycogenolysis
Cellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer Cellulose mostly comprises a plants cell wall This provides
the cell structural support Wood and paper are mostly cellulosic in nature Glucose monomers comprise
cellulose that  14 glycosidic bonds link Figure 310
