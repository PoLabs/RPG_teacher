By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe nucleic acids structure and define the two types of nucleic acids

Explain DNAs structure and role

Explain RNAs structure and roles
Nucleic acids are the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life They carry the cells genetic
blueprint and carry instructions for its functioning
DNA and RNA
The two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid DNA and ribonucleic acid RNA DNA is
the genetic material in all living organisms ranging from singlecelled bacteria to multicellular mammals It is in
the nucleus of eukaryotes and in the organelles chloroplasts and mitochondria In prokaryotes the DNA is not
enclosed in a membranous envelope
The cells entire genetic content is its genome and the study of genomes is genomics In eukaryotic cells but
not in prokaryotes DNA forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin the substance of eukaryotic
chromosomes A chromosome may contain tens of thousands of genes Many genes contain the information to
make protein products Other genes code for RNA products DNA controls all of the cellular activities by turning
the genes on or off
The other type of nucleic acid RNA is mostly involved in protein synthesis The DNA molecules never leave
the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell This intermediary is the
messenger RNA mRNA Other types of RNAlike rRNA tRNA and microRNAare involved in protein
synthesis and its regulation
DNA and RNA are comprised of monomers that scientists call nucleotides The nucleotides combine with each
other to form a polynucleotide DNA or RNA Three components comprise each nucleotide a nitrogenous base
a pentose fivecarbon sugar and a phosphate group Figure 331 Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is
attached to a sugar molecule which is attached to one or more phosphate groups
