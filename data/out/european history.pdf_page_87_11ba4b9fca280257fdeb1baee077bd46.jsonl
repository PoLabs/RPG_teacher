German and Dutch Anabaptists in the 1520s to the Quakers in the following 
century Most of them survived in disguise thousands of them perished 
and tens of thousands fled abroad where they were regularly tolerated as a 
foreign religious minority ie a diaspora The Principality of Transylvania 
an Ottoman vassal but with complete internal freedom deserves special 
attention uniquely in Europe four confessions Catholic Lutheran Reformed 
Unitarian were officially accepted while Orthodox Christians and Greek 
Catholics were allowed to practise their faith as were Jews and other religious 
minorities including radical Protestants such as Anabaptists and Sabbatarians 
who were expelled from almost everywhere else in Europe
More generally however religious diasporas became an important 
phenomenon in early modern Europemore so than in other historical 
periods or places There were three reasons for this first the highly fragmented 
political and confessional landscape created spaces for persecuted minorities 
often coupled with rulers interests in profiting financially economically and 
politically from their admission thus for example the brain drain occasioned 
by the Huguenot exodus benefited the host societies while weakening an 
otherwise dominant France Second there was a peculiar mixture in early 
modern Europes treatment of religious dissidents on the one hand they 
were considered dangerous threats to a societys religious puritywhich 
led to regular persecutions and expulsions On the other hand religious 
dissidents were partially tolerated for economic and political reasons allowing 
persecuted minorities to settle elsewhere Third late medieval spirituality and 
the intellectual quest for the true interpretation of the Bible fully unleashed 
by Luthers Reformation engendered an unprecedented degree of religious 
pluralisation both within Christianity and Judaism with each confessional 
variety claiming to offer the one and only way to salvation In this way 
religion in a very specific subdenominational form was and remained well 
into the eighteenth century the mainstay of peoples daily aspirations As a 
consequence a specific creed was also a sufficient motive to leave everything
sometimes even including ones familybehind and to risk ones life in a 
foreign and potentially hostile environment where this creed would become 
even more important as the core of ones identity
In addition to this common background early modern religious diasporas 
shared a number of particular features Their members often developed 
innovative economic skills and were commercially very successful they 
displayed high levels of moral and workrelated discipline as well as high 
degrees of literacy and education notably including women they were 
generally more egalitarian than the surrounding majority societies Finally 
undergirding their economic success they maintained strong networks with 
diaspora groups of the same creed All of these characteristics were present 
in otherwise very diverse Jewish communities Calvinist and other radical
