I might get lucky again
Hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her
arms around him
Hermione
Harry  youre a great wizard you know
Im not as good as you said Harry very embarrassed as she let go of
him
Me said Hermione Books And cleverness There are more important
things  friendship and bravery and  oh Harry  be careful
You drink first said Harry You are sure which is which arent
you
Positive said Hermione She took a long drink from the round bottle
at the end and shuddered
Its not poison said Harry anxiously
No  but its like ice
Quick go before it wears off
Good luck  take care
GO
Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle He turned to
face the black flames
Here I come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp
It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body He put the bottle
down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking
his body but couldnt feel them  for a moment he could see nothing
but dark fire  then he was on the other side in the last chamber
