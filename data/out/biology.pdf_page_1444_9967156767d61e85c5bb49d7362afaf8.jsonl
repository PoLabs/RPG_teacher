Figure 4524 Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum grow well individually but when they compete for the
same resources the P aurelia outcompetes the P caudatum
This exclusion may be avoided if a population evolves to make use of a different resource a different area of the
habitat or feeds during a different time of day called resource partitioning The two organisms are then said to
occupy different microniches These organisms coexist by minimizing direct competition
Symbiosis
Symbiotic relationships or symbioses plural are close interactions between individuals of different species
over an extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations
Most scientists accept this definition but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic where
both individuals benefit from the interaction In this discussion the broader definition will be used
Commensalism
A commensal relationship occurs when one species benefits from the close prolonged interaction while the
other neither benefits nor is harmed Birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship
Figure 4525 The tree is not harmed by the presence of the nest among its branches The nests are light
and produce little strain on the structural integrity of the branch and most of the leaves which the tree uses to
get energy by photosynthesis are above the nest so they are unaffected The bird on the other hand benefits
greatly If the bird had to nest in the open its eggs and young would be vulnerable to predators Another example
of a commensal relationship is the clown fish and the sea anemone The sea anemone is not harmed by the fish
and the fish benefits with protection from predators who would be stung upon nearing the sea anemone
