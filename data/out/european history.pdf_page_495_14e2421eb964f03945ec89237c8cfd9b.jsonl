European person lived in a city but by 1900 every third European dwelled 
in an urban settlement This unprecedented growth increased the European 
urban population from less than 20 million to 110 million people The 
proportion of urban population and the scale of its growth in absolute terms 
differed from one region to the other England and the Low Countries were 
the most urbanised territories whereas Southeastern Europe Scandinavia 
and Switzerland remained the least urbanised London as the first city with 
more than one million inhabitants in the 1800s remained the largest city in 
the nineteenth century with a population above five million by 1900 Paris 
was the first continental city that reached the population of one million in the 
1830s followed by Berlin Istanbul Saint Petersburg Moscow and Vienna in 
the second half of the nineteenth century
Urbanisation as a demographic process did not only take place in these large 
cities but also in mediumsized and smaller cities and towns which together 
gradually established an urban hierarchy on an increasing proportion of the 
territory of Europe Nineteenthcentury urban planning was characterised by 
the question of how to handle this spectacular migration to urban settings 
which required urgent solutions in an increasingly complex and coherent 
urban system in which the exchange of information was accelerating very 
fast In the late nineteenth century the concrete embodiments of the shared 
andor imposed norms of urban planning varied from the easily perceptible 
institutions of central power in France city halls courts of law post offices 
and schools to similar railway stations in the cities of AustriaHungary as 
well as the monuments to great personalities mushrooming all over Europe
Nineteenthcentury cities were the products of accelerated industrialisation 
and commercialisation and they necessitated systematic management 
Providing that systematic management stretched the representative capacity 
and the regulative power of nowoutdated eighteenthcentury governing 
institutions to its limits Although the institutionalisation of professional 
urban planning began only at the very end of the nineteenth century with 
the publishing of Ebenezer Howards book about the Garden City movement 
1898 and the foundation of the first Town and City Planning Association 
1899 in the United Kingdom the history of preprofessional urban planning 
can be traced back through significant interventions of urban renewal and 
through initiatives to create liveable industrial settlements see Figure 1
One of the major challenges for the fastgrowing cities was the 
transformation of cramped medieval cores and street structures into large 
arteries of boulevards and avenues which were suitable not only for operating 
the increasing inner traffic but also for linking urban transport networks 
to the extended national ones Important examples of such reconstruction 
were renewals designed in London 18481865 Paris 18531869 Vienna
