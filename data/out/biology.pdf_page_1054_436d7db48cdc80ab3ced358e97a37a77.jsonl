Figure 3412 Villi are folds on the small intestine lining that increase the surface area to facilitate the absorption
of nutrients
Which of the following statements about the small intestine is false
a
Absorptive cells that line the small intestine have microvilli small projections that increase surface area
and aid in the absorption of food
b
The inside of the small intestine has many folds called villi
c
Microvilli are lined with blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels
d
The inside of the small intestine is called the lumen
The human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts the duodenum the jejunum and the
ileum The Cshaped fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in Figure 3411
The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from
the stomach to the duodenum In the duodenum chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution
rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of chyme and acts as a buffer Pancreatic juices also contain
several digestive enzymes Digestive juices from the pancreas liver and gallbladder as well as from gland cells
of the intestinal wall itself enter the duodenum Bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the
gallbladder Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize
starches disaccharides proteins and fats These digestive juices breakdown the food particles in the chyme
into glucose triglycerides and amino acids Some chemical digestion of food takes place in the duodenum
Absorption of fatty acids also takes place in the duodenum
The second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum shown in Figure 3411 Here hydrolysis of nutrients
is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining The
bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum
The ileum also illustrated in Figure 3411 is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and
vitamins are absorbed into the bloodstream The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via
peristaltic movements of the muscle The ileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve The
vermiform wormlike appendix is located at the ileocecal valve The appendix of humans secretes no enzymes
and has an insignificant role in immunity
Large Intestine
The large intestine illustrated in Figure 3413 reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and
processes the waste material The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small
intestine but larger in diameter It has three parts the cecum the colon and the rectum The cecum joins the
ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch for the waste matter The colon is home to many bacteria or
intestinal flora that aid in the digestive processes The colon can be divided into four regions the ascending
