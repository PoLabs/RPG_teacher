Conclusion
Across Europe higher education adopted a relatively uniform humanist 
paradigm in the sixteenth century Although this paradigm survived the 
scientific revolution and continued to shape students during their first years 
at universities the liberal artsinformed by history philology and rhetoric
failed to hold their ground alongside the emancipation of natural sciences The 
development of atomistic Cartesian Newtonian and Leibnizian metaphysics 
rendered the Greek and Roman tradition outdated It was not until the modern 
age that a combination of Kantianism and a neohumanistic study of antiquity 
accompanied the rise of a new type of research university which spread from 
Germany to the rest of the continent
The institutional landscape was in broad terms largely the same across 
Europe a secondary tier prepared students for a tertiary education based 
on scholastic and humanist learning rooted in a productive combination 
of GrecoRoman and Christian traditions which were also shaped in many 
ways by Arabic and Jewish scholarship Latin was important as a European 
lingua franca despite the rise of Italian in the sixteenth century and French 
in the seventeenth century What is particularly striking is the high number 
of schools relatively small towns harboured Latin schools that might not 
have attracted many students but that were symbols of cultural capital for 
communities that wished to elevate themselves in the regional competition for 
power Although confessional differences hampered institutional exchange 
and universities as a rule did not appoint professors of different religious 
backgrounds universities generally accepted students of other confessions 
The wide array of topics that were understood to be part of the artes along 
with the three higher faculties of theology law and medicine offered a rich 
body of skills and ideas With the overarching frames of Christendom and 
classical tradition ensuring a common frame of reference learning might have 
appeared conservative locally but from a birdseye view the educational 
landscape was rich and variegated creating a relatively open market for ideas
