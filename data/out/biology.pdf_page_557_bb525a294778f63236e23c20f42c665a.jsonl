Figure 2011 All the organisms within a clade stem from a single point on the tree A clade may contain multiple
groups as in the case of animals fungi and plants or a single group as in the case of flagellates Groups that
diverge at a different branch point or that do not include all groups in a single branch point are not clades
What is the largest clade in this diagram
Shared Characteristics
Organisms evolve from common ancestors and then diversify Scientists use the phrase descent with
modification because even though related organisms have many of the same characteristics and genetic codes
changes occur This pattern repeats as one goes through the phylogenetic tree of life
1
A change in an organisms genetic makeup leads to a new trait which becomes prevalent in the group
2
Many organisms descend from this point and have this trait
3
New variations continue to arise some are adaptive and persist leading to new traits
4
With new traits a new branch point is determined go back to step 1 and repeat
If a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group it is considered a shared ancestral character because
all of the organisms in the taxon or clade have that trait The vertebrate in Figure 2010 is a shared ancestral
character Now consider the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure Only some of the organisms in
Figure 2010 have this trait and to those that do it is called a shared derived character because this trait
derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree
The tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is that these terms are relative We can
consider the same trait one or the other depending on the particular diagram that we use Returning to Figure
2010 note that the amniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for the Amniota clade while having hair is
a shared derived character for some organisms in this group These terms help scientists distinguish between
clades in building phylogenetic trees
