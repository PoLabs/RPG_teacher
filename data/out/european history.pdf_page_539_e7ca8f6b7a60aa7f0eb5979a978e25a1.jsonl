The dynamics of forced migration began to affect the academic world 
This crystallised after the 1917 Russian Revolution which drove a wave of 
emigration of artists and scientists from Russia to Western European capitals 
such as Prague Berlin and Paris up until the mid1920s One landmark of this 
brain drain was the action taken in 19221923 by the socalled philosophers 
steamboats which transported over 200 leading intellectuals who had been 
expelled from Soviet Russia due to their ideological backgrounds 
The Second World War and Postwar Europe
The totalitarian ideology of National Socialism and the Second World War 
unleashed by its adherents led to an existential crisis not only for international 
cooperation but for the entire European educational research and cultural 
sphere During the war academic cooperation in Europe could scarcely be 
maintained Although international scientific events were held in areas 
occupied by the Nazis these were primarily held for propaganda purposes 
For example Werner Heisenberg a German nuclear physicist and 1932 
Nobel Prize winner was sent during the war to the occupied territories to 
propagate a positive image of German culture under the Nazi regime The 
consequences for universities were enormous Still they tended to be more 
drastic for the universities of Eastern and Southern Europe than for those in 
Western and Northern Europe In France under the Vichy regime nonJewish 
students and teachers were able to follow an apparently normal university
