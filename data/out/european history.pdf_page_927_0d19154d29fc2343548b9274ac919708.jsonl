Introduction
The twentieth century was characterised by a great expansion of free time
time that was not taken up by work or other duties and was at the disposal 
of individuals to fill as they pleased Through changes in legislation and 
technological developments ever greater parts of the population in Europe 
could enjoy this privilege of free time However it is uncertain how free 
people really were in their choices of leisure activities Throughout the 
twentieth century modern pressures and social constraints like selfcontrol or 
body image shaped the ways that free time was spent in Europe
Freeing up Time Modern Experiences of Sport and 
Leisure in the Twentieth Century
The concept of leisure is an invention of modern times which began to 
develop in the midnineteenth century In the twentieth century a greater 
number of people gained access to free time which they spent on different 
types of leisure activities The democratisation of leisure was made possible 
when trade unions started to contest the long working hours of the working 
classes and gradually achieved the regulation of the day into eight hours of 
work eight hours of sleep and eight hours of free time As a growing group 
of people thus gained the opportunity to use their spare hours as they wished 
questions arose about how free time could and should be spent
