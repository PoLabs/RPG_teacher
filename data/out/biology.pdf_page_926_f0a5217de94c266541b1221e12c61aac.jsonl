elongation and a zone of maturation and differentiation Figure 3016 The zone of cell division is closest to
the root tip it is made up of the actively dividing cells of the root meristem The zone of elongation is where the
newly formed cells increase in length thereby lengthening the root Beginning at the first root hair is the zone
of cell maturation where the root cells begin to differentiate into special cell types All three zones are in the first
centimeter or so of the root tip
Figure 3016 A longitudinal view of the root reveals the zones of cell division elongation and maturation Cell division
occurs in the apical meristem
The root has an outer layer of cells called the epidermis which surrounds areas of ground tissue and vascular
tissue The epidermis provides protection and helps in absorption Root hairs which are extensions of root
epidermal cells increase the surface area of the root greatly contributing to the absorption of water and
minerals
Inside the root the ground tissue forms two regions the cortex and the pith Figure 3017 Compared to stems
roots have lots of cortex and little pith Both regions include cells that store photosynthetic products The cortex
is between the epidermis and the vascular tissue whereas the pith lies between the vascular tissue and the
center of the root

Sclerenchyma cells of the exodermis and xylem cells stain red and phloem cells stain blue Other cell types stain
black The stele or vascular tissue is the area inside endodermis indicated by a green ring Root hairs are visible
outside the epidermis credit scalebar data from Matt Russell
The vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root which is called the stele Figure
