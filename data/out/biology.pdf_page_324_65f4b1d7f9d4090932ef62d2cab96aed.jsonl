Figure 115 The process of chromosome alignment differs between meiosis I and meiosis II In prometaphase I
microtubules attach to the fused kinetochores of homologous chromosomes and the homologous chromosomes are
arranged at the midline of the cell the metaphase plate in metaphase I In anaphase I the homologous chromosomes
separate In prometaphase II microtubules attach to the kinetochores of sister chromatids and the sister chromatids
are arranged at the midpoint of the cells in metaphase II In anaphase II the sister chromatids separate
Telophase II and Cytokinesis
The chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense Nuclear envelopes form around the
chromosomes If the parent cell was diploid as is most commonly the case then cytokinesis now separates
the two cells into four unique haploid cells The cells produced are genetically unique because of the random
assortment of paternal and maternal homologs and because of the recombination of maternal and paternal
segments of chromosomes with their sets of genes that occurs during crossover The entire process of meiosis
is outlined in Figure 116
