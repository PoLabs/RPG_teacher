Comparing Meiosis and Mitosis
Mitosis and meiosis are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells They share some similarities
but also exhibit a number of important and distinct differences that lead to very different outcomes Figure 117
Mitosis is a single nuclear division that results in two nuclei that are usually partitioned into two new cells The
nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically identical to the original nucleus They have the same
number of sets of chromosomes one set in the case of haploid cells and two sets in the case of diploid cells
In contrast meiosis consists of two nuclear divisions resulting in four nuclei that are usually partitioned into four
new genetically distinct cells The four nuclei produced during meiosis are not genetically identical and they
contain one chromosome set only This is half the number of chromosome sets in the original cell which is
