22  Water
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the properties of water that are critical to maintaining life

Explain why water is an excellent solvent

Provide examples of waters cohesive and adhesive properties

Discuss the role of acids bases and buffers in homeostasis
Why do scientists spend time looking for water on other planets Why is water so important It is because water
is essential to life as we know it Water is one of the more abundant molecules and the one most critical to life
on Earth Water comprises approximately 6070 percent of the human body Without it life as we know it simply
would not exist
The polarity of the water molecule and its resulting hydrogen bonding make water a unique substance with
special properties that are intimately tied to the processes of life Life originally evolved in a watery environment
and most of an organisms cellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery contents of the cells
cytoplasm Special properties of water are its high heat capacity and heat of vaporization its ability to dissolve
polar molecules its cohesive and adhesive properties and its dissociation into ions that leads to generating pH
Understanding these characteristics of water helps to elucidate its importance in maintaining life
Waters Polarity
One of waters important properties is that it is composed of polar molecules the hydrogen and oxygen within
water molecules H2O form polar covalent bonds While there is no net charge to a water molecule waters
polarity creates a slightly positive charge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen contributing
to waters properties of attraction Water generates charges because oxygen is more electronegative than
hydrogen making it more likely that a shared electron would be near the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen
nucleus thus generating the partial negative charge near the oxygen
As a result of waters polarity each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite
charges between water molecules forming hydrogen bonds Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar
molecules and ions We call a polar substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water hydrophilic
hydro  water philic  loving In contrast nonpolar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with
water as Figure 213 shows A good example of this is vinegar and oil salad dressing an acidic water solution
We call such nonpolar compounds hydrophobic hydro  water phobic  fearing
