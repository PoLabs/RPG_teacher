The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate
The Lord of the Eagles would not take them anywhere near where men lived
They would shoot at us with their great bows of yew he said for they would
think we were after their sheep And at other times they would be right No we
are glad to cheat the goblins of their sport and glad to repay our thanks to you
