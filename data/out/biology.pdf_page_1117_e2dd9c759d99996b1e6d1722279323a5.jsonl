CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
24 How are neurons similar to other cells How are
they unique
25 Multiple sclerosis causes demyelination of axons
in the brain and spinal cord Why is this problematic
26 Many neurons have only a single axon but many
terminals at the end of the axon How does this end
structure of the axon support its function
27 How does myelin aid propagation of an action
potential along an axon How do the nodes of
Ranvier help this process
28 What are the main steps in chemical
neurotransmission
29 Describe how longterm potentiation can lead to a
nicotine addiction
30 What methods can be used to determine the
function of a particular brain region
31 What are the main functions of the spinal cord
32 Alzheimers disease involves three of the four
lobes of the brain Identify one of the involved lobes
and describe the lobes symptoms associated with
the disease
33 What are the main differences between the
sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the
autonomic nervous system
34 What are the main functions of the sensory
somatic nervous system
35 Describe how the sensorysomatic nervous
system reacts by reflex to a person touching
something hot How does this allow for rapid
responses in potentially dangerous situations
36 Scientists have suggested that the autonomic
nervous system is not welladapted to modern
human life How is the sympathetic nervous system
an ineffective response to the everyday challenges
faced by modern humans
37 What are the main symptoms of Alzheimers
disease
38 What are possible treatments for patients with
major depression
