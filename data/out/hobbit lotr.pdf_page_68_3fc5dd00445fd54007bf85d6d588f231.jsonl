Gollum was dreadfully disappointed but Bilbo asked another riddle as quick
as ever he could so that Gollum had to get back into his boat and think
Nolegs lay on oneleg twolegs sat near on threelegs fourlegs got some
It was not really the right time for this riddle but Bilbo was in a hurry
Gollum might have had some trouble guessing it if he had asked it at another
time As it was talking of fish nolegs was not so very difficult and after that
the rest was easy Fish on a little table man at table sitting on a stool the cat
has the bones that of course is the answer and Gollum soon gave it Then he
thought the time had come to ask something hard and horrible This is what he
said
This thing all things devours
Birds beasts trees flowers
Gnaws iron bites steel
Grinds hard stones to meal
Slays king ruins town
And beats high mountain down
Poor Bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants
and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales but not one of them had done all
these things He had a feeling that the answer was quite different and that he
ought to know it but he could not think of it He began to get frightened and
that is bad for thinking Gollum began to get out of his boat He flapped into the
water and paddled to the bank Bilbo could see his eyes coming towards him
His tongue seemed to stick in his mouth he wanted to shout out Give me more
time Give me time But all that came out with a sudden squeal was
Time Time
Bilbo was saved by pure luck For that of course was the answer
Gollum was disappointed once more and now he was getting angry and also
tired of the game It had made him very hungry indeed This time he did not go
back to the boat He sat down in the dark by Bilbo That made the hobbit most
dreadfully uncomfortable and scattered his wits
Its got to ask uss a quesstion my preciouss yes yess yesss Jusst one more
question to guess yes yess said Gollum
