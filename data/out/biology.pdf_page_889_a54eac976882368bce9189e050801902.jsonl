of birds such as pigeons parrots hawks and owls lack a uropygial gland but have specialized feathers that
disintegrate into a powdery down which serves the same purpose as the oils of the uropygial gland
Like mammals birds have 12 pairs of cranial nerves and a very large cerebellum and optic lobes but only a
single bone in the middle ear called the columella the stapes in mammals They have a closed circulatory
system with two atria and two ventricles but rather than a leftbending aortic arch like that of mammals
they have a rightbending aortic arch and nucleated red blood cells unlike the enucleated red blood cells of
mammals
All these unique and highly derived characteristics make birds one of the most conspicuous and successful
groups of vertebrate animals filling a range of ecological niches and ranging in size from the tiny bee
hummingbird of Cuba about 2 grams to the ostrich about 140000 grams Their large brains keen senses
and the abilities of many species to imitate vocalization and use tools make them some of the most intelligent
vertebrates on Earth
Evolution of Birds
Thanks to amazing new fossil discoveries in China the evolutionary history of birds has become clearer even
though bird bones do not fossilize as well as those of other vertebrates As weve seen earlier birds are highly
modified diapsids but rather than having two fenestrations or openings in their skulls behind the eye the skulls
of modern birds are so specialized that it is difficult to see any trace of the original diapsid condition
Birds belong to a group of diapsids called the archosaurs which includes three other groups living crocodilians
pterosaurs and dinosaurs Overwhelming evidence shows that birds evolved within the clade Dinosauria which
is further subdivided into two groups the Saurischia lizard hips and the Ornithischia bird hips Despite the
names of these groups it was not the birdhipped dinosaurs that gave rise to modern birds Rather Saurischia
diverged into two groups One included the longnecked herbivorous dinosaurs such as Apatosaurus The
second group bipedal predators called theropods gave rise to birds This course of evolution is highlighted by
numerous similarities between late maniraptoran theropod fossils and birds specifically in the structure of the
hip and wrist bones as well as the presence of the wishbone formed by the fusion of the clavicles
The clade Neornithes includes the avian crown group which comprises all living birds and the descendants
from their most recent common maniraptoran ancestor One wellknown and important fossil of an animal that
appears intermediate between dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx Figure 2935 which is from the Jurassic
period 200 to 145 MYA Archaeopteryx has characteristics of both maniraptoran dinosaurs and modern birds
Some scientists propose classifying it as a bird but others prefer to classify it as a dinosaur Traits in skeletons of
Archaeopteryx like those of a dinosaur included a jaw with teeth and a long bony tail Like birds it had feathers
modified for flight both on the forelimbs and on the tail a trait associated only with birds among modern animals
Fossils of older feathered dinosaurs exist but the feathers may not have had the characteristics of modern flight
feathers
Figure 2935 Archaeopteryx a Archaeopteryx lived in the late Jurassic period around 150 million years ago It had
cuplike thecodont teeth like a dinosaur but had b flight feathers like modern birds which can be seen in this fossil
Note the claws on the wings which are still found in a number of birds such as the newborn chicks of the South
American Hoatzin
