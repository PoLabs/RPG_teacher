Im serious Harry dont go
But Harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in
front of the mirror and Ron wasnt going to stop him
That third night he found his way more quickly than before He was
walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he
didnt meet anyone
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of
his grandfathers nodding happily Harry sank down to sit on the floor in
front of the mirror There was nothing to stop him from staying here all
night with his family Nothing at all
Except 
So  back again Harry
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice He looked behind
him Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus
Dumbledore Harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to
get to the mirror he hadnt noticed him
  I didnt see you sir
Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said Dumbledore
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling
So said Dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with
Harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of
the Mirror of Erised
I didnt know it was called that Sir
But I expect youve realized by now what it does
It  well  it shows me my family 
And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy
How did you know
