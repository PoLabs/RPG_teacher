and supporting the emerging Third World economically and politically 
they tried to use the momentum of decolonisation to get an upper hand in the 
global conflict
Nevertheless the USSR could be also viewed as an empire sui generis 
even though it does not fit with the classic understanding of the concept of 
colonialism associated mostly with the Western European overseas empires 
The USSR inherited most of the territories from tsarist Russia and despite 
its rhetoric and its nominally federal structure it remained very centralised 
with all power in the hands of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union The 
peripheral Soviet territories such as Central Asia remained underdeveloped 
long after the Cold War was over Even Soviet allies in Eastern Europe were 
only semisovereign when one of them deviated from the set sphere of 
action a Soviet intervention usually followed to put it back on track This 
was the case in the German Democratic Republic in 1953 Hungary in 1956 
and Czechoslovakia in 1968 Even after 1991 in postSoviet Russia we can 
find elements of imperialist thought embodied in the interventions in what 
is considered to be a Russian sphere of influence such as Moldova 1992 
Georgia 2008 or Ukraine 2014

the argument that CentralEastern Europe did not possess any colonies 
and should therefore not be punished shamed or forced to apologise for

Theories and Practices of Colonial Government
During the 1930s a dispute emerged between British and French colonial 
policymakers about the putative superiority of their respective models of 
colonial administration On the British side the model of Indirect Rule 
theorised by the British colonial administrator Lord Frederick Lugard 1858
1945 in The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa 1922 was characterised 
by recognition of native authorities and respect for local customs under this 
system British administrators would simply supervise indigenous chiefs and 
educate them in the art of good government In contrast the French colonial 
doctrine was seen as assimilationist and centralising 
A purely direct rule was in fact impossible partly because the empires did 
not have the means to deploy a large administrative staff in their colonies and 
partly because they would not have had the legitimacy to administer hostile 
populations In fact colonial domination could not have been possible without
