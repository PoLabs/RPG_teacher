sausages from the poker Dudley fidgeted a little Uncle Vernon said
sharply Dont touch anything he gives you Dudley
The giant chuckled darkly
Yet great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore Dursley don
worry
He passed the sausages to Harry who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful but he still couldnt take his eyes off the
giant Finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said
Im sorry but I still dont really know who you are
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his
hand
Call me Hagrid he said everyone does An like I told yeh Im
Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts  yehll know all about Hogwarts o course
Er  no said Harry
Hagrid looked shocked
Sorry Harry said quickly
Sony barked Hagrid turning to stare at the Dursleys who shrank back
into the shadows It s them as should be sorry I knew yeh werent
gettin yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldnt even know abou
Hogwarts fer cryin out loud Did yeh never wonder where yet parents
learned it all
All what asked Harry
ALL WHAT Hagrid thundered Now wait jus one second
He had leapt to his feet In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut
The Dursleys were cowering against the wall
Do you mean ter tell me he growled at the Dursleys that this boy 
this boy  knows nothin abou  about ANYTHING
Harry thought this was going a bit far He had been to school after
all and his marks werent bad
