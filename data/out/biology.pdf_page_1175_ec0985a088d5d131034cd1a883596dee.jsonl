Anterior Pituitary
The anterior pituitary gland or adenohypophysis is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the
hypothalamus down along the infundibulum and to the anterior pituitary This capillary network is a part of
the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and
hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system A portal system carries blood from one capillary
network to another therefore the hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus
to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the circulatory system
The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones growth hormone GH prolactin PRL thyroidstimulating
hormone TSH melaninstimulating hormone MSH adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH folliclestimulating
hormone FSH and luteinizing hormone LH Anterior pituitary hormones are sometimes referred to as tropic
hormones because they control the functioning of other organs While these hormones are produced by the
anterior pituitary their production is controlled by regulatory hormones produced by the hypothalamus These
regulatory hormones can be releasing hormones or inhibiting hormones causing more or less of the anterior
pituitary hormones to be secreted These travel from the hypothalamus through the hypophyseal portal system
to the anterior pituitary where they exert their effect Negative feedback then regulates how much of these
regulatory hormones are released and how much anterior pituitary hormone is secreted
Posterior Pituitary
The posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary It is a part of the brain
extending down from the hypothalamus and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells which support
axons that extend from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary The posterior pituitary and the infundibulum
together are referred to as the neurohypophysis
The hormones antidiuretic hormone ADH also known as vasopressin and oxytocin are produced by neurons
in the hypothalamus and transported within these axons along the infundibulum to the posterior pituitary They
are released into the circulatory system via neural signaling from the hypothalamus These hormones are
considered to be posterior pituitary hormones even though they are produced by the hypothalamus because
that is where they are released into the circulatory system The posterior pituitary itself does not produce
hormones but instead stores hormones produced by the hypothalamus and releases them into the bloodstream
Thyroid Gland
The thyroid gland is located in the neck just below the larynx and in front of the trachea as shown in Figure
3716 It is a butterflyshaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus It has a dark red color
due to its extensive vascular system When the thyroid swells due to dysfunction it can be felt under the skin of
the neck
