lost its longcultivated meaning as an identityreproducing frontier against the 
major national enemy 
In the Czech national imagination the border has long carried a strong 
national meaning as the frontier dividing us from the national enemy 
augmented by a larger civilisational meaning of the frontier between Slavic 
and Germanic worlds The no less fundamental boundary between the 
socialist and the capitalist system concurrent with the Iron Curtain and the 
line dividing aggressive imperialists and the peaceseeking socialist camp 
enhanced the existing template with new meaning No wonder then that the 
border was a strong theme of artistic representations ranging from poetry to 
novels and short stories Czechoslovak film production followed suit with Krl 
umavy King of the Bohemian Forest 1959 a film about border guards hunting 
a human trafficker representing an apex of the genre Dozens of films ranging 
from simple propaganda to more critical dramas employed themes from 
crime and espionage to stage psychological inquiries into the formative nature 
of the border for its guards or for those who came to build a new society in the 
rough conditions of borderlands Film experts and historians have decoded the 
borderland in fiction as a social laboratory in which new socialist characters 
were formed a sort of eastern Wild West in which the border played a role 
similar to that of the western frontier of American civilisationand it was the 
border guards who played the heroes of this socialist Western or Eastern 
genre
The border played a role in narratives that reproduced largescale 
collective identities as well as in propaganda that legitimised the new spatial 
and ideological order with its radical closure of borders after 1948 But the 
border also had an identityforming role in its own right In the first half of 
the twentieth century the border region of Chodsko and the predominantly 
Czech towns in the southwest part of the borderland such as Kdyn used the 
regions strategic position as a bulwark against outsiders not only to reaffirm 
their specific regional and local identities but also to claim special assets 
such as district status In the new conditions of socialist Czechoslovakia small 
towns also capitalised on their proximity to the dividing line between two 
divergent socioeconomic systemsalbeit mostly symbolically through self
promotion For instance a 1979 book celebrating the 700year anniversary 
of Nov Hrady a town located close to the Austrian border claimed that its 
jubilee had broader political implications as it highlighted the importance 
of building and guarding socialism at the very frontiers of the Soviet bloc 
At the same time however the radical change of population in much of the 
borderland led to a lack of local attachment to or sense of place in the region 
a problem that continues to affect parts of it today
