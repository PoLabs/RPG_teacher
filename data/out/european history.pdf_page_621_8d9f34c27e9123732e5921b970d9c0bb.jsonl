52 DISTRIBUTING WEALTH

precedence Population growth and inflation in the sixteenth century led 
many landowners to attempt a revision of customary rents in their favour as 
well as a limitation of the extent of access to common resources which could 
be monetised such as firewood Opposition to such actions did not necessarily 
entail demands for social levelling criticism of rentracking landlords was 
often coupled with a nostalgia for the generosity and hospitality of their 
forbearers although to describe this as simply conservatism misses the degree 
to which village people could evoke a sense of communal living independent 
of and perhaps excluding the rich and powerful This social vision was not 
entirely incompatible with the perspective of rulers however and the mid
Tudor state was often sympathetic to those resisting enclosure for instance 
which was seen as avaricious and in conflict with prevailing religious ideals 
Opposition to enclosure often happened through the law But the attitude of 
legislators was also coloured by an awareness that depopulating enclosures 
fed into social conflict and sometimes largescale revolts such as Ketts 
Rebellion in Norfolk in 1549 Even those revolts ostensibly driven by resistance 
to Protestantism such as the Western Rebellion also 1549 were in part about 
the distribution of wealth as the Reformation had entailed the confiscation of 
church resources which were often seen as the property of the local community 
which had invested in church buildings and ornamentation over generations
However the year 1549 was a watershed in the tradition of popular rebellion 
in England Increasingly the more prosperous beneficiaries of greater freedom 
of movement and more generous leases in the rural economy came to identify 
their interests less with their poorer neighbours and more with the state which 
by the late sixteenth century had committed to a programme of social discipline 
of the poor For village elites controlling access to common resources became 
a priority the right to gleanto collect leftover grain from the harvestmight 
be limited to the deserving poor at the expense of vagrant outsiders The 
impetus to enclose common fields might also come from below rather than 
from the landowners Custom of course can be a socially restrictive ideal 
and in the divided village communities of the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries the landless poor increasingly felt the brunt of this Although they 
obdurately clung to their remaining rights to collective resources because 
their ability to do this often rested on their ability to assert their status as the 
honest poor the landless poors actions arguably endorsed and shored up 
rather than challenged the increasingly unequal distribution of wealth in rural 
communities Social protest might then be reduced to seditious talk targeted 
against the authorities and the rich but limited in its ability to transform 
society Action in defence of the moral economy that had once informed price 
controls could still encompass a broader range of local society however
