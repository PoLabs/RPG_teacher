by science defined who was termed an insider and who was an outsider to 
the national body In practice this meant the exclusion of various minorities 
from newly established societies This was most notably the case for Jews who 
had long been residents of various parts of Europe in some cases Poland for 
over a millennium 
President Wilson and his followers did not overlook the implications of 
the gospel of national selfdetermination for those ethnic minorities that 
were not able to secure their own states To protect these minorities the Paris 
Peace Treaties of 19191920 included several international agreements on 
minority rights and the newly established supranational League of Nations

to the human rights regime also meant the end of protection for groups that 
defined themselves beyond the strict confines of the nationstate 
The nationstate itself lost none of its significance after 1945 On the contrary 
it remained the norm in international politics which now also included the 
decolonising world The 1948 Declaration implied the existence of nation
states as the precondition for the fulfilment of the rights it enumerated In 
doing so with the consent of the big powers the declaration was contributing 
to the destruction of colonial empires accelerated in the 1950s by the growing 
mobilisation of colonial subjects At the same time multiethnicity partially
