Figure 421 A macrophage has engulfed phagocytized a potentially pathogenic bacterium and then fuses with
lysosomes within the cell to destroy the pathogen Other organelles are present in the cell but for simplicity we do not
show them
45  The Cytoskeleton
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the cytoskeleton

Compare the roles of microfilaments intermediate filaments and microtubules

Compare and contrast cilia and flagella

Summarize the differences among the components of prokaryotic cells animal cells and plant cells
If you were to remove all the organelles from a cell would the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm be
the only components left No Within the cytoplasm there would still be ions and organic molecules plus
a network of protein fibers that help maintain the cells shape secure some organelles in specific positions
allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move
Collectively scientists call this network of protein fibers the cytoskeleton There are three types of fibers within
the cytoskeleton microfilaments intermediate filaments and microtubules Figure 422 Here we will examine
each
