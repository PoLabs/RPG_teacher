The RedHeaded League
mine He said a few words to each candidate as he
came up and then he always managed to nd some
fault in them which would disqualify them Getting a
vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter
after all However when our turn came the little man
was much more favourable to me than to any of the
others and he closed the door as we entered so that
he might have a private word with us
 This is Mr Jabez Wilson said my assistant and
he is willing to ll a vacancy in the League
 And he is admirably suited for it the other an
swered He has every requirement I cannot recall
when I have seen anything so ne He took a step
backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at
my hair until I felt quite bashful Then suddenly he
plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated
me warmly on my success
 It would be injustice to hesitate said he You
will however I am sure excuse me for taking an obvi
ous precaution With that he seized my hair in both
his hands and tugged until I yelled with the pain
There is water in your eyes said he as he released
me I perceive that all is as it should be But we have
to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs
and once by paint I could tell you tales of cobblers
wax which would disgust you with human nature
He stepped over to the window and shouted through
it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was lled
A groan of disappointment came up from below and
the folk all trooped away in different directions until
there was not a redhead to be seen except my own
and that of the manager
 My name said he is Mr Duncan Ross and I
am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left
by our noble benefactor Are you a married man Mr
Wilson Have you a family
I answered that I had not
His face fell immediately
 Dear me he said gravely that is very serious
indeed I am sorry to hear you say that The fund
was of course for the propagation and spread of the
redheads as well as for their maintenance It is ex
ceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor
My face lengthened at this Mr Holmes for I
thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all
but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said
that it would be all right
 In the case of another said he the objection
might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour
of a man with such a head of hair as yours When
shall you be able to enter upon your new duties
 Well it is a little awkward for I have a business
already said I
 Oh never mind about that Mr Wilson said
Vincent Spaulding I should be able to look after that
for you
 What would be the hours I asked
 Ten to two
Now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of
an evening Mr Holmes especially Thursday and Fri
day evening which is just before payday so it would
suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings Be
sides I knew that my assistant was a good man and
that he would see to anything that turned up
 That would suit me very well said I And the
pay
 Is 4 a week
 And the work
 Is purely nominal
 What do you call purely nominal
 Well you have to be in the ofce or at least
in the building the whole time If you leave you
forfeit your whole position forever The will is very
clear upon that point You dont comply with the
conditions if you budge from the ofce during that
time
 Its only four hours a day and I should not think
of leaving said I
 No excuse will avail said Mr Duncan Ross nei
ther sickness nor business nor anything else There
you must stay or you lose your billet
 And the work
 Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
There is the rst volume of it in that press You must
nd your own ink pens and blottingpaper but we
provide this table and chair Will you be ready to
morrow
 Certainly I answered
 Then goodbye Mr Jabez Wilson and let me
congratulate you once more on the important position
which you have been fortunate enough to gain He
bowed me out of the room and I went home with my
assistant hardly knowing what to say or do I was so
pleased at my own good fortune
Well I thought over the matter all day and by
evening I was in low spirits again for I had quite
persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some
great hoax or fraud though what its object might be
I could not imagine It seemed altogether past be
lief that anyone could make such a will or that they
