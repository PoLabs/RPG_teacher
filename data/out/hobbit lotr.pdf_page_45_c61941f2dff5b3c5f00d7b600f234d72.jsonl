Here it is at last he called and the others gathered round him and looked
over the edge They saw a valley far below They could hear the voice of
hurrying water in a rocky bed at the bottom the scent of trees was in the air and
there was a light on the valleyside across the water
Bilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk down the
steep zigzag path into the secret valley of Rivendell The air grew warmer as
they got lower and the smell of the pinetrees made him drowsy so that every
now and again he nodded and nearly fell off or bumped his nose on the ponys
neck Their spirits rose as they went down and down The trees changed to beech
and oak and there was a comfortable feeling in the twilight The last green had
almost faded out of the grass when they came at length to an open glade not far
above the banks of the stream
Hmmm it smells like elves thought Bilbo and he looked up at the stars
They were burning bright and blue Just then there came a burst of song like
laughter in the trees
O What are you doing
And where are you going
Your ponies need shoeing
The river is flowing
    O tralalalally
        here down in the valley
O What are you seeking
And where are you making
The faggots are reeking
The bannocks are baking
    O trillillillolly
        the valley is jolly
            ha ha
O Where are you going
With beards all awagging
No knowing no knowing
What brings Mister Baggins
