271  Features of the Animal Kingdom
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

List the features that distinguish the kingdom Animalia from other kingdoms

Explain the processes of animal reproduction and embryonic development

Describe the roles that Hox genes play in development
Two different groups within the Domain Eukaryota have produced complex multicellular organisms The plants
arose within the Archaeplastida whereas the animals and their close relatives the fungi arose within the
Opisthokonta However plants and animals not only have different life styles they also have different cellular
histories as eukaryotes The opisthokonts share the possession of a single posterior flagellum in flagellated cells
eg sperm cells
Most animals also share other features that distinguish them from organisms in other kingdoms All animals
require a source of food and are therefore heterotrophic ingesting other living or dead organisms This feature
distinguishes them from autotrophic organisms such as most plants which synthesize their own nutrients
through photosynthesis As heterotrophs animals may be carnivores herbivores omnivores or parasites
Figure 272ab As with plants almost all animals have a complex tissue structure with differentiated and
specialized tissues The necessity to collect food has made most animals motile at least during certain life
stages The typical life cycle in animals is diplontic like you the diploid state is multicellular whereas the haploid
state is gametic such as sperm or egg We should note that the alternation of generations characteristic of
the land plants is typically not found in animals In animals whose life histories include several to multiple body
forms eg insect larvae or the medusae of some Cnidarians all body forms are diploid Animal embryos pass
through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined and fixed body plan The body plan refers
to the morphology of an animal determined by developmental cues
Figure 272 Heterotrophy All animals are heterotrophs and thus derive energy from a variety of food sources The
a black bear is an omnivore eating both plants and animals The b heartworm Dirofilaria immitis is a parasite that
derives energy from its hosts It spends its larval stage in mosquitoes and its adult stage infesting the heart of dogs

Complex Tissue Structure
Many of the specialized tissues of animals are associated with the requirements and hazards of seeking
and processing food This explains why animals typically have evolved special structures associated with
specific methods of food capture and complex digestive systems supported by accessory organs Sensory
structures help animals navigate their environment detect food sources and avoid becoming a food source
for other animals Movement is driven by muscle tissue attached to supportive structures like bone or chitin
and is coordinated by neural communication Animal cells may also have unique structures for intercellular
communication such as gap junctions The evolution of nerve tissues and muscle tissues has resulted in
animals unique ability to rapidly sense and respond to changes in their environment This allows animals to
survive in environments where they must compete with other species to meet their nutritional demands
