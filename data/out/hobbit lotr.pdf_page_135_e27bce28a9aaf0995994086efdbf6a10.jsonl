the woods from which they could escape at times to hunt or to ride and run over
the open lands by moonlight or starlight and after the coming of Men they took
ever more and more to the gloaming and the dusk Still elves they were and
remain and that is Good People
In a great cave some miles within the edge of Mirkwood on its eastern side
there lived at this time their greatest king Before his huge doors of stone a river
ran out of the heights of the forest and flowed on and out into the marshes at the
feet of the high wooded lands This great cave from which countless smaller
ones opened out on every side wound far underground and had many passages
and wide halls but it was lighter and more wholesome than any goblindwelling
and neither so deep nor so dangerous In fact the subjects of the king mostly
lived and hunted in the open woods and had houses or huts on the ground and in
the branches The beeches were their favourite trees The kings cave was his
palace and the strong place of his treasure and the fortress of his people against
their enemies
It was also the dungeon of his prisoners So to the cave they dragged Thorin
not too gently for they did not love dwarves and thought he was an enemy In
ancient days they had had wars with some of the dwarves whom they accused of
stealing their treasure It is only fair to say that the dwarves gave a different
account and said that they only took what was their due for the elfking had
bargained with them to shape his raw gold and silver and had afterwards refused
to give them their pay If the elfking had a weakness it was for treasure
especially for silver and white gems and though his hoard was rich he was ever
eager for more since he had not yet as great a treasure as other elflords of old
His people neither mined nor worked metals or jewels nor did they bother much
with trade or with tilling the earth All this was well known to every dwarf
though Thorins family had had nothing to do with the old quarrel I have spoken
of Consequently Thorin was angry at their treatment of him when they took
their spell off him and he came to his senses and also he was determined that no
word of gold or jewels should be dragged out of him
The king looked sternly on Thorin when he was brought before him and
asked him many questions But Thorin would only say that he was starving
Why did you and your folk three times try to attack my people at their
merrymaking asked the king
We did not attack them answered Thorin we came to beg because we
were starving
Where are your friends now and what are they doing
