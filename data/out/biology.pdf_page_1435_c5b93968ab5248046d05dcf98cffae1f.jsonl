Figure 4513 a Elephants are considered Kselected species as they live long mature late and provide longterm
parental care to few offspring Oak trees produce many offspring that do not receive parental care but are considered
Kselected species based on longevity and late maturation b Dandelions and jellyfish are both considered rselected
species as they mature early have short lifespans and produce many offspring that receive no parental care
Modern Theories of Life History
By the second half of the twentieth century the concept of K and rselected species was used extensively and
successfully to study populations The r and Kselection theory although accepted for decades and used for
much groundbreaking research has now been reconsidered and many population biologists have abandoned
or modified it Over the years several studies attempted to confirm the theory but these attempts have largely
failed Many species were identified that did not follow the theorys predictions Furthermore the theory ignored
the agespecific mortality of the populations which scientists now know is very important New demographic
based models of life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many ecological concepts
included in r and Kselection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors
455  Human Population Growth
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss exponential human population growth

Explain how humans have expanded the carrying capacity of their habitat

Relate population growth and age structure to the level of economic development in different countries

Discuss the longterm implications of unchecked human population growth
Population dynamics can be applied to human population growth Earths human population is growing rapidly
to the extent that some worry about the ability of the earths environment to sustain this population Longterm
exponential growth carries the potential risks of famine disease and largescale death
Although humans have increased the carrying capacity of their environment the technologies used to achieve
this transformation have caused unprecedented changes to Earths environment altering ecosystems to the
