Figure 424 Interferons are cytokines that are released by a cell infected with a virus Response of neighboring cells
to interferon helps stem the infection
Phagocytosis and Inflammation
The first cytokines to be produced are proinflammatory that is they encourage inflammation the localized
redness swelling heat and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly
permeable capillaries to a site of infection The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends
on the nature of the infecting pathogen Both macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular
debris through phagocytosis A neutrophil is also a phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens
Neutrophils shown in Figure 423 are the most abundant leukocytes of the immune system Neutrophils have
a nucleus with two to five lobes and they contain organelles called lysosomes that digest engulfed pathogens
An eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite it is involved in the allergic
response and in protection against helminthes parasitic worms
Neutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens such as bacteria
and fungi A mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules such as histamine in response
to large pathogens A basophil is a leukocyte that like a neutrophil releases chemicals to stimulate the
inflammatory response as illustrated in Figure 425 Basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity
responses and induce specific types of inflammatory responses Eosinophils and basophils produce additional
inflammatory mediators to recruit more leukocytes A hypersensitive immune response to harmless antigens
such as in pollen often involves the release of histamine by basophils and mast cells
