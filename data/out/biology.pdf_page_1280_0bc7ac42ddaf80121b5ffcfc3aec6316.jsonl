Vertebrate Diversity in Blood Circulation
Blood circulation has evolved differently in vertebrates and may show variation in different animals for the
required amount of pressure organ and vessel location and organ size Animals with longs necks and those
that live in cold environments have distinct blood pressure adaptations
Long necked animals such as giraffes need to pump blood upward from the heart against gravity The
blood pressure required from the pumping of the left ventricle would be equivalent to 250 mm Hg mm Hg
 millimeters of mercury a unit of pressure to reach the height of a giraffes head which is 25 meters
higher than the heart However if checks and balances were not in place this blood pressure would damage
the giraffes brain particularly if it was bending down to drink These checks and balances include valves
and feedback mechanisms that reduce the rate of cardiac output Longnecked dinosaurs such as the
sauropods had to pump blood even higher up to ten meters above the heart This would have required
a blood pressure of more than 600 mm Hg which could only have been achieved by an enormous heart
Evidence for such an enormous heart does not exist and mechanisms to reduce the blood pressure required
include the slowing of metabolism as these animals grew larger It is likely that they did not routinely feed
on tree tops but grazed on the ground
Living in cold water whales need to maintain the temperature in their blood This is achieved by the
veins and arteries being close together so that heat exchange can occur This mechanism is called a
countercurrent heat exchanger The blood vessels and the whole body are also protected by thick layers
of blubber to prevent heat loss In land animals that live in cold environments thick fur and hibernation are
used to retain heat and slow metabolism
Blood Pressure
The pressure of the blood flow in the body is produced by the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid blood against
the walls of the blood vessels Fluid will move from areas of high to low hydrostatic pressures In the arteries
the hydrostatic pressure near the heart is very high and blood flows to the arterioles where the rate of flow is
slowed by the narrow openings of the arterioles During systole when new blood is entering the arteries the
artery walls stretch to accommodate the increase of pressure of the extra blood during diastole the walls return
to normal because of their elastic properties The blood pressure of the systole phase and the diastole phase
graphed in Figure 4019 gives the two pressure readings for blood pressure For example 12080 indicates a
reading of 120 mm Hg during the systole and 80 mm Hg during diastole Throughout the cardiac cycle the blood
continues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate This resistance to blood flow is called peripheral
resistance
