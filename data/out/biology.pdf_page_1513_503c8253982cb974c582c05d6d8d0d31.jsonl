Crop success is largely dependent on the quality of the soil Although some agricultural soils are rendered
sterile using controversial cultivation and chemical treatments most contain a huge diversity of organisms that
maintain nutrient cyclesbreaking down organic matter into nutrient compounds that crops need for growth
These organisms also maintain soil texture that affects water and oxygen dynamics in the soil that are necessary
for plant growth If farmers had to maintain arable soil using alternate means the cost of food would be much
higher than it is now These kinds of processes are called ecosystem services They occur within ecosystems
such as soil ecosystems as a result of the diverse metabolic activities of the organisms living there but they
provide benefits to human food production drinking water availability and breathable air
Plant pollination is another key ecosystem service provided by various species of bees other insects and birds
One estimate indicates that honey bee pollination provides the United States a 16 billion annual benefit
Honey bee populations in North America have been suffering large losses caused by a syndrome known as
colony collapse disorder whose cause is unclear Evidence suggests the possible culprits may be the invasive
varroa mite coupled with the Nosema gut parasite and acute paralysis virus Loss of these species would render
it very difficult if not impossible to grow any of the 150 United States crops requiring pollination including
grapes oranges lemons peppers most brassica broccoli and cauliflower and many berries melons and
nuts
Finally humans compete for their food with crop pests most of which are insects Pesticides control these
competitors however pesticides are costly and lose their effectiveness over time as pest populations adapt and
evolve They also lead to collateral damage by killing nonpest species and risking the health of consumers and
agricultural workers Ecologists believe that the bulk of the work in removing pests is actually done by predators
and parasites of those pests but the impact has not been well studied A review found that in 74 percent of
studies that looked for an effect of landscape complexity on natural enemies of pests the greater the complexity
the greater the effect of pestsuppressing organisms An experimental study found that introducing multiple
enemies of pea aphids an important alfalfa pest increased the yield of alfalfa significantly This study shows the
importance of landscape diversity via the question of whether a diversity of pests is more effective at control than
one single pest the results showed this to be the case Loss of diversity in pest enemies will inevitably make it
more difficult and costly to grow food
Wild Food Sources
In addition to growing crops and raising animals for food humans obtain food resources from wild populations
primarily fish populations In fact for approximately 1 billion people worldwide aquatic resources provide the
main source of animal protein But since 1990 global fish production has declined sometimes dramatically
Unfortunately and despite considerable effort few fisheries on the planet are managed for sustainability
Fishery extinctions rarely lead to complete extinction of the harvested species but rather to a radical
restructuring of the marine ecosystem in which a dominant species is so overharvested that it becomes a minor
player ecologically In addition to humans losing the food source these alterations affect many other species in
ways that are difficult or impossible to predict The collapse of fisheries has dramatic and longlasting effects on
local populations that work in the fishery In addition the loss of an inexpensive protein source to populations
that cannot afford to replace it will increase the cost of living and limit societies in other ways In general the
fish taken from fisheries have shifted to smaller species as larger species are fished to extinction The ultimate
outcome could clearly be the loss of aquatic systems as food sources

Psychological and Moral Value
Finally it has been clearly shown that humans benefit psychologically from living in a biodiverse world A chief
proponent of this idea is Harvard entomologist E O Wilson He argues that human evolutionary history has
adapted us to live in a natural environment and that city environments generate psychological stressors that
affect human health and wellbeing There is considerable research into the psychological regenerative benefits
