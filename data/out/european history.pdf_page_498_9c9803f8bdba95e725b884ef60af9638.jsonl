the declining impact of kinship networks Industrialisation and urbanisation 
across much of Europe during the long nineteenth century meant a shift 
towards wage earners and male family breadwinners As a result individual 
nuclear families would need to fend more for themselves and sometimes 
turn to charity or the state for example through poor laws or the new field 
of social work to seek help Assistance for the poor was itself experiencing 
vast transformation during this periodfor example in the reinvention of 
the English Poor Law in 1834 to be a more restrictive system Other examples 
of these transformations in assistance for the poor included the creation of 
social insurance systems linked to paid employment Such systems favoured 
the model of the breadwinner family by rewarding wage earners and by 
extension their families with protections in case they were injured at work 
came into ill health or retired
Meanwhile feminist groups like the German League for the Protection 
of Mothers 1904 sought to break down old patriarchal systems that gave 
husbands and fathers ultimate authority in the household They aimed 
instead to augment womens rights as mothers and wives Concerns about the 
protection of women as mothers led to innovative new policies on maternity 
leave includingfor examplethe Swiss Factory Act of 1877 and additional 
legislation in Germany in 1878 and 1883 and France in 1909 The movement 
to protect women wives and mothers often intersected both in terms of its 
arguments and in terms of its members with campaigns to protect children A 
number of countries across Europe introduced new legislation in the middle 
of the nineteenth century to reduce labour hours and increase schooling for 
children or to ban them outright from employment in certain industries 
Policies on the protection of children and infants connected in the latter 
part of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century with 
anxieties about declining birth rates as well as high infant mortality rates For 
example during the 1840s in France England and Sweden nearly 150 out of 
every 1000 babies died in their first year of life Poor sanitary conditions in 
urban areas contributed to this problem as did illness and poor nutrition As 
a consequence a number of innovative municipalities around the continent 
developed milk dispensary schemes and education in breastfeeding in order 
to help provide sanitary milk to babies 
Moreover across many European countries birth rates were also slowing 
This seemed a particularly pressing problem both in light of worryingly 
high infant mortality rates and in the wake of war which led to fears that 
families were failing to produce enough children to provide for future armies 
that could defend their homelands For example the FrancoPrussian War of 
18701871 sparked a pronatalist movement in France that sought to increase 
the countrys diminishing birth rate These fears resonated elsewhere as well
