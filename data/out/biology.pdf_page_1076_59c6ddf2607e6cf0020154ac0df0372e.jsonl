351  Neurons and Glial Cells
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

List and describe the functions of the structural components of a neuron

List and describe the four main types of neurons

Compare the functions of different types of glial cells
Nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom vary in structure and complexity as illustrated by the variety
of animals shown in Figure 352 Some organisms like sea sponges lack a true nervous system Others like
jellyfish lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells neurons called
a nerve net Echinoderms such as sea stars have nerve cells that are bundled into fibers called nerves
Flatworms of the phylum Platyhelminthes have both a central nervous system CNS made up of a small
brain and two nerve cords and a peripheral nervous system PNS containing a system of nerves that extend
throughout the body The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly decentralized It contains a
brain ventral nerve cord and ganglia clusters of connected neurons These ganglia can control movements
and behaviors without input from the brain Octopi may have the most complicated of invertebrate nervous
systemsthey have neurons that are organized in specialized lobes and eyes that are structurally similar to
vertebrate species
