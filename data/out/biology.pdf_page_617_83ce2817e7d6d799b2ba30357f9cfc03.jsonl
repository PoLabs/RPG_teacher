Prokaryotes and the Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen is a very important element for life because it is a major constituent of proteins and nucleic acids
It is a macronutrient and in nature it is recycled from organic compounds to ammonia ammonium ions
nitrate nitrite and nitrogen gas by many processes many of which are carried out only by prokaryotes As
illustrated in Figure 2219 prokaryotes are key to the nitrogen cycle The largest pool of nitrogen available in
the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen N2 from the air but this nitrogen is not usable by plants which
are primary producers Gaseous nitrogen is transformed or fixed into more readily available forms such as
ammonia NH3 through the process of nitrogen fixation Nitrogenfixing bacteria include Azotobacter in soil
and the ubiquitous photosynthetic cyanobacteria Some nitrogen fixing bacteria like Rhizobium live in symbiotic
relationships in the roots of legumes Another source of ammonia is ammonification the process by which
ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogencontaining organic compounds The ammonium ion
is progressively oxidized by different species of bacteria in a process called nitrification The nitrification process
begins with the conversion of ammonium to nitrite NO2 and continues with the conversion of nitrite to nitrate
Nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera Nitrosomas Nitrobacter and Nitrospira
Most nitrogen in soil is in the form of ammonium NH4 or nitrate NO3 Ammonia and nitrate can be used by
plants or converted to other forms
Ammonia released into the atmosphere however represents only 15 percent of the total nitrogen released the
rest is as N2 and N2O nitrous oxide Ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes yielding N2
as the final product Denitrifying bacteria reverse the process of nitrification reducing the nitrate from soils to
gaseous compounds such as N2O NO and N2
