dusk There will be a bit of moon if it keeps fine and that is lucky Not that they
mind the moon much but it will give us a little light to steer by
O yes he said in answer to more questions from the hobbit You lose
track of time inside goblintunnels Todays Thursday and it was Monday night
or Tuesday morning that we were captured We have gone miles and miles and
