capture more sunlight with their increased surface area by employing more chloroplasts to trap light energy and
convert it to chemical energy which is then used to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates The
carbohydrates are exported to the rest of the plant by the conductive cells of phloem tissue
The existence of two types of leaf morphologymicrophylls and megaphyllssuggests that leaves evolved
independently in several groups of plants Microphylls little leaves are small and have a simple vascular
system The first microphylls in the fossil record can be dated to 350 million years ago in the late Silurian A
single unbranched veina bundle of vascular tissue made of xylem and phloemruns through the center of
the leaf Microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches or from sporangia that lost their
reproductive capabilities Microphylls are seen in club mosses Microphylls probably preceded the development
of megaphylls big leaves which are larger leaves with a pattern of multiple veins Megaphylls most likely
appeared independently several times during the course of evolution Their complex networks of veins suggest
that several branches may have combined into a flattened organ with the gaps between the branches being
filled with photosynthetic tissue Megaphylls are seen in ferns and more derived vascular plants
In addition to photosynthesis leaves play another role in the life of the plants Pine cones mature fronds of
ferns and flowers are all sporophyllsleaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia Strobili are
conelike structures that contain sporangia They are prominent in conifers where they are commonly known as
pine cones
Ferns and Other Seedless Vascular Plants
By the late Devonian period plants had evolved vascular tissue welldefined leaves and root systems With
these advantages plants increased in height and size During the Carboniferous period 360 to 300 MYA
swamp forests of club mosses and horsetailssome specimens reaching heights of more than 30 m 100
ftcovered most of the land These forests gave rise to the extensive coal deposits that gave the Carboniferous
its name In seedless vascular plants the sporophyte became the dominant phase of the life cycle
Water is still required as a medium of sperm transport during the fertilization of seedless vascular plants and
most favor a moist environment Modernday seedless tracheophytes include club mosses horsetails ferns and
whisk ferns
Phylum Lycopodiophyta Club Mosses
The club mosses or phylum Lycopodiophyta are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants They
dominated the landscape of the Carboniferous growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests
Todays club mosses are diminutive evergreen plants consisting of a stem which may be branched and
microphylls Figure 2517 The phylum Lycopodiophyta consists of close to 1200 species including the
quillworts Isoetales the club mosses Lycopodiales and spike mosses Selaginellales none of which are true
mosses or bryophytes
Lycophytes follow the pattern of alternation of generations seen in the bryophytes except that the sporophyte
is the major stage of the life cycle Some lycophytes like the club moss Lycopodium produce gametophytes
that are independent of the sporophyte developing underground or in other locations where they can form
mycorrhizal associations with fungi In many club mosses the sporophyte gives rise to sporophylls arranged in
strobili conelike structures that give the class its name Sporangia develop within the chamber formed by each
sporophyll
Lycophytes can be homosporous spores of the same size or heterosporous spores of different sizes The
spike moss Selaginella is a heterosporous lycophyte The same strobilus will contain microsporangia which
produce spores that will develop into the male gametophyte and megasporangia which produce spores that will
develop into the female gametophyte Both gametophytes develop within the protective strobilus
