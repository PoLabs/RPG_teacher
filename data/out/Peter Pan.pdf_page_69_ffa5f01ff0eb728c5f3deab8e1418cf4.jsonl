The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression
and most of them began to look rather doubtful After all their faces
said were they not noodles to want to go
Now then cried Peter no fuss no blubbering goodbye
Wendy and he held out his hand cheerily quite as if they must
really go now for he had something important to do
She had to take his hand and there was no indication that he
would prefer a thimble
You will remember about changing your flannels Peter she
said lingering over him She was always so particular about their
flannels
Yes
And you will take your medicine
Yes
That seemed to be everything and an awkward pause followed
Peter however was not the kind that breaks down before other
people Are you ready Tinker Bell he called out
Ay ay
Then lead the way
Tink darted up the nearest tree but no one followed her for it was
at this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the
redskins Above where all had been so still the air was rent with
shrieks and the clash of steel Below there was dead silence Mouths
opened and remained open Wendy fell on her knees but her arms
were extended toward Peter All arms were extended to him as if
suddenly blown in his direction they were beseeching him mutely
not to desert them As for Peter he seized his sword the same he
thought he had slain Barbecue with and the lust of battle was in his
eye
