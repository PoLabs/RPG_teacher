Plants obtain food in two different ways Autotrophic plants can make their own food from inorganic raw
materials such as carbon dioxide and water through photosynthesis in the presence of sunlight Green plants
are included in this group Some plants however are heterotrophic they are totally parasitic and lacking in
chlorophyll These plants referred to as holoparasitic plants are unable to synthesize organic carbon and draw
all of their nutrients from the host plant
Plants may also enlist the help of microbial partners in nutrient acquisition Particular species of bacteria and
fungi have evolved along with certain plants to create a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with roots This
improves the nutrition of both the plant and the microbe The formation of nodules in legume plants and
mycorrhization can be considered among the nutritional adaptations of plants However these are not the only
type of adaptations that we may find many plants have other adaptations that allow them to thrive under specific
conditions

Nitrogen Fixation Root and Bacteria Interactions
Nitrogen is an important macronutrient because it is part of nucleic acids and proteins Atmospheric nitrogen
which is the diatomic molecule N2 or dinitrogen is the largest pool of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems
However plants cannot take advantage of this nitrogen because they do not have the necessary enzymes to
convert it into biologically useful forms However nitrogen can be fixed which means that it can be converted
to ammonia NH3 through biological physical or chemical processes As you have learned biological nitrogen
fixation BNF is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen N2 into ammonia NH3 exclusively carried out by
prokaryotes such as soil bacteria or cyanobacteria Biological processes contribute 65 percent of the nitrogen
used in agriculture The following equation represents the process
N2  16 ATP   8 e   8 H   2NH3    16 ADP   16 Pi   H2
The most important source of BNF is the symbiotic interaction between soil bacteria and legume plants including
many crops important to humans Figure 3110 The NH3 resulting from fixation can be transported into plant
tissue and incorporated into amino acids which are then made into plant proteins Some legume seeds such as
soybeans and peanuts contain high levels of protein and serve among the most important agricultural sources
of protein in the world
