colonialism in the case of the United Kingdom or rampant racism in the case 
of the United States The studentrun protest movements experimented with 
new ways of living and loving alongside new forms of provocative and 
performative protest including teachins sitins university occupations and 
impromptu political streetplays To varying degrees in different national 
contexts militancy was also discussed and employed This could range from 
throwing bags of flour or desserts at police and political representatives to 
erecting barricades and hurling stones and Molotov cocktails or even planting 
bombs Closely linked with this global upheaval was the birth of a plethora of 
interrelated political sub or countercultures such as the international Hippie 
movement the Italian Indiani Metropolitani the Dutch Provos or the German 
Spontis and Gammler These cultures experimented with new ways of living 
and relationships new styles and music and psychedelic drugs like LSD They 
tried to challenge the political and cultural status quo through creative and 
expressive forms of protest and placed a strong emphasis on selfactualisation 
authenticity and expression 
The political countercultures of the 1960s had a very complicated 
relationship with consumer culture On the one hand they were very critical 
towards it 1960s political countercultures often perceived mainstream societies 
as semiauthoritarian bourgeois and middleclass captured by a mindless 
consumerism that numbed the masses and supressed political dissent Some 
German activists who went on to become the founders of the leftwing terrorist 
Red Army Faction even firebombed two department stores in 1968 On the 
other hand these political countercultures built up their own alternative 
consumer culture with organic shops leftwing bookstores and alternative 
bars publishing houses or fashion brands Countercultural youths were 
often decidedly hedonistic in their leisure time and their general outlook on 
what it meant to be authentic Finally the political sub and countercultures 
of the 1960s relied on the same relationship with consumer industry as the 
nonpolitical youth cultures of the 1950s and early 1960s they used products 
made by consumer industries for example fashion and through a process of 
bricolage reassembled them in a specific style which to them conveyed a certain 
dissident political significance or identity These styles were then perceived 
as new trends and copied and disseminated further by consumer industries 
It was this process that moreover extended countercultural movements 
from the national level to the global level The availability of countercultural 
styles through a transnational consumer culture to some extent assisted in 
the dissemination and stylistic synchronisation of counter and subcultural 
movements in the 1960s
