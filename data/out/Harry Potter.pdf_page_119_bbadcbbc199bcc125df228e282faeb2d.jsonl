Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses
flashed furiously  how dare you  might have broken your neck 
It wasnt his fault Professor 
Be quiet Miss Patil
But Malfoy 
Thats enough Mr Weasley Potter follow me now
Harry caught sight of Malfoy Crabbe and Goyles triumphant faces as he
left walking numbly in Professor McGonagalls wake as she strode toward
the castle He was going to be expelled he just knew it He wanted to
say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong
with his voice Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even
looking at him he had to jog to keep up Now hed done it He hadnt
even lasted two weeks Hed be packing his bags in ten minutes What
would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep
Up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still Professor
McGonagall didnt say a word to him She wrenched open doors and marched
along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her Maybe she was
taking him to Dumbledore He thought of Hagrid expelled but allowed to
stay on as gamekeeper Perhaps he could be Hagrids assistant His
stomach twisted as he imagined it watching Ron and the others becoming
wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrids bag
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom She opened the door
and poked her head inside
Excuse me Professor Flitwick could I borrow Wood for a moment
Wood thought Harry bewildered was Wood a cane she was going to use on
him
But Wood turned out to be a person a burly fifthyear boy who came out
of Flitwicles class looking confused
Follow me you two said Professor McGonagall and they marched on up
the corridor Wood looking curiously at Harry
