physically identical
Once these validations were complete Mendel applied the pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma
of a plant with white flowers After gathering and sowing the seeds that resulted from this cross Mendel
found that 100 percent of the F1 hybrid generation had violet flowers Conventional wisdom at that time the
blending theory would have predicted the hybrid flowers to be pale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal
numbers of white and violet flowers In other words the contrasting parental traits were expected to blend in the
offspring Instead Mendels results demonstrated that the white flower trait in the F1 generation had completely
disappeared
Importantly Mendel did not stop his experimentation there He allowed the F1 plants to selffertilize and found
that of F2generation plants 705 had violet flowers and 224 had white flowers This was a ratio of 315 violet
flowers per one white flower or approximately 31 When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet
flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa he obtained about the same ratio regardless of
which parent male or female contributed which trait This is called a reciprocal crossa paired cross in which
the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in
the other cross For the other six characteristics Mendel examined the F1 and F2 generations behaved in the
same way as they had for flower color One of the two traits would disappear completely from the F1 generation
only to reappear in the F2 generation at a ratio of approximately 31 Table 121

Upon compiling his results for many thousands of plants Mendel concluded that the characteristics could be
divided into expressed and latent traits He called these respectively dominant and recessive traits Dominant
traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization Recessive traits become latent or disappear
in the offspring of a hybridization The recessive trait does however reappear in the progeny of the hybrid
offspring An example of a dominant trait is the violetflower trait For this same characteristic flower color
whitecolored flowers are a recessive trait The fact that the recessive trait reappeared in the F2 generation
meant that the traits remained separate not blended in the plants of the F1 generation Mendel also proposed
that plants possessed two copies of the trait for the flowercolor characteristic and that each parent transmitted
