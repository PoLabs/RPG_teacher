I say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the
front window Hagrid was standing there grinning at Harry and pointing
at two large ice creams to show he couldnt come in
Thats Hagrid said Harry pleased to know something the boy didnt
He works at Hogwarts
Oh said the boy Ive heard of him Hes a sort of servant isnt
he
Hes the gamekeeper said Harry He was liking the boy less and less
every second
Yes exactly I heard hes a sort of savage  lives in a hut on the
school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic
and ends up setting fire to his bed
I think hes brilliant said Harry coldly
Do you said the boy with a slight sneer Why is he with you Where
are your parents
Theyre dead said Harry shortly He didnt feel much like going into
the matter with this boy
Oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all But they were
our kind werent they
They were a witch and wizard if thats what you mean
I really dont think they should let the other sort in do you Theyre
just not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways Some
of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter
imagine I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families
Whats your surname anyway
But before Harry could answer Madam Malkin said Thats you done my
dear and Harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy
hopped down from the footstool
Well Ill see you at Hogwarts I suppose said the drawling boy
