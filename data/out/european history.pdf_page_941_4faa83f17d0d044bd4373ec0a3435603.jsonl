orgwikiFileHajek_Kronykajpg The frontpage of the Latin manuscript Kronyka esk 1541 which 
recounts the history of the Czech lands from ancient times to the first quarter of the twelfth century
Although Blejovsk wrote the history of and stories about Bohemia and the 
Czechs in the Czech language his main aim was to present the history of the 
Holy Communion in both formsie wine and bread The Holy Communion 
of Christs Body and Blood was considered the most significant belief element 
of the Czech Utraquist movement Historically he regarded it as older and 
truer than the communion in one kind with just bread representing the Body 
of Christ The work of Blejovsk railed against the Catholics who served Holy 
Communion in just one form but also against a variety of other Christian sects 
including the Unity of Brethren and partly against the Lutherans Hjeks 
work on the other hand was of a popular character and partly fabricated his 
main goal being to cultivate our Czech homeland He attempted to rally the 
Czech people against the perceived belittlement and insults of them by their 
neighbours and enemies Hjek was patriotic and antiGerman the religious 
issue by contrast was not so strong in his work
