other different species
result of a cross between two truebreeding parents that express different traits for only one
characteristic
parental generation in a cross
observable traits expressed by an organism
probability of two independent events occurring simultaneously can be calculated by multiplying
the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone
visual representation of a cross between two individuals in which the gametes of each
individual are denoted along the top and side of a grid respectively and the possible zygotic genotypes are
recombined at each box in the grid
trait that appears latent or nonexpressed when the individual also carries a dominant trait for that
same characteristic when present as two identical copies the recessive trait is expressed
inheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form the heterozygote
may be normal or have some altered nonlethal phenotype
paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the
respective traits of the female and male in the other cross
any gene on a sex chromosome
probability of the occurrence of at least one of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of their
individual probabilities
cross between a dominant expressing individual with an unknown genotype and a homozygous
recessive individual the offspring phenotypes indicate whether the unknown parent is heterozygous or
homozygous for the dominant trait
variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic
gene present on the X but not the Y chromosome
CHAPTER SUMMARY
121 Mendels Experiments and the Laws of Probability
Working with garden pea plants Mendel found that crosses between parents that differed by one trait produced
F1 offspring that all expressed the traits of one parent Observable traits are referred to as dominant and non
expressed traits are described as recessive When the offspring in Mendels experiment were selfcrossed the
F2 offspring exhibited the dominant trait or the recessive trait in a 31 ratio confirming that the recessive trait
had been transmitted faithfully from the original P0 parent Reciprocal crosses generated identical F1 and F2
offspring ratios By examining sample sizes Mendel showed that his crosses behaved reproducibly according
to the laws of probability and that the traits were inherited as independent events
Two rules in probability can be used to find the expected proportions of offspring of different traits from different
crosses To find the probability of two or more independent events occurring together apply the product rule
and multiply the probabilities of the individual events The use of the word and suggests the appropriate
application of the product rule To find the probability of two or more events occurring in combination apply the
sum rule and add their individual probabilities together The use of the word or suggests the appropriate
application of the sum rule
122 Characteristics and Traits
When truebreeding or homozygous individuals that differ for a certain trait are crossed all of the offspring will
be heterozygotes for that trait If the traits are inherited as dominant and recessive the F1 offspring will all
