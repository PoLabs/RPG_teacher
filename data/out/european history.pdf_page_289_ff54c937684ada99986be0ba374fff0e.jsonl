Representation and Citizenship
Modern democracy which entitles the majority of adult citizens the right 
to vote in national elections only emerged in Europe during the nineteenth 
century It would however be wrong to think of early modern citizens as 
mere subjects mercilessly at the whims of princes and their aristocracies 
It is true that several European countries limited the scope of parliamentary 
representation most famously in France where from 1614 the StatesGeneral 
was no longer summoned until that fateful summer of 1789 Parliaments like 
the StatesGeneral were usually meetings of representatives from corporate 
bodies such as the church the nobility and towns and cities England 
was one of the very few countries to have proper parliamentary elections 
where an estimated 510 percent of the adult male population was entitled 
to vote There the number of urban representatives increased steadily after 
the Reformation through the incorporation of an increasing number of 
urban settlements By the time of the Glorious Revolution 1689 more than 
half of parliamentary seats were in fact controlled by urban citizens even if 
their occupants were usually gentry or noblemen In the Iberian and Italian 
kingdoms of the Spanish monarchy the three social strata nobility clergy 
cities were represented in distinct parliaments Cortes Corts Parlamenti there 
was no central parliament At the centre of power in Castile progressively 
aristocratised urban elites would become the exclusive voice of the kingdom 
after 1538 when Charles V stopped inviting the high aristocrats Grandes and 
Ttulos de Castilla and the Catholic hierarchy to the meetings of the Castilian 
Cortesnot long after Castilian cities had risen up against the emperor during 
the war of the Comuneros 15201522 
As in Spain the participation of early modern European citizens was much 
more extensive in regional assemblies and local institutions And this made 
sense because most public services were delivered regionally and locally 
rather than nationally Very few early modern states offered more than token 
contributions in the realms of education health care and social support or 
even infrastructure justice and economic policy Overwhelmingly these lay 
within the remit of regional and local authorities a fact overlooked by much 
of the historical literature 
Urban privileges sometimes included the right to be consulted about 
important decisions for those with formal citizenship Perhaps half of all 
heads of households across Europe held this status but with substantial 
geographical variations In many German towns guilds were formally
