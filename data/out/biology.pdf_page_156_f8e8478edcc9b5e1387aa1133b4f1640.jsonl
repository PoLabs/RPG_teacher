Figure 53 A hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails comprise this phospholipid molecule The hydrophilic
head group consists of a phosphatecontaining group attached to a glycerol molecule The hydrophobic tails each
containing either a saturated or an unsaturated fatty acid are long hydrocarbon chains
This characteristic is vital to the plasma membranes structure because in water phospholipids arrange
themselves with their hydrophobic tails facing each other and their hydrophilic heads facing out In this way they
form a lipid bilayera double layered phospholipid barrier that separates the water and other materials on one
side from the water and other materials on the other side Phosopholipids heated in an aqueous solution usually
spontaneously form small spheres or droplets micelles or liposomes with their hydrophilic heads forming the
exterior and their hydrophobic tails on the inside Figure 54
