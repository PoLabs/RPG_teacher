time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly In
manner something of the grand seigneur still clung to him so that he
even ripped you up with an air and I have been told that he was a
raconteur of repute He was never more sinister than when he was
most polite which is probably the truest test of breeding and the
elegance of his diction even when he was swearing no less than the
distinction of his demeanour showed him one of a different cast
from his crew A man of indomitable courage it was said that the
only thing he shied at was the sight of his own blood which was
thick and of an unusual colour In dress he somewhat aped the attire
associated with the name of Charles II having heard it said in some
earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the
illfated Stuarts and in his mouth he had a holder of his own
contrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once But
undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw
Let us now kill a pirate to show Hooks method Skylights will
do As they pass Skylights lurches clumsily against him ruffling his
lace collar the hook shoots forth there is a tearing sound and one
screech then the body is kicked aside and the pirates pass on He
has not even taken the cigars from his mouth
Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted Which
will win
On the trail of the pirates stealing noiselessly down the warpath
which is not visible to inexperienced eyes come the redskins every
one of them with his eyes peeled They carry tomahawks and knives
and their naked bodies gleam with paint and oil Strung around them
are scalps of boys as well as of pirates for these are the Piccaninny
tribe and not to be confused with the softerhearted Delawares or the
Hurons In the van on all fours is Great Big Little Panther a brave
of so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede
his progress Bringing up the rear the place of greatest danger
comes Tiger Lily proudly erect a princess in her own right She is
the most beautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies
coquettish cold and amorous by turns there is not a brave who
would not have the wayward thing to wife but she staves off the
altar with a hatchet Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without
making the slightest noise The only sound to be heard is their
somewhat heavy breathing The fact is that they are all a little fat just
now after the heavy gorging but in time they will work this off For
the moment however it constitutes their chief danger
The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows and soon
their place is taken by the beasts a great and motley procession
lions tigers bears and the innumerable smaller savage things that
flee from them for every kind of beast and more particularly all the
maneaters live cheek by jowl on the favoured island Their tongues
are hanging out they are hungry tonight
When they have passed comes the last figure of all a gigantic
crocodile We shall see for whom she is looking presently
The crocodile passes but soon the boys appear again for the
procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or
changes its pace Then quickly they will be on top of each other
