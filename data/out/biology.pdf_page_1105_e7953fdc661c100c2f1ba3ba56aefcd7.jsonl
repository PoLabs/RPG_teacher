Figure 3528 The human brain contains 12 cranial nerves that receive sensory input and control motor output for the
head and neck
Spinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body Each
of the 31 spinal nerves in humans contains both sensory and motor axons The sensory neuron cell bodies are
grouped in structures called dorsal root ganglia and are shown in Figure 3529 Each sensory neuron has one
projectionwith a sensory receptor ending in skin muscle or sensory organsand another that synapses with
a neuron in the dorsal spinal cord Motor neurons have cell bodies in the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord
that project to muscle through the ventral root These neurons are usually stimulated by interneurons within the
spinal cord but are sometimes directly stimulated by sensory neurons
Figure 3529 Spinal nerves contain both sensory and motor axons The somas of sensory neurons are located in
dorsal root ganglia The somas of motor neurons are found in the ventral portion of the gray matter of the spinal cord
