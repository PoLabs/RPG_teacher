in 1892 stimulated scientific research Such research helped contribute to a 
better understanding of infectious diseases and led to improvements in health 
and sanitation Miasma theorythe belief that diseases spread because of bad 
smellsfor example was replaced by germ theory An analysis of Londons 
waste water in the midnineteenth century proved that cholera was caused by 
microbes a discovery that ultimately led to the production of a cholera vaccine 
In addition the introduction of municipal sewer and canalisation systems and 
the further development and broader distribution of the flush toilet further 
improved sanitary conditions in cities by the end of the nineteenth century 
These improvements thus motivated city councils to further centralise and 
regulate water supply and removal systems In the 1860s Britainthe first 
country to address at full scale the environmental effects of industrialisation
passed the socalled Alkali Acts to regulate emissions from the chemical 
industry Gradually other pieces of legislation were introduced but most 
other industrial countries did not follow Britains path before the interwar 
period 19181939
Around 1850 agrochemical scientists and social reformers in Britain and 
Germany such as Edwin Chadwick and Justus Liebig started a transnational 
discussion about the recycling of human waste and other city garbage 
However attempts to establish a kind of circulatory process with the use of 
manure in a sewage farm in Berlin were not successful One reason for this 
failure was the increase of industrial waste within urban waste which made 
the circuit useless Nonetheless the increase of nondegradable waste led to 
advanced garbage collection systems and the first waste incineration plants in 
Nottingham and Hamburg in 1874 and 1896 respectively 
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in response to all the 
challenges that came with urban life organisations and movements were 
founded which strived for the improvement of social and sanitary conditions in 
cities Middleclass social reformers demanded that their municipal authorities 
provide better protection from air and water pollution For example Rudolf 
Virchow 18211902 an early social hygiene reformer in Prussia was a medical 
practitioner who fought for the establishment of hospitals and childrens 
playgrounds in poor districts as well as for medical education for nurses
The sanitary public health or nature preservation movement was also 
strongly connected to scientists from different fields Academics from 
chemistry to political economy warned that the industrialisation process was 
reaching its limits The British economist William Stanley Jevons 18351882 
for example argued that the United Kingdom was bound to lose its advantage 
over other nations because of an overconsumption of coal He predicted that 
economic growth would abate and even decline andfollowing Thomas 
Malthus 17661834imagined a gloomy future in which living conditions
