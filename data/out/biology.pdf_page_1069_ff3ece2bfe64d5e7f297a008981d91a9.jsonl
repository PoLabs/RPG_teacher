about a piece of chocolate or a crispy potato chip the increase in salivation is a cephalic phase response to the
thought The central nervous system prepares the stomach to receive food
The gastric phase begins once the food arrives in the stomach It builds on the stimulation provided during
the cephalic phase Gastric acids and enzymes process the ingested materials The gastric phase is stimulated
by 1 distension of the stomach 2 a decrease in the pH of the gastric contents and 3 the presence of
undigested material This phase consists of local hormonal and neural responses These responses stimulate
secretions and powerful contractions
The intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions This phase
controls the rate of gastric emptying In addition to gastrin emptying when chyme enters the small intestine it
triggers other hormonal and neural events that coordinate the activities of the intestinal tract pancreas liver and
gallbladder
Hormonal Responses to Food
The endocrine system controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at
the appropriate times
One of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment During the gastric phase
the hormone gastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins Gastrin
stimulates the release of stomach acid or hydrochloric acid HCl which aids in the digestion of the proteins
However when the stomach is emptied the acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called
somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid This is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism
In the duodenum digestive secretions from the liver pancreas and gallbladder play an important role in
digesting chyme during the intestinal phase In order to neutralize the acidic chyme a hormone called secretin
stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum Secretin acts
in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin CCK Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to
produce the requisite pancreatic juices it also stimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum

Another level of hormonal control occurs in response to the composition of food Foods high in lipids take a long
time to digest A hormone called gastric inhibitory peptide is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the
peristaltic movements of the intestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed
Understanding the hormonal control of the digestive system is an important area of ongoing research Scientists
are exploring the role of each hormone in the digestive process and developing ways to target these hormones
Advances could lead to knowledge that may help to battle the obesity epidemic
