The conceptual scope of urban heritage and its legal definition was debated 
and refined by prominent nineteenthcentury intellectuals who each had 
different views about the protection of threatened monuments and buildings 
and their role in rapidly growing industrial cities Urban growth was one of 
the major challenges for nineteenthcentury Europe This challenge led to the 
gradual institutionalisation of urban planningthe methodology and the 
discipline of managing urban development and its social consequences In 
this context urban heritage did not seem to be a priority since it represented 
the past the deteriorating urban residue which rational urban planning was 
seeking to transcend Nevertheless the restructuring and redesign of the 
historic centres of European capitals such as Barcelona London Paris Rome 
or Vienna immediately raised objections from intellectuals and locals who 
felt nostalgic for and attached to the threatened urban past This dilemma
stemming from the conflict between urban development and the preservation 
of urban heritageelicited different responses from different quarters which 
are fundamental for the practice of urban planning even today
These major responsesembodied in particular theories and practices
can be illustrated by three classic works John Ruskins The Stones of Venice 
London 18511853 Eugne ViolletleDucs Entretiens sur larchitecture 
Paris 18581872 and Camillo Sittes Der Stdtebau nach seinen knstlerischen 
Grundstzen Vienna 1889 Ruskin 18191900 an English writer and 
philosopher regarded the historic city as an organism in which decay ie 
the eventual destruction of historic buildings and monuments is acceptable 
as in nature Thus the authenticity of the European city lies in its capacity for 
survival development and reconstruction In contrast the French architect 
VioletleDuc 18141879 refused reconstruction in the name of historical 
authenticity and fought for the development both in practice and in theory 
of monument protection In his renovation projectsas in the old town of 
Carcassonne the City Hall of Narbonne or several medieval cathedrals such 
as the NotreDame of Parishe placed the urban quarter or monument in a 
polished and imaginary past which became a static enclave within the urban 
environment The Austrian architect and urban theorist Camillo Sitte 1843
1903 appreciated the irregularity of premodern cities and towns in opposition 
to the standardised urban spaces imposed by modern and contemporary 
architecture Thus he considered historic European cities as principal reference 
points for modern urban design which he felt should not be rejected or 
separated but rather integrated within urban development Though standards 
of urban heritage protection were subsequently defined to favour renovation 
over reconstruction and to separate and demarcate the historic urban quarter 
from the rest of the city the organic and integrative theories and practices
