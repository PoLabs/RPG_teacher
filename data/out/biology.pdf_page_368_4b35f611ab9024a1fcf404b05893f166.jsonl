female ova
a
anther
b
pistil
c
stigma
d
seed
6 Which is one of the seven characteristics that
Mendel observed in pea plants
a
flower size
b
seed texture
c
leaf shape
d
stem color
7 Imagine you are performing a cross involving seed
color in garden pea plants What F1 offspring would
you expect if you cross truebreeding parents with
green seeds and yellow seeds Yellow seed color is
dominant over green
a
100 percent yellowgreen seeds
b
100 percent yellow seeds
c
50 percent yellow 50 percent green seeds
d
25 percent green 75 percent yellow seeds
8 Consider a cross to investigate the pea pod texture
trait involving constricted or inflated pods Mendel
found that the traits behave according to a dominant
recessive pattern in which inflated pods were
dominant If you performed this cross and obtained
650 inflatedpod plants in the F2 generation
approximately how many constrictedpod plants
would you expect to have
a
600
b
165
c
217
d
468
9 A scientist pollinates a truebreeding pea plant with
violet terminal flowers with pollen from a true
breeding pea plant with white axial flowers Which of
the following observations would most accurately
describe the F2 generation
a
75 violet flowers 75 terminal flowers
b
75 white flowers in a terminal position
c
75 violet flowers 75 axial flowers
d
75 violet flowers in an axial position
10 The observable traits expressed by an organism
are described as its ________
a
phenotype
b
genotype
c
alleles
d
zygote
11 A recessive trait will be observed in individuals
that are ________ for that trait
a
heterozygous
b
homozygous or heterozygous
c
homozygous
d
diploid
12 If black and white truebreeding mice are mated
and the result is all gray offspring what inheritance
pattern would this be indicative of
a
dominance
b
codominance
c
multiple alleles
d
incomplete dominance
13 The ABO blood groups in humans are expressed
as the IA IB and i alleles The IA allele encodes the
A blood group antigen IB encodes B and i encodes
O Both A and B are dominant to O If a
heterozygous blood type A parent IAi and a
heterozygous blood type B parent IBi mate one
quarter of their offspring will have AB blood type
IAIB in which both antigens are expressed equally
Therefore ABO blood groups are an example of
a
multiple alleles and incomplete dominance
b
codominance and incomplete dominance
c
incomplete dominance only
d
multiple alleles and codominance
14 In a mating between two individuals that are
heterozygous for a recessive lethal allele that is
expressed in utero what genotypic ratio
homozygous dominantheterozygoushomozygous
recessive would you expect to observe in the
offspring
a
121
b
311
c
120
d
021
15 If the allele encoding polydactyly six fingers is
dominant why do most people have five fingers
a
Genetic elements suppress the polydactyl
gene
b
Polydactyly is embryonic lethal
c
The sixth finger is removed at birth
d
The polydactyl allele is very rare in the
human population
16 A farmer raises black and white chickens To his
surprise when the first generation of eggs hatch all
the chickens are black with white speckles
throughout their feathers What should the farmer
expect when the eggs laid after interbreeding the
speckled chickens hatch
a
All the offspring will be speckled
b
75 of the offspring will be speckled and
25 will be black
c
50 of the offspring will be speckled 25
will be black and 25 will be white
d
50 of the offspring will be black and 50
of the offspring will be white
17 Assuming no gene linkage in a dihybrid cross of
AABB x aabb with AaBb F1 heterozygotes what is
the ratio of the F1 gametes AB aB Ab ab that will
give rise to the F2 offspring
