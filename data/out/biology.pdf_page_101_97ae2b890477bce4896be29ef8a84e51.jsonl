Protein Structure
As we discussed earlier a proteins shape is critical to its function For example an enzyme can bind to a specific
substrate at an active site If this active site is altered because of local changes or changes in overall protein
structure the enzyme may be unable to bind to the substrate To understand how the protein gets its final shape
or conformation we need to understand the four levels of protein structure primary secondary tertiary and
quaternary
Primary Structure
Amino acids unique sequence in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure For example the pancreatic
hormone insulin has two polypeptide chains A and B and they are linked together by disulfide bonds The N
terminal amino acid of the A chain is glycine whereas the C terminal amino acid is asparagine Figure 325
The amino acid sequences in the A and B chains are unique to insulin
Figure 325 Bovine serum insulin is a protein hormone comprised of two peptide chains A 21 amino acids long and
B 30 amino acids long In each chain threeletter abbreviations that represent the amino acids names in the order
they are present indicate primary structure The amino acid cysteine cys has a sulfhydryl SH group as a side chain
Two sulfhydryl groups can react in the presence of oxygen to form a disulfide SS bond Two disulfide bonds connect
the A and B chains together and a third helps the A chain fold into the correct shape Note that all disulfide bonds are
the same length but we have drawn them different sizes for clarity
The gene encoding the protein ultimately determines the unique sequence for every protein A change in
nucleotide sequence of the genes coding region may lead to adding a different amino acid to the growing
polypeptide chain causing a change in protein structure and function In sickle cell anemia the hemoglobin 
chain a small portion of which we show in Figure 326 has a single amino acid substitution causing a change
in protein structure and function Specifically valine in the  chain substitutes the amino acid glutamic What
is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is comprised of two alpha and two beta chains
that each consist of about 150 amino acids The molecule therefore has about 600 amino acids The structural
difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell moleculewhich dramatically decreases life
expectancyis a single amino acid of the 600 What is even more remarkable is that three nucleotides each
encode those 600 amino acids and a single base change point mutation 1 in 1800 bases causes the mutation
