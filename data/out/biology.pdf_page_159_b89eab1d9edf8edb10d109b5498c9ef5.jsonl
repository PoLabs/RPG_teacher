How Viruses Infect Specific Organs
Glycoprotein and glycolipid patterns on the cells surfaces give many viruses an opportunity for infection
HIV and hepatitis viruses infect only specific organs or cells in the human body HIV is able to penetrate
the plasma membranes of a subtype of lymphocytes called Thelper cells as well as some monocytes and
central nervous system cells The hepatitis virus attacks liver cells
These viruses are able to invade these cells because the cells have binding sites on their surfaces that are
specific to and compatible with certain viruses Figure 56 Other recognition sites on the viruss surface
interact with the human immune system prompting the body to produce antibodies Antibodies are made
in response to the antigens or proteins associated with invasive pathogens or in response to foreign cells
such as might occur with an organ transplant These same sites serve as places for antibodies to attach
and either destroy or inhibit the virus activity Unfortunately these recognition sites on HIV change at a
rapid rate because of mutations making an effective vaccine against the virus very difficult as the virus
evolves and adapts A person infected with HIV will quickly develop different populations or variants of the
virus that differences in these recognition sites distinguish This rapid change of surface markers decreases
the effectiveness of the persons immune system in attacking the virus because the antibodies will not
recognize the surface patterns new variations In the case of HIV the problem is compounded because the
virus specifically infects and destroys cells involved in the immune response further incapacitating the host

Membrane Fluidity
The membranes mosaic characteristic helps to illustrate its nature The integral proteins and lipids exist in the
membrane as separate but loosely attached molecules These resemble the separate multicolored tiles of a
mosaic picture and they float moving somewhat with respect to one another The membrane is not like a
balloon however that can expand and contract rather it is fairly rigid and can burst if penetrated or if a cell takes
in too much water However because of its mosaic nature a very fine needle can easily penetrate a plasma
