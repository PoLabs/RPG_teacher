vast marble hall About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high
stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing
coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses
There were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more
goblins were showing people in and out of these Hagrid and Harry made
for the counter
Morning said Hagrid to a free goblin Weve come ter take some money
outta Mr Harry Potters safe
You have his key Sir
Got it here somewhere said Hagrid and he started emptying his
pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits
over the goblins book of numbers The goblin wrinkled his nose Harry
watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as
glowing coals
Got it said Hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key
The goblin looked at it closely
That seems to be in order
An Ive also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore said Hagrid
importantly throwing out his chest Its about the YouKnowWhat in
vault seven hundred and thirteen
The goblin read the letter carefully
Very well he said handing it back to Hagrid I will have Someone
take you down to both vaults Griphook
Griphook was yet another goblin Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog
biscuits back inside his pockets he and Harry followed Griphook toward
one of the doors leading off the hall
Whats the YouKnowWhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen Harry
asked
Cant tell yeh that said Hagrid mysteriously Very secret Hogwarts
business Dumbledores trusted me Moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh
that
