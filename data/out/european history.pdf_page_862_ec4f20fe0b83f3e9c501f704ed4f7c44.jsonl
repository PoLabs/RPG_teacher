was the Bolshevik revolutionary leader Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov alias Lenin 
18701924 who explicitly attributed a political role to the avantgardist at 
the beginning of the twentieth century By that time the term was particularly 
linked to the arts due to a notion that art more than any other domain most 
challenged mainstream ideas and values Artist and art critic Alexandre Benois 
18701960 was the first to use the term in art criticism in a negative way to 
describe the works of some young artists who had rejected the idea of beauty 
1910 The artists of the beginning of the twentieth century that we consider 
avantgarde today did not always use this word however and they never 
used it to label themselves It only became an accepted term in art history in 
the 1960s
The background for these artistic developments was the incredibly turbulent 
era around the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries a period marked 
by new inventions innovations explorations developments by scientists 
engineers researchers and travellers The results of these changes became 
widely known among ordinary people and had a deep impact on their thought 
as well as their daytoday lives Science became a reference point for artistic 
life and vice versa as intuition in research an ability traditionally attributed to 
artists became more appreciated as a guide for formulating new professional 
goals Many Russian avantgarde artists such as Kazimir Malevich Wassily 
Kandinsky Mikhail Larionov and Pavel Filonov believed that the process 
of creating art was similar to a series of experiments in physics or chemistry 
and equal to them as a relevant way of acquiring knowledge about the world 
at large Still avantgarde artists were not uncritical of the growing impact of 
science in life and many lamented its rational and materialistic dimension 
Most famously Kandinsky argued in 1910 for an art that would not rely on 
the material world but rather on the expression of the artists inner selves an 
idea that strongly impacted avantgardist circles and that arguably can also 
be regarded as one of the core ideas behind avantgarde art
Another important feature of the avantgarde concept was an eagerness 
to eliminate borders between creating art and living The new ideal was the 
inventorengineerartist whose works merged art and the everyday life of 
the masses Artists also wanted to participate in the production processes 
of the world of which they were a part and functionality was interpreted as 
an aesthetic category Industrial design became a matter for artists Vladimir 
Tatlins famous Monument to the Third International 19191920 was an 
impressive representation of the way in which the symbolic meaning of the 
construction of an object became crucialeven though it was never actually 
built An interesting experiment of living  lavantgarde was carried out by 
the group UNOVIS in the Belarusian city of Vitebsk in 19191921 the artists 
transformed the city centre into an openair museum of Suprematism with
