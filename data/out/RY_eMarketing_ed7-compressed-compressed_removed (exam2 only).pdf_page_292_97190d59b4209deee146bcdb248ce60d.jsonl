Tracking and analysis
Kaushik 2007 recommends a threepronged approach to analytics
	
Analysing behaviour data infers the intent 
of a user Why are users visiting
	
Analysing outcome metrics shows how 
many users performed the goal actions 
Are visitors completing the goals we want 
them to
	
A wide range of data tells us about the user experience What are the patterns of user 
behaviour How can we influence them so that we achieve our objectives
2051 Behaviour
Behaviour can indicate a lot about a users intent By studying data you can infer which problems 
visitors are expecting your website or app to solve
Some methods to gauge the intent of your visitors include
	
Click density analysis Looking at a heatmap to see where users are clicking on the site 
and if there are any noteworthy clumps of clicks For instance many users clicking on a 
page element that is not actually a button or link
	
Segmentation Selecting a smaller group of visitors to analyse based on a shared char
acteristic This lets you see if particular types of visitors behave differently
	
Behaviour and content metrics Analysing data around user behaviours eg time spent 
on site or the number of pages viewed can give a lot of insight into how engaging and 
valuable your website is Looking at content metrics will show you which pages are the most 
popular as well as which ones users leave most often providing excellent insight for your 
content marketing strategy as well as indicating what your audience is really interested in
2052 Outcomes
Ultimately you want users who visit your website to perform an action that increases your 
revenue Analysing goals and KPIs indicates where there is room for improvement Look at 
user intent to establish if your website meets users goals and if these match with the website 
goals Look at user experience to determine how outcomes can be influenced
