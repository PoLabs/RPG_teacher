Meiosis II
In some species cells enter a brief interphase or interkinesis before entering meiosis II Interkinesis lacks an
S phase so chromosomes are not duplicated The two cells produced in meiosis I go through the events of
meiosis II in synchrony During meiosis II the sister chromatids within the two daughter cells separate forming
four new haploid gametes The mechanics of meiosis II are similar to mitosis except that each dividing cell has
only one set of homologous chromosomes each with two chromatids Therefore each cell has half the number
of sister chromatids to separate out as a diploid cell undergoing mitosis In terms of chromosomal content cells
at the start of meiosis II are similar to haploid cells in G2 preparing to undergo mitosis
Prophase II
If the chromosomes decondensed in telophase I they condense again If nuclear envelopes were formed they
fragment into vesicles The MTOCs that were duplicated during interkinesis move away from each other toward
opposite poles and new spindles are formed
Prometaphase II
The nuclear envelopes are completely broken down and the spindle is fully formed Each sister chromatid forms
an individual kinetochore that attaches to microtubules from opposite poles
Metaphase II
The sister chromatids are maximally condensed and aligned at the equator of the cell
Anaphase II
The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the kinetochore microtubules and move toward opposite poles
Nonkinetochore microtubules elongate the cell
