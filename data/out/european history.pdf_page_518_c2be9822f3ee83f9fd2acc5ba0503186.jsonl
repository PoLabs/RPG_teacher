that Petrarch started to give a voice to scholars who were attempting to 
breathe new life into Roman antiquity as well as Greek antiquity from the 
early fifteenth century The new studia humanitatis were implemented at the 
schools of famous humanist educators such as Gasparino Barzizza 1360
1430 Guarino da Verona and Vittorino da Feltre 137314461447 They 
were also the endeavour of a mass of lesserknown people who worked at the 
grassroots level implementing the pragmatic focus on rhetoric the pedagogic 
genre of manuals and textbooks and the aspiration to go back to classical 
sources Meanwhile the economic upsurge of northern Italy had led to an 
increased focus on the teaching of merchant skills such as handling the abbaco 
counting frame and doubleentry bookkeeping From the thirteenth century 
onwards up until the end of the nineteenth century the transfer of vocational 
knowledge across Europe was largely channelled via the guilds where the

of the more peculiar institutions that was rooted in the guild system was the 
university
Although humanists were active at the universities it proved more difficult 
to change the curricula of these conservative institutions which continued to 
be dominated by theology faculties until the end of the early modern period 
Universities retained the base hierarchy of three major facultiestheology law

teachingseven at a time when philosophers across Europe were adopting 
thoughts and methods from philologists and other philosophers like Joseph 
Scaliger Isaac Casaubon Francis Bacon Ren Descartes and Marin Mersenne 
Voetius stuck to Calvin but also and somewhat counterintuitively clung to 
Catholic commentators from the School of Coimbra Despite all the religious 
differences throughout Europe the hierarchy and methods in science and 
scholarship were surprisingly similar across the continent 
The Organisation of Teaching
Although Erasmus in his Colloquies frequently staged women who outsmarted 
their male interlocutors in their own fields academia kept its doors closed to 
women Even if Voetius in Utrecht famously allowed the polymath Anna Maria 
van Schurman to follow his public lectures from behind a curtain and even if
