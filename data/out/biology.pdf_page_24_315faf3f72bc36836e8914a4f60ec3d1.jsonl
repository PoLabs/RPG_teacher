While this warm classroom example is based on observational results other hypotheses and experiments
might have clearer controls For instance a student might attend class on Monday and realize she had difficulty
concentrating on the lecture One observation to explain this occurrence might be When I eat breakfast before
class I am better able to pay attention The student could then design an experiment with a control to test this
hypothesis
In hypothesisbased science researchers predict specific results from a general premise We call this type of
reasoning deductive reasoning deduction proceeds from the general to the particular However the reverse
of the process is also possible sometimes scientists reach a general conclusion from a number of specific
observations We call this type of reasoning inductive reasoning and it proceeds from the particular to the
general Researchers often use inductive and deductive reasoning in tandem to advance scientific knowledge
