Role of Prokaryotes in Ecosystems
Prokaryotes are ubiquitous There is no niche or ecosystem in which they are not present Prokaryotes play
many roles in the environments they occupy The roles they play in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are vital
to life on Earth In addition the current scientific consensus suggests that metabolically interactive prokaryotic
communities may have been the basis for the emergence of eukaryotic cells
Prokaryotes and the Carbon Cycle
Carbon is one of the most important macronutrients and prokaryotes play an important role in the carbon cycle
Figure 2218 The carbon cycle traces the movement of carbon from inorganic to organic compounds and
back again Carbon is cycled through Earths major reservoirs land the atmosphere aquatic environments
sediments and rocks and biomass In a way the carbon cycle echoes the role of the four elements first
proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles fire water earth and air Carbon dioxide is removed
from the atmosphere by land plants and marine prokaryotes and is returned to the atmosphere via the
respiration of chemoorganotrophic organisms including prokaryotes fungi and animals Although the largest
carbon reservoir in terrestrial ecosystems is in rocks and sediments that carbon is not readily available
Participants in the carbon cycle are roughly divided among producers consumers and decomposers of organic
carbon compounds The primary producers of organic carbon compounds from CO2 are land plants and
photosynthetic bacteria A large amount of available carbon is found in living land plants A related source of
carbon compounds is humus which is a mixture of organic materials from dead plants and prokaryotes that
have resisted decomposition The term humus by the way is the root of the word human Consumers
such as animals and other heterotrophs use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon
dioxide to the atmosphere Other bacteria and fungi collectively called decomposers carry out the breakdown
decomposition of plants and animals and their organic compounds Most carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is
derived from the respiration of microorganisms that decompose dead animals plants and humus
In aqueous environments and their anoxic sediments there is another carbon cycle taking place In this case the
cycle is based on onecarbon compounds In anoxic sediments prokaryotes mostly archaea produce methane
CH4 This methane moves into the zone above the sediment which is richer in oxygen and supports bacteria
called methane oxidizers that oxidize methane to carbon dioxide which then returns to the atmosphere
