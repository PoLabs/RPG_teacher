Over 23 of the approximately 330 living species of marsupials are found in Australia with the rest nearly all
various types of opossum found in the Americas especially South America Australian marsupials include the
kangaroo koala bandicoot Tasmanian devil Figure 2941 and several other species Like monotremes the
embryos of marsupials are nourished during a short gestational period about a month in kangaroos by a yolk
sac placenta but with no intervening egg shell Some marsupial embryos can enter an embryonic diapause
and delay implantation suspending development until implantation is completed Marsupial young are also
effectively fetal at birth Most but not all species of marsupials possess a pouch in which the very premature
young reside receiving milk and continuing their development In kangaroos the young joeys continue to nurse
for about a year and a half

Eutherians placentals are the most widespread and numerous of the mammals occurring throughout
the world Eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals because all species possess a
complex chorioallantoic placenta that connects a fetus to the mother allowing for gas fluid and nutrient
exchange There are about 4000 species of placental mammals in 18 to 20 orders with various adaptations
for burrowing flying swimming hunting running and climbing In the evolutionary sense they have been
incredibly successful in form diversity and abundance The eutherian mammals are classified in two major
clades the Atlantogenata and the Boreoeutheria The Atlantogeneta include the Afrotheria eg elephants
hyraxes and manatees and the Xenarthra anteaters armadillos and sloths The Boreoeutheria contain two
large groups the Euarchontoglires and the Laurasiatheria Familiar orders in the Euarchontoglires are the
Scandentia tree shrews Rodentia rats mice squirrels porcupines Lagomorpha rabbits and hares and the
Primates including humans Major Laurasiatherian orders include the Perissodactyla eg horses and rhinos
the Cetartiodactyla eg cows giraffes pigs hippos and whales the Carnivora eg cats dogs and bears
and the Chiroptera bats and flying foxes The two largest orders are the rodents 2000 species and bats
about 1000 species which together constitute approximately 60 percent of all eutherian species
