only healthy faces were worn by those immigrants who had just arrived In fact there were more deaths due to
malaria in Michigan than those from the Civil War
We now know that malaria is caused by several species of the apicomplexan protist genus Plasmodium
Members of Plasmodium must sequentially require both a mosquito and a vertebrate to complete their life cycle
In vertebrates the parasite develops in liver cells the exoerythrocytic stage and goes on to infect red blood
cells the erythrocytic stage bursting from and destroying the blood cells with each asexual replication cycle
Figure 2334 Of the four Plasmodium species known to infect humans P falciparum accounts for 50 percent
of all malaria cases and is the primary and deadliest cause of diseaserelated fatalities in tropical regions of the
world In 2015 it was estimated that malaria caused over 400000 deaths mostly in African children During the
course of malaria P falciparum can infect and destroy more than onehalf of a humans circulating blood cells
leading to severe anemia In response to waste products released as the parasites burst from infected blood
cells the host immune system mounts a massive inflammatory response with episodes of deliriuminducing
fever paroxysms as parasites lyse red blood cells spilling parasite waste into the bloodstream P falciparum
is transmitted to humans by the African mosquito Anopheles gambiae Techniques to kill sterilize or avoid
exposure to this highly aggressive mosquito species are crucial to malaria control Ironically a type of genetic
control has arisen in parts of the world where malaria is endemic Possession of one copy of the HbS beta
globin allele results in malaria resistance Unfortunately this allele also has an unfortunate second effect when
homozygous it causes sickle cell disease

Trypanosomes
Trypanosoma brucei Figure 2335 transmitted by tsetse flies Glossina spp in Africa and related flies in South
America is an flagellated endoparasite responsible for the deadly disease nagana in cattle and horses and for
African sleeping sickness in humans This trypanosome confounds the human immune system by changing its
thick layer of surface glycoproteins with each infectious cycle The glycoproteins are identified by the immune
system as foreign antigens and a specific antibody defense is mounted against the parasite However T brucei
has thousands of possible antigens and with each subsequent generation the protist switches to a glycoprotein
coating with a different molecular structure In this way T brucei is capable of replicating continuously without
the immune system ever succeeding in clearing the parasite Without treatment T brucei attacks red blood
