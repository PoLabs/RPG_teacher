There is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or Homo sapiens sapiens As
discussed earlier H erectus migrated out of Africa and into Asia and Europe in the first major wave of migration
about 15 million years ago It is thought that modern humans arose in Africa from H erectus and migrated out of
Africa about 100000 years ago in a second major migration wave Then modern humans replaced H erectus
species that had migrated into Asia and Europe in the first wave
This evolutionary timeline is supported by molecular evidence One approach to studying the origins of modern
humans is to examine mitochondrial DNA mtDNA from populations around the world Because a fetus develops
from an egg containing its mothers mitochondria which have their own nonnuclear DNA mtDNA is passed
entirely through the maternal line Mutations in mtDNA can now be used to estimate the timeline of genetic
divergence The resulting evidence suggests that all modern humans have mtDNA inherited from a common
ancestor that lived in Africa about 160000 years ago Another approach to the molecular understanding of
human evolution is to examine the Y chromosome which is passed from father to son This evidence suggests
that all men today inherited a Y chromosome from a male that lived in Africa about 140000 years ago
The study of mitochondrial DNA led to the identification of another human species or subspecies the
Denisovans DNA from teeth and finger bones suggested two things First the mitochondrial DNA was different
from that of both modern humans and Neanderthals Second the genomic DNA suggested that the Denisovans
shared a common ancestor with the Neanderthals Genes from both Neanderthals and Denisovans have been
identified in modern human populations indicating that interbreeding among the three groups occurred over part
of their range
