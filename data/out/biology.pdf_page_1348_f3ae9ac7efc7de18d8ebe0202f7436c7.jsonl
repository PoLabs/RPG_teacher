Figure 434 Sea stars can reproduce through fragmentation The large arm a fragment from another sea star is
developing into a new individual
Note that in fragmentation there is generally a noticeable difference in the size of the individuals whereas in
fission two individuals of approximate size are formed
Parthenogenesis
Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without
being fertilized The resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid depending on the process and the
species Parthenogenesis occurs in invertebrates such as water fleas rotifers aphids stick insects some ants
wasps and bees Bees use parthenogenesis to produce haploid males drones If eggs are fertilized diploid
females develop and if the fertilized eggs are fed a special diet so called royal jelly a queen is produced

parthenogenesis Although more common in plants parthenogenesis has been observed in animal species that
were segregated by sex in terrestrial or marine zoos Two female Komodo dragons a hammerhead shark and
a blacktop shark have produced parthenogenic young when the females have been isolated from males
Sexual Reproduction
Sexual reproduction is the combination of usually haploid reproductive cells from two individuals to form a third
usually diploid unique offspring Sexual reproduction produces offspring with novel combinations of genes This
can be an adaptive advantage in unstable or unpredictable environments As humans we are used to thinking
of animals as having two separate sexesmale and femaledetermined at conception However in the animal
kingdom there are many variations on this theme
Hermaphroditism
Hermaphroditism occurs in animals where one individual has both male and female reproductive parts
Invertebrates such as earthworms slugs tapeworms and snails shown in Figure 435 are often
hermaphroditic Hermaphrodites may selffertilize or may mate with another of their species fertilizing each other
and both producing offspring Self fertilization is common in animals that have limited mobility or are not motile
such as barnacles and clams
