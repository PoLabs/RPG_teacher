The Man with the Twisted Lip
others talked together in a strange low monotonous
voice their conversation coming in gushes and then
suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out
his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words
of his neighbour
At the farther end was a small
brazier of burning charcoal beside which on a three
legged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old man
with his jaw resting upon his two sts and his elbows
upon his knees staring into the re
As I entered a sallow Malay attendant had hur
ried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug
beckoning me to an empty berth
Thank you
I have not come to stay said I
There is a friend of mine here Mr Isa Whitney and
I wish to speak with him
There was a movement and an exclamation from
my right and peering through the gloom I saw Whit
ney pale haggard and unkempt staring out at me
My God Its Watson said he He was in a
pitiable state of reaction with every nerve in a twitter
I say Watson what oclock is it
Nearly eleven
Of what day
Of Friday June 19th
Good heavens I thought it was Wednesday It is
Wednesday What dyou want to frighten a chap for
He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a
high treble key
I tell you that it is Friday man Your wife has
been waiting this two days for you You should be
ashamed of yourself
So I am But youve got mixed Watson for I
have only been here a few hours three pipes four
pipesI forget how many But Ill go home with you
I wouldnt frighten Katepoor little Kate Give me
your hand Have you a cab
Yes I have one waiting
Then I shall go in it But I must owe something
Find what I owe Watson I am all off colour I can do
nothing for myself
I walked down the narrow passage between the
double row of sleepers holding my breath to keep
out the vile stupefying fumes of the drug and look
ing about for the manager As I passed the tall man
who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my
skirt and a low voice whispered Walk past me and
then look back at me The words fell quite distinctly
upon my ear I glanced down They could only have
come from the old man at my side and yet he sat
now as absorbed as ever very thin very wrinkled
bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from
between his knees as though it had dropped in sheer
lassitude from his ngers I took two steps forward
and looked back It took all my selfcontrol to prevent
me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment He
had turned his back so that none could see him but I
His form had lled out his wrinkles were gone the
dull eyes had regained their re and there sitting by
the re and grinning at my surprise was none other
than Sherlock Holmes He made a slight motion to
me to approach him and instantly as he turned his
face half round to the company once more subsided
into a doddering looselipped senility
Holmes I whispered what on earth are you
doing in this den
As low as you can he answered I have ex
cellent ears If you would have the great kindness
to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be
exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you
I have a cab outside
Then pray send him home in it You may safely
trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into
any mischief I should recommend you also to send a
note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have
thrown in your lot with me If you will wait outside
I shall be with you in ve minutes
It was difcult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes
requests for they were always so exceedingly denite
and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery I
felt however that when Whitney was once conned
in the cab my mission was practically accomplished
and for the rest I could not wish anything better than
to be associated with my friend in one of those sin
gular adventures which were the normal condition
of his existence In a few minutes I had written my
note paid Whitneys bill led him out to the cab and
seen him driven through the darkness In a very short
time a decrepit gure had emerged from the opium
den and I was walking down the street with Sherlock
Holmes For two streets he shufed along with a bent
back and an uncertain foot Then glancing quickly
round he straightened himself out and burst into a
hearty t of laughter
I suppose Watson said he that you imagine
that I have added opiumsmoking to cocaine injec
tions and all the other little weaknesses on which you
have favoured me with your medical views
I was certainly surprised to nd you there
But not more so than I to nd you
I came to nd a friend
And I to nd an enemy
