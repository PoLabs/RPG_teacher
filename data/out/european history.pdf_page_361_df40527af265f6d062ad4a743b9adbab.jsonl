bloody war with French British and Russian intervention in 1830 Greece 
became an independent state
A new revolutionary cycle began in 1830 Initiated in France where the 
Bourbons were replaced by the bourgeois King Louis Philippe dOrlans 
17731850 its effects were felt across the continent This wave of revolutions 
combined national and liberal goals Only one was successful Belgium 
obtained independence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands and established 
a constitutional monarchy But repression was the norm in the rest of the 
continent The Polish insurrectionariessome moderate liberals some 
republicanswere defeated by the Russian Army initiating a long period of 
exile Likewise uprisings in the Italian Peninsula were suppressed and some

revolutionary turbulence British politics were shaped by measured reform 
and steady progress The truth is that the United Kingdom was shaped by
