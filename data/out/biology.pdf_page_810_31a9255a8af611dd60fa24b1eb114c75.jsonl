polyp stage The polyp reproduces asexually by budding and the medusa reproduces sexually credit medusa

Class Cubozoa
This class includes jellies that have a boxshaped medusa or a bell that is square in crosssection and are
colloquially known as box jellyfish These species may achieve sizes of 15 to 25 cm but typically members of
the Cubozoa are not as large as those of the Scyphozoa However cubozoans display overall morphological and
anatomical characteristics that are similar to those of the scyphozoans A prominent difference between the two
classes is the arrangement of tentacles The cubozoans contain muscular pads called pedalia at the corners
of the square bell canopy with one or more tentacles attached to each pedalium In some cases the digestive
system may extend into the pedalia Nematocysts may be arranged in a spiral configuration along the tentacles
this arrangement helps to effectively subdue and capture prey Cubozoans include the most venomous of all the
cnidarians Figure 2811
These animals are unusual in having imageforming eyes including a cornea lens and retina Because these
structures are made from a number of interactive tissues they can be called true organs Eyes are located in
four clusters between each pair of pedalia Each cluster consists of four simple eye spots plus two imageforming
eyes oriented in different directions How images formed by these very complex eyes are processed remains
a mystery since cubozoans have extensive nerve nets but no distinct brain Nontheless the presence of eyes
helps the cubozoans to be active and effective hunters of small marine animals like worms arthropods and fish
Cubozoans have separate sexes and fertilization occurs inside the female Planula larvae may develop inside
the female or be released depending on species Each planula develops into a polyp These polyps may bud to
form more polyps to create a colony each polyp then transforms into a single medusa
