I mean after that open and revolting foul
Jordan Im warning you 
All right all right Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker which
could happen to anyone Im sure so a penalty to Gryffindor taken by
Spinner who puts it away no trouble and we continue play Gryffindor
still in possession
It was as Harry dodged another Bludger which went spinning dangerously
past his head that it happened His broom gave a sudden frightening
lurch For a split second he thought he was going to fall He gripped
the broom tightly with both his hands and knees Hed never felt
anything like that
It happened again It was as though the broom was trying to buck him
off But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their
riders off Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts
 he had half a mind to ask Wood to call timeout  and then he
realized that his broom was completely out of his control He couldnt
turn it He couldnt direct it at all It was zigzagging through the
air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that
almost unseated him
Lee was still commentating
Slytherin in possession  Flint with the Quaffle  passes Spinnet 
passes Bell  hit hard in the face by a Bludger hope it broke his nose
 only joking Professor  Slytherins score  A no
The Slytherins were cheering No one seemed to have noticed that Harrys
broom was behaving strangely It was carrying him slowly higher away
from the game jerking and twitching as it went
Dunno what Harry thinks hes doing Hagrid mumbled He stared through
his binoculars If I didn know better Id say hed lost control of
his broom but he cant have
Suddenly people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands His
broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to
hold on Then the whole crowd gasped Harrys broom had given a wild
jerk and Harry swung off it He was now dangling from it holding on
with only one hand
