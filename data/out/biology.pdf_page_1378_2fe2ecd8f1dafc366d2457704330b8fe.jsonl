propelled by hormones The first trimester lays down the basic structures of the body including the limb buds
heart eyes and the liver The second trimester continues the development of all of the organs and systems
The third trimester exhibits the greatest growth of the fetus and culminates in labor and delivery Prevention of
a pregnancy can be accomplished through a variety of methods including barriers hormones or other means
Assisted reproductive technologies may help individuals who have infertility problems
436 Fertilization and Early Embryonic Development
The early stages of embryonic development begin with fertilization The process of fertilization is tightly
controlled to ensure that only one sperm fuses with one egg After fertilization the zygote undergoes cleavage
to form the blastula The blastula which in some species is a hollow ball of cells undergoes a process called
gastrulation in which the three germ layers form The ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the
epidermal skin cells the mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body and the
endoderm gives rise to columnar cells and internal organs
437 Organogenesis and Vertebrate Formation
Organogenesis is the formation of organs from the germ layers Each germ layer gives rise to specific tissue
types The first stage is the formation of the neural system in the ectoderm The mesoderm gives rise to
somites and the notochord Formation of vertebrate axis is another important developmental stage

2 Figure 4315 Which of the following statements
about hormone regulation of the female reproductive
cycle is false
a
LH and FSH are produced in the pituitary
and estradiol and progesterone are
produced in the ovaries
b

the corpus luteum cause the endometrium
to thicken
c
Both progesterone and estradiol are
produced by the follicles
d

levels drop
d
Estrogen levels rise before ovulation while
progesterone levels rise after
