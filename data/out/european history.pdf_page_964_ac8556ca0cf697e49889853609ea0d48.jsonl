heritage preservation is thought to have started with the Athens Charter for 
the Restoration of Historic Monuments in 1931 which was assembled by the 
participants of the First International Congress of Architects and Technicians 
of Historic Monuments organised by the International Museums Office 
to provide the first internationally approved norms of the preservation of 
historic cities and sites However this standardisation became systematic only 
with the Venice Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments 
and Sites of 1964 which was drawn up by conservation professionals to 
provide an international framework for restoration thanks to the efforts of 
UNESCO and the International Council on Monuments and Sites ICOMOS 
In 2005 the Vienna Memorandum named at a conference coorganised by 
UNESCO and the City of Vienna introduced a prominent redefinition of the 
conceptualisation of the historic urban landscape HUL approach Athens was 
a symbol of ancient European values and Venice was a globally recognised 
example of a monumental city threatened by nature However their roles 
as cities were rather passive in the wording of the standards Vienna on the 
other hand contributed actively to the development of the HUL and that of 
the heritage city
This conceptual development reveals complex economic political and social 
changes in many European historic centres and quarters which decreased 
in importance during the deurbanisation process that took place before the 
1970s These historic areas regained significance from the 1980s onwards as 
1 abandoned historic quarters became major touristic destinations 2 rust 
belts became trendy residential areas 3 slumming artisanal quarters became 
innovative venues of creative industries 4 gentrification replaced monument 
protection in many European historic cities where reconstruction of historic 
monuments harshly refuted by the Venice Charter became possible in the 
name of identity politics and of the heritage communities of these historic 
cities and towns 
Memory
If the nineteenth century gave birth to national memories alongside nation
building processes cultivation of national memories remained no less 
important in the twentieth century The new states that emerged after the First 
World War such as Czechoslovakia Hungary or the Baltic states deployed 
an official collective memory to forge national identities which materialised 
in new monuments and memorials names of streets and squares or the 
introduction of new state holidays This undertaking was replicated again 
after the dissolution of the Soviet Union Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia 
in the 1990s as the successor states reinvented their pasts Furthermore
