Phylum Monilophyta Class Polypodiopsida True Ferns
With their large fronds the true ferns are perhaps the most readily recognizable seedless vascular plants They
are also considered to be the most advanced seedless vascular plants and display characteristics commonly
observed in seed plants More than 20000 species of ferns live in environments ranging from the tropics
to temperate forests Although some species survive in dry environments most ferns are restricted to moist
shaded places Ferns made their appearance in the fossil record during the Devonian period 420 MYA and
expanded during the Carboniferous 360 to 300 MYA
The dominant stage of the life cycle of a fern is the sporophyte which consists of large compound leaves called
fronds Fronds may be either finely divided or broadly lobed Fronds fulfill a double role they are photosynthetic
organs that also carry reproductive organs The stem may be buried underground as a rhizome from which
adventitious roots grow to absorb water and nutrients from the soil or they may grow above ground as a trunk
in tree ferns Figure 2521 Adventitious organs are those that grow in unusual places such as roots growing
from the side of a stem

On the underside of each mature fern frond are groups of sporangia called sori Figure 2523a Most ferns
are homosporous Spores are produced by meiosis and are released into the air from the sporangium Those
that land on a suitable substrate germinate and form a heartshaped gametophyte or prothallus which is
attached to the ground by thin filamentous rhizoids Figure 2523b Gametophytes produce both antheridia and
archegonia Like the sperm cells of other pterophytes fern sperm have multiple flagella and must swim to the
archegonium which releases a chemoattractant to guide them The zygote develops into a fern sporophyte
which emerges from the archegonium of the gametophyte Maturation of antheridia and archegonia at different
times encourages crossfertilization The full life cycle of a fern is depicted in Figure 2524
