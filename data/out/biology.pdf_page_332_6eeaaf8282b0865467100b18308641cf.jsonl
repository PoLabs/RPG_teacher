KEY TERMS
lifecycle type in which the diploid and haploid stages alternate
singular chiasma the structure that forms at the crossover points after genetic material is
exchanged
proteins that form a complex that seals sister chromatids together at their centromeres until anaphase
II of meiosis
exchange of genetic material between nonsister chromatids resulting in chromosomes that
incorporate genes from both parents of the organism
union of two haploid cells from two individual organisms
a multicellular haploid lifecycle stage that produces gametes
specialized cell line that produces gametes such as eggs or sperm
also interphase II brief period of rest between meiosis I and meiosis II
the sequence of events in the development of an organism and the production of cells that produce
offspring
a nuclear division process that results in four haploid cells
first round of meiotic cell division referred to as reduction division because the ploidy level is reduced
from diploid to haploid
second round of meiotic cell division following meiosis I sister chromatids are separated into
individual chromosomes and the result is four unique haploid cells
protein assemblies formed on the synaptonemal complex that mark the points of
crossover events and mediate the multistep process of genetic recombination between nonsister
chromatids
nuclear division that produces daughter nuclei each having onehalf as many chromosome
sets as the parental nucleus meiosis I is a reduction division
all the cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells
haploid cell that can produce a haploid multicellular organism or can fuse with another spore to form a
diploid cell
a multicellular diploid lifecycle stage that produces haploid spores by meiosis
formation of a close association between homologous chromosomes during prophase I
protein lattice that forms between homologous chromosomes during prophase I
supporting crossover
two duplicated homologous chromosomes four chromatids bound together by chiasmata during
prophase I
CHAPTER SUMMARY
111 The Process of Meiosis
Sexual reproduction requires that organisms produce cells that can fuse during fertilization to produce
offspring In most animals meiosis is used to produce haploid eggs and sperm from diploid parent cells so that
the fusion of an egg and sperm produces a diploid zygote As with mitosis DNA replication occurs prior to
meiosis during the Sphase of the cell cycle so that each chromosome becomes a pair of sister chromatids In
