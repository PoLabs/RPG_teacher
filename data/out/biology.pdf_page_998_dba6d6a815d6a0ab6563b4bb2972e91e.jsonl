Figure 3219 Shown are the stages of embryo development in the ovule of a shepherds purse Capsella bursa
After fertilization the zygote divides to form an upper terminal cell and a lower basal cell a In the first stage of
development the terminal cell divides forming a globular proembryo The basal cell also divides giving rise to the
suspensor b In the second stage the developing embryo has a heart shape due to the presence of cotyledons c
In the third stage the growing embryo runs out of room and starts to bend d Eventually it completely fills the seed
