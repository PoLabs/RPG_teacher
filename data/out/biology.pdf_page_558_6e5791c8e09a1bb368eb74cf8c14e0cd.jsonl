Choosing the Right Relationships
Imagine being the person responsible for organizing all department store items properlyan overwhelming task
Organizing the evolutionary relationships of all life on Earth proves much more difficult scientists must span
enormous blocks of time and work with information from longextinct organisms Trying to decipher the proper
connections especially given the presence of homologies and analogies makes the task of building an accurate
tree of life extraordinarily difficult Add to that advancing DNA technology which now provides large quantities
of genetic sequences for researchers to use and analzye Taxonomy is a subjective discipline many organisms
have more than one connection to each other so each taxonomist will decide the order of connections
To aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately scientists often use the concept of maximum
parsimony which means that events occurred in the simplest most obvious way For example if a group of
people entered a forest preserve to hike based on the principle of maximum parsimony one could predict that
most would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones
For scientists deciphering evolutionary pathways the same idea is used the pathway of evolution probably
includes the fewest major events that coincide with the evidence at hand Starting with all of the homologous
traits in a group of organisms scientists look for the most obvious and simple order of evolutionary events that
led to the occurrence of those traits

maximum parsimony to create phylogenetic trees
These tools and concepts are only a few strategies scientists use to tackle the task of revealing the
evolutionary history of life on Earth Recently newer technologies have uncovered surprising discoveries with
unexpected relationships such as the fact that people seem to be more closely related to fungi than fungi are
to plants Sound unbelievable As the information about DNA sequences grows scientists will become closer
to mapping the evolutionary history of all life on Earth
203  Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Tree
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe horizontal gene transfer

Illustrate how prokaryotes and eukaryotes transfer genes horizontally

Identify the web and ring models of phylogenetic relationships and describe how they differ from the
original phylogenetic tree concept
Phylogenetic modeling concepts are constantly changing It is one of the most dynamic fields of study in all
biology Over the last several decades new research has challenged scientists ideas about how organisms are
related The scientific community has proposed new models of these relationships
Many phylogenetic trees are models of the evolutionary relationship among species Phylogenetic trees
originated with Charles Darwin who sketched the first phylogenetic tree in 1837 Figure 2012a This served
as a prototype for subsequent studies for more than a century The phylogenetic tree concept with a single trunk
representing a common ancestor with the branches representing the divergence of species from this ancestor
fits well with the structure of many common trees such as the oak Figure 2012b However evidence from
modern DNA sequence analysis and newly developed computer algorithms has caused skepticism about the
standard tree models validity in the scientific community
