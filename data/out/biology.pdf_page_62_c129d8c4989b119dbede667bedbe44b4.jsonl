evaporation of sweat which is 90 percent water allows the organism to cool so that it can maintain homeostasis

Waters Solvent Properties
Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges ions and polar molecules can
readily dissolve in it Therefore we refer to water as a solvent a substance capable of dissolving other polar
molecules and ionic compounds The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with
water surrounding the particle with water molecules We refer to this as a sphere of hydration or a hydration
shell as Figure 215 illustrates and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water
When we add ionic compounds to water the individual ions react with the water molecules polar regions and
their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of
atoms break off from molecules and form ions Consider table salt NaCl or sodium chloride when we add NaCl
crystals to water the NaCl molecules dissociate into Na and Cl ions and spheres of hydration form around
the ions as Figure 215 illustrates The partially negative charge of the water molecules oxygen surrounds the
positively charged sodium ion The hydrogens partially positive charge on the water molecule surrounds the
negatively charged chloride ion
Figure 215 When we mix table salt NaCl in water it forms spheres of hydration around the ions
Waters Cohesive and Adhesive Properties
Have you ever filled a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops Before it overflows
the water forms a domelike shape above the rim of the glass This water can stay above the glass because
of the property of cohesion In cohesion water molecules are attracted to each other because of hydrogen
bonding keeping the molecules together at the liquidgas waterair interface although there is no more room
in the glass
Cohesion allows for surface tension the capacity of a substance to withstand rupturing when placed under
tension or stress This is also why water forms droplets when on a dry surface rather than flattening by gravity
When we place a small scrap of paper onto a water droplet the paper floats on top even though paper is denser
heavier than the water Cohesion and surface tension keep the water molecules hydrogen bonds intact and
support the item floating on the top Its even possible to float a needle on top of a glass of water if you place it
gently without breaking the surface tension as Figure 216 shows
