revolutions An important explanation for their successful mobilisation was 
the fact that they were already organised for other purposes Neighbourhoods 
craft guilds and civic militias all provided frameworks to discuss political 
issues and where necessary to recruit leaders and participants to support 
social and political claimmaking These organisations were moreover 
legitimate parts of the urban system of governance And they subscribed to a 
shared ideology
This ideology was perhaps not very sophisticated but it was persistent and 
could be found in all corners of Europe German historian Heinz Schilling has 
called it urban republicanism A core element in this urban republicanism was 
the idea that all citizens enjoyed fundamental rights and personal liberties On 
this basis it was argued citizens should be consulted by the urban authorities 
before important decisions were taken these authorities represented the civic 
community Some reformed preachers most prominently among them Jean 
Calvin 15091564 moreover argued in the sixteenth century that it was 
acceptable for citizens to rise against unjust governments providing further 
legitimacy to rebellious movements
Rural Rebels Goals and Chronology
Rural societies of the early modern period were never quiet They fought 
against the manorial system opposed the growth of the warfare state and 
contested the diffusion of new agrarian and economic ideas using wide
ranging repertoires of contention Chronologies differ of course from issue 
to issue and from region to region but roughly speaking until the mid
seventeenth century rural societies expressed their opposition in insurrections 
and riots Then because of the success of state violence against them rural 
social movements changed their tactics to legal and illegal resistance 1660
1770 before returning to insurrection and revolts from the 1770s 
In Western Europe the great peasant riots of the fourteenth and fifteenth 
centuries forced the feudal powers to abolish serfdom With the new manorial 
system freeholders could cultivate and acquire land but they were still 
subject to unpaid days of work corves the payment of taxes on agricultural 
production land transactions and the use of collective tools mills for example 
for the benefit of the lords From the seventeenth century the peasants 
resistance to this manorial system often took the form of legal proceedings in 
particular lawsuits If this proved unsuccessful however they could start to 
destroy dovecotes or refuse to pay taxes 
In Central and Eastern Europe the dynamic of the manorial system evolved 
in the opposite direction a free peasantry was reduced to serfdom on the large 
aristocratic estates from the sixteenth century onwards Even if small localised
