over the whole Universe not by its Bulk but by its Power and Virtue him they call the Father 
of all and acknowledge that the beginnings the increase the progress the vicissitudes and 
the end of all things come only from him nor do they offer divine honours to any but to 
him alone And indeed though they differ concerning other things yet all agree in this that 
they think there is one supreme Being that made and governs the World whom they call in 
the Language of their Country Mithras They differ in this that one thinks the God whom 
he worships is this Supreme Being and another thinks that his Idol is that God but they 
all agree in one principle that whatever is this Supreme Being is also that Great Essence 
to whose Glory and Majesty all honours are ascribed by the consent of all Nations pp

What are the key features of Utopian religious belief as described here 
by Hythloday
Hythloday on Utopia as a society commonwealth Thus have I described to you as 
particularly as I could the Constitution of that CommonWealth which I do not only think 
to be the best in the World but to be indeed the only CommonWealth that truly deserves 
that name In all other places it is visible that whereas People talk of a CommonWealth 
every Man only seeks his own Wealth but there where no Man has any Property all Men 
do zealously pursue the good of the Publick and indeed it is no wonder to see Men act 
so differently for in other CommonWealths every Man knows that unless he provides 
for himself how flourishing soever the CommonWealth may be he must die of Hunger 
so that he sees the necessity of preferring his own Concerns to the Publick but in Utopia 
where every Man has a right to everything they do all know that if care is taken to keep the 
Publick Stores full no private Man can want anything for among them there is no unequal 
distribution so that no Man is poor nor in any necessity and though no Man has anything 
yet they are all rich for what can make a Man so rich as to lead a serene and cheerful 
Life free from anxieties neither apprehending want himself nor vexed with the endless 
complaints of his Wife he is not afraid of the misery of his Children nor is he contriving 
how to raise a Portion for his Daughters but is secure in this that both he and his Wife his 
Children and GrandChildren to as many Generations as he can fancy will all live both 
plentifully and happily since among them there is no less care taken of those who were once 
engaged in Labour but grow afterwards unable to follow it than there is elsewhere for these 
that continue still at it pp 197199

Why does Hythloday regard Utopia to be the only CommonWealth 
that truly deserves that name and the best in the World

In what ways might these descriptions of Utopian religion and society 
justify radicalism in practice
The Narrators conclusion  and so taking Hythloday by the hand I carried him to 
supper and told him I would find out some other time for examining that matter more 
particularly and for discoursing more copiously concerning it for which I wish I may find 
a good opportunity In the meanwhile though I cannot perfectly agree to everything that 
was related by Hythloday yet there are many things in the CommonWealth of Utopia that 
I rather wish than hope to see followed in our Governments though it must be confessed 
that he is both a very learned Man and has had a great practice in the World p 206

this concluding sentence
