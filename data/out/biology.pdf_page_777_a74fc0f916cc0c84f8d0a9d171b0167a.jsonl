The Role of Homeobox Hox Genes in Animal Development
Since the early nineteenth century scientists have observed that many animals from the very simple to the
complex shared similar embryonic morphology and development Surprisingly a human embryo and a frog
embryo at a certain stage of embryonic development look remarkably alike For a long time scientists did not
understand why so many animal species looked similar during embryonic development but were very different
as adults They wondered what dictated the developmental direction that a fly mouse frog or human embryo
would take Near the end of the twentieth century a particular class of genes was discovered that had this very
job These genes that determine animal structure are called homeotic genes and they contain DNA sequences
called homeoboxes Genes with homeoboxes encode protein transcription factors One group of animal genes
containing homeobox sequences is specifically referred to as Hox genes This cluster of genes is responsible
for determining the general body plan such as the number of body segments of an animal the number and
placement of appendages and animal headtail directionality The first Hox genes to be sequenced were those
from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster A single Hox mutation in the fruit fly can result in an extra pair
of wings or even legs growing from the head in place of antennae this is because antennae and legs are
embryologic homologous structures and their appearance as antennae or legs is dictated by their origination
within specific body segments of the head and thorax during development Now Hox genes are known from
virtually all other animals as well
