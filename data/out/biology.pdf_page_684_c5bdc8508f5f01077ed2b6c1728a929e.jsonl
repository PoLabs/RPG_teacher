Figure 248 Generalized fungal life cycle Fungi may have both asexual and sexual stages of reproduction
There are many types of asexual spores Conidiospores are unicellular or multicellular spores that are released
directly from the tip or side of the hypha Other asexual spores originate in the fragmentation of a hypha to form
single cells that are released as spores some of these have a thick wall surrounding the fragment Yet others
bud off the vegetative parent cell In contrast to conidiospores sporangiospores are produced directly from a
sporangium Figure 249
Figure 249 Sporangiospores This bright field light micrograph shows the release of spores from a sporangium at the
end of a hypha called a sporangiophore The organism is a Mucor sp fungus a mold often found indoors credit
