The scientific process typically starts with an observation often a problem to solve that leads to a question Lets
think about a simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem
One Monday morning a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm That is an
observation that also describes a problem the classroom is too warm The student then asks a question Why
is the classroom so warm
Proposing a Hypothesis
Recall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that one can test To solve a problem one can propose
several hypotheses For example one hypothesis might be The classroom is warm because no one turned on
the air conditioning However there could be other responses to the question and therefore one may propose
other hypotheses A second hypothesis might be The classroom is warm because there is a power failure and
so the air conditioning doesnt work
Once one has selected a hypothesis the student can make a prediction A prediction is similar to a hypothesis
but it typically has the format If    then     For example the prediction for the first hypothesis might be If
the student turns on the air conditioning then the classroom will no longer be too warm
Testing a Hypothesis
A valid hypothesis must be testable It should also be falsifiable meaning that experimental results can disprove
it Importantly science does not claim to prove anything because scientific understandings are always subject
to modification with further information This stepopenness to disproving ideasis what distinguishes sciences
from nonsciences The presence of the supernatural for instance is neither testable nor falsifiable To test
a hypothesis a researcher will conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the
hypotheses Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls A variable is any part
of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment The control group contains every feature of
the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that the researcher hypothesizes Therefore if
the experimental groups results differ from the control group the difference must be due to the hypothesized
manipulation rather than some outside factor Look for the variables and controls in the examples that follow To
test the first hypothesis the student would find out if the air conditioning is on If the air conditioning is turned
on but does not work there should be another reason and the student should reject this hypothesis To test
the second hypothesis the student could check if the lights in the classroom are functional If so there is no
power failure and the student should reject this hypothesis The students should test each hypothesis by carrying
out appropriate experiments Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not determine whether or not one
can accept the other hypotheses It simply eliminates one hypothesis that is not valid Figure 16 Using the
scientific method the student rejects the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data
