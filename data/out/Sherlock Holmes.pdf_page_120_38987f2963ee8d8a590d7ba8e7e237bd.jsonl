The Adventure of the Engineers Thumb
I think I could lay my nger on it said Holmes
quietly
Really now cried the inspector you have
formed your opinion Come now we shall see who
agrees with you I say it is south for the country is
more deserted there
And I say east said my patient
I am for west remarked the plainclothes man
There are several quiet little villages up there
And I am for north said I because there are no
hills there and our friend says that he did not notice
the carriage go up any
Come cried the inspector laughing its a very
pretty diversity of opinion We have boxed the com
pass among us Who do you give your casting vote
to
You are all wrong
But we cant all be
Oh yes you can This is my point He placed
his nger in the centre of the circle This is where
we shall nd them
But the twelvemile drive gasped Hatherley
Six out and six back Nothing simpler You say
yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when
you got in How could it be that if it had gone twelve
miles over heavy roads
Indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed Brad
street thoughtfully Of course there can be no doubt
as to the nature of this gang
None at all said Holmes They are coiners on
a large scale and have used the machine to form the
amalgam which has taken the place of silver
We have known for some time that a clever gang
was at work said the inspector They have been
turning out halfcrowns by the thousand We even
traced them as far as Reading but could get no farther
for they had covered their traces in a way that showed
that they were very old hands But now thanks to
this lucky chance I think that we have got them right
enough
But the inspector was mistaken for those crimi
nals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice
As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic
column of smoke which streamed up from behind a
small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung
like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape
A house on re asked Bradstreet as the train
steamed off again on its way
Yes sir said the stationmaster
When did it break out
I hear that it was during the night sir but it has
got worse and the whole place is in a blaze
Whose house is it
Dr Bechers
Tell me broke in the engineer is Dr Becher a
German very thin with a long sharp nose
The stationmaster laughed heartily No sir Dr
Becher is an Englishman and there isnt a man in the
parish who has a betterlined waistcoat But he has
a gentleman staying with him a patient as I under
stand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little
good Berkshire beef would do him no harm
The stationmaster had not nished his speech
before we were all hastening in the direction of the
re The road topped a low hill and there was a
great widespread whitewashed building in front of
us spouting re at every chink and window while
in the garden in front three reengines were vainly
striving to keep the ames under
Thats it cried Hatherley in intense excitement
There is the graveldrive and there are the rose
bushes where I lay That second window is the one
that I jumped from
Well at least said Holmes you have had your
revenge upon them There can be no question that it
was your oillamp which when it was crushed in the
press set re to the wooden walls though no doubt
they were too excited in the chase after you to observe
it at the time Now keep your eyes open in this crowd
for your friends of last night though I very much fear
that they are a good hundred miles off by now
And Holmes fears came to be realised for from
that day to this no word has ever been heard either
of the beautiful woman the sinister German or the
morose Englishman Early that morning a peasant
had met a cart containing several people and some
very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of
Reading but there all traces of the fugitives disap
peared and even Holmes ingenuity failed ever to
discover the least clue as to their whereabouts
The remen had been much perturbed at the
strange arrangements which they had found within
and still more so by discovering a newly severed hu
man thumb upon a windowsill of the second oor
About sunset however their efforts were at last suc
cessful and they subdued the ames but not before
the roof had fallen in and the whole place been re
duced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted
cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of
