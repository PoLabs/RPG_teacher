Figure 2923 Amniote skulls Compare the skulls and temporal fenestrae of anapsids synapsids and diapsids
Anapsids have no openings synapsids have one opening and diapsids have two openings
The diapsids in turn diverged into two groups the Archosauromorpha ancient lizard form and the
Lepidosauromorpha scaly lizard form during the Mesozoic period Figure 2924 The lepidosaurs include
modern lizards snakes and tuataras The archosaurs include modern crocodiles and alligators and the extinct
ichthyosaurs fish lizards superficially resembling dolphins pterosaurs winged lizard dinosaurs terrible
lizard and birds We should note that clade Dinosauria includes birds which evolved from a branch of
maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs in the Mesozoic
The evolutionarily derived characteristics of amniotes include the amniotic egg and its four extraembryonic
membranes a thicker and more waterproof skin and rib ventilation of the lungs ventilation is performed by
drawing air into and out of the lungs by muscles such as the costal rib muscles and the diaphragm
Figure 2924 Amniote phylogeny This chart shows the evolution of amniotes The placement of Testudines
turtles is currently still debated
Question Members of the order Testudines have an anapsidlike skull without obvious temporal fenestrae
However molecular studies clearly indicate that turtles descended from a diapsid ancestor Why might this
be the case
In the past the most common division of amniotes has been into the classes Mammalia Reptilia and Aves
However both birds and mammals are descended from different amniote branches the synapsids giving rise to
the therapsids and mammals and the diapsids giving rise to the lepidosaurs and archosaurs We will consider
both the birds and the mammals as groups distinct from reptiles for the purpose of this discussion with the
understanding that this does not accurately reflect phylogenetic history and relationships
