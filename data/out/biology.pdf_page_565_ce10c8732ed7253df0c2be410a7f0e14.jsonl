relationships of life A consequence of the new thinking about phylogenetic models is the idea that Darwins
original phylogenetic tree concept is too simple but made sense based on what scientists knew at the time
However the search for a more useful model moves on each model serves as hypotheses to test with
the possibility of developing new models This is how science advances Researchers use these models as
visualizations to help construct hypothetical evolutionary relationships and understand the massive amount of
data that requires analysis
