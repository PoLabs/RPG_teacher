111  The Process of Meiosis
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis and the differences between the first and second
meiotic divisions

Describe the cellular events that take place during meiosis

Explain the differences between meiosis and mitosis

Explain the mechanisms within the meiotic process that produce genetic variation among the haploid
gametes
Sexual reproduction requires the union of two specialized cells called gametes each of which contains one
set of chromosomes When gametes unite they form a zygote or fertilized egg that contains two sets of
chromosomes Note Cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called haploid cells containing two
sets of chromosomes are called diploid If the reproductive cycle is to continue for any sexually reproducing
species then the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets to produce haploid gametes
otherwise the number of chromosome sets will double with every future round of fertilization Therefore sexual
reproduction requires a nuclear division that reduces the number of chromosome sets by half
Most animals and plants and many unicellular organisms are diploid and therefore have two sets of
chromosomes In each somatic cell of the organism all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or
reproductive cells the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome called homologous chromosomes
Homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing the same genes in identical locations along their
lengths Diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome from each parent
Meiosis is the nuclear division that forms haploid cells from diploid cells and it employs many of the same
cellular mechanisms as mitosis However as you have learned mitosis produces daughter cells whose nuclei
are genetically identical to the original parent nucleus In mitosis both the parent and the daughter nuclei are
at the same ploidy leveldiploid in the case of most multicellular most animals Plants use mitosis to grow as
sporophytes and to grow and produce eggs and sperm as gametophytes so they use mitosis for both haploid
and diploid cells as well as for all other ploidies In meiosis the starting nucleus is always diploid and the
daughter nuclei that result are haploid To achieve this reduction in chromosome number meiosis consists of
one round of chromosome replication followed by two rounds of nuclear division Because the events that occur
during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis the same stage names are assigned
However because there are two rounds of division the major process and the stages are designated with a I
or a II Thus meiosis I is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I prometaphase I and
so on Likewise Meiosis II during which the second round of meiotic division takes place includes prophase II
prometaphase II and so on
Meiosis I
Meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of G1 S and G2 phases which are nearly identical to the
phases preceding mitosis The G1 phase the first gap phase is focused on cell growth During the S
phasethe second phase of interphasethe cell copies or replicates the DNA of the chromosomes Finally in
the G2 phase the second gap phase the cell undergoes the final preparations for meiosis
During DNA duplication in the S phase each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copiessister
chromatids that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins which hold the chromatids together
until anaphase II
Prophase I
Early in prophase I before the chromosomes can be seen clearly with a microscope the homologous
chromosomes are attached at their tips to the nuclear envelope by proteins As the nuclear envelope begins to
break down the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair closer together Recall that
in mitosis homologous chromosomes do not pair together The synaptonemal complex a lattice of proteins
between the homologous chromosomes first forms at specific locations and then spreads outward to cover
the entire length of the chromosomes The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis In
