angels sound asleep in bed Listen to their gentle breathing
Here Michael encouraged by his success breathed so loudly that
they were nearly detected Nana knew that kind of breathing and she
tried to drag herself out of Lizas clutches
But Liza was dense No more of it Nana she said sternly
pulling her out of the room I warn you if you bark again I shall go
straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party
and then oh wont master whip you just
She tied the unhappy dog up again but do you think Nana ceased
to bark Bring master and missus home from the party Why that
was just what she wanted Do you think she cared whether she was
whipped so long as her charges were safe Unfortunately Liza
returned to her puddings and Nana seeing that no help would come
from her strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it
In another moment she had burst into the diningroom of 27 and
flung up her paws to heaven her most expressive way of making a
communication Mr and Mrs Darling knew at once that something
terrible was happening in their nursery and without a goodbye to
their hostess they rushed into the street
But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been
breathing behind the curtains and Peter Pan can do a great deal in
ten minutes
We now return to the nursery
Its all right John announced emerging from his hidingplace
I say Peter can you really fly
Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room
taking the mantelpiece on the way
How topping said John and Michael
How sweet cried Wendy
Yes Im sweet oh I am sweet said Peter forgetting his
manners again
It looked delightfully easy and they tried it first from the floor and
then from the beds but they always went down instead of up
I say how do you do it asked John rubbing his knee He was
quite a practical boy
You just think lovely wonderful thoughts Peter explained and
they lift you up in the air
He showed them again
Youre so nippy at it John said couldnt you do it very slowly
once
Peter did it both slowly and quickly Ive got it now Wendy
cried John but soon he found he had not Not one of them could fly
an inch though even Michael was in words of two syllables and
Peter did not know A from Z
Of course Peter had been trifling with them for no one can fly
unless the fairy dust has been blown on him Fortunately as we have
mentioned one of his hands was messy with it and he blew some on
each of them with the most superb results
Now just wiggle your shoulders this way he said and let go
