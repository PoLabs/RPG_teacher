The Adventure of the Engineers Thumb
the machinery which had cost our unfortunate ac
quaintance so dearly Large masses of nickel and of
tin were discovered stored in an outhouse but no
coins were to be found which may have explained
the presence of those bulky boxes which have been
already referred to
How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed
from the garden to the spot where he recovered his
senses might have remained forever a mystery were
it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain
tale He had evidently been carried down by two per
sons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the
other unusually large ones On the whole it was most
probable that the silent Englishman being less bold
or less murderous than his companion had assisted
the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the
way of danger
Well said our engineer ruefully as we took our
seats to return once more to London it has been a
pretty business for me I have lost my thumb and I
have lost a ftyguinea fee and what have I gained
Experience said Holmes laughing Indirectly
it may be of value you know you have only to put it
into words to gain the reputation of being excellent
company for the remainder of your existence
