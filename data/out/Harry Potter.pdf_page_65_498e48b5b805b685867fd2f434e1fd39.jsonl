silvery eyes were a bit creepy
Your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand Eleven inches
Pliable A little more power and excellent for transfiguration Well I
say your father favored it  its really the wand that chooses the
wizard of course
Mr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to
nose Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes
And thats where
Mr Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harrys forehead with a
long white finger
Im sorry to say I sold the wand that did it he said softly
Thirteenandahalf inches Yew Powerful wand very powerful and in
the wrong hands well if Id known what that wand was going out into
the world to do
He shook his head and then to Harrys relief spotted Hagrid
Rubeus Rubeus Hagrid How nice to see you again Oak sixteen
inches rather bendy wasnt it
It was sir yes said Hagrid
Good wand that one But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got
expelled said Mr Ollivander suddenly stern
Er  yes they did yes said Hagrid shuffling his feet Ive still
got the pieces though he added brightly
But you dont use them said Mr Ollivander sharply
Oh no sit said Hagrid quickly Harry noticed he gripped his pink
umbrella very tightly as he spoke
Hmmm said Mr Ollivander giving Hagrid a piercing look Well now
 Mr Potter Let me see He pulled a long tape measure with silver
markings out of his pocket Which is your wand arm
Er  well Im righthanded said Harry
