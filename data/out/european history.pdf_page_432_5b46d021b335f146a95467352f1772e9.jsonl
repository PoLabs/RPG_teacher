concessions Furthermore authorities had developed patterns of behaviour to 
negotiate with rioters Political riots were to a certain extent a tool for political 
negotiation 
Though violent political protest was far more common than it is today 
nineteenthcentury Europe saw an overall decline in political violence 
instances decreased notably in all European states with the exception of Italy 
On the one hand this was the result of the increasing power of the state and 
its more sophisticated means to curb violent protest On the other hand the 
increasing influence of constitutional activism the rule of law modernised 
bureaucracy and more widespread education opened up nonviolent channels 
to handle political and social conflict
Although there was a general decline in political violence during the century 
this period also saw the birth of terrorism as a political strategy Of course 
political assassinations can be traced back to antiquity Yet around the time 
of the French Revolution a fundamental change in the use of deadly political 
violence against rulers or other persons in positions of power occurred While 
premodern assassinations usually aimed at disposing of and punishing the 
targeted individual as an individual within the existing political framework 
modern terrorism worked differently It aimed to use the emotional and 
political shockwaves of the individual killing to attack the dominant political 
regime and inspire its overthrow Rather than a mere act of killing modern 
terrorism became a form of violent political communication Terrorists hoped 
that through their violence they would provoke an overreaction by the regime 
which in turn would intensify public disgust toward it while drawing public 
sympathies to the insurrectionary cause They also intended to publicly 
highlight the vulnerability of the regime and thus inspire further attacks or 
even open revolt
The birth of modern terrorism was deeply rooted in three larger historical 
developments during the long nineteenth century First terrorists drew on 
the still radiant promises and ideals of the French and American Revolutions 
These promises upheld that liberty and equality could be obtained within 
democratically organised nationstates and that this goal could be reached 
by force if necessary Second terrorist acts were primarily media events The 
revolution of media and transport during the nineteenth century made it 
possible for news stories and even images of violent acts to travel quickly 
through Europe enhancing and expanding their intended political impact and 
inspiring imitators Third the increased capability of modern European states 
to secure the monopoly on violence inspired the strategy behind terrorism 
With the states growing ability to curb violent unrestand the general 
publics decreasing willingness to solve conflict by violent meansradical 
oppositions saw the likelihood of overthrowing regimes through open revolt
