Figure 65 Anabolic pathways are those that require energy to synthesize larger molecules Catabolic pathways are
those that generate energy by breaking down larger molecules Both types of pathways are required for maintaining
the cells energy balance
62  Potential Kinetic Free and Activation Energy
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Define energy

Explain the difference between kinetic and potential energy

Discuss the concepts of free energy and activation energy

Describe endergonic and exergonic reactions
We define energy as the ability to do work As youve learned energy exists in different forms For example
electrical energy light energy and heat energy are all different energy types While these are all familiar energy
types that one can see or feel there is another energy type that is much less tangible Scientists associate this
energy with something as simple as an object above the ground In order to appreciate the way energy flows
into and out of biological systems it is important to understand more about the different energy types that exist
in the physical world
Energy Types
When an object is in motion there is energy For example an airplane in flight produces considerable energy
This is because moving objects are capable of enacting a change or doing work Think of a wrecking ball Even
a slowmoving wrecking ball can do considerable damage to other objects However a wrecking ball that is not
in motion is incapable of performing work Energy with objects in motion is kinetic energy A speeding bullet
a walking person rapid molecule movement in the air which produces heat and electromagnetic radiation like
light all have kinetic energy
What if we lift that same motionless wrecking ball two stories above a car with a crane If the suspended
wrecking ball is unmoving can we associate energy with it The answer is yes The suspended wrecking ball
has associated energy that is fundamentally different from the kinetic energy of objects in motion This energy
form results from the potential for the wrecking ball to do work If we release the ball it would do work Because
this energy type refers to the potential to do work we call it potential energy Objects transfer their energy
between kinetic and potential in the following way As the wrecking ball hangs motionless it has 0 kinetic and
100 percent potential energy Once it releases its kinetic energy begins to increase because it builds speed due
to gravity Simultaneously as it nears the ground it loses potential energy Somewhere midfall it has 50 percent
kinetic and 50 percent potential energy Just before it hits the ground the ball has nearly lost its potential energy
and has nearmaximal kinetic energy Other examples of potential energy include waters energy held behind a
dam Figure 66 or a person about to skydive from an airplane
