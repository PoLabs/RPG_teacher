a
amount of air remaining in the lung after a
maximal exhalation
b
amount of air that the lung holds
c
amount of air that can be further exhaled
after a normal breath
d
amount of air that can be further inhaled
after a normal breath
8 Of the following which does not explain why the
partial pressure of oxygen is lower in the lung than in
the external air
a
Air in the lung is humidified therefore water
vapor pressure alters the pressure
b
Carbon dioxide mixes with oxygen
c
Oxygen is moved into the blood and is
headed to the tissues
d
Lungs exert a pressure on the air to reduce
the oxygen pressure
9 The total lung capacity is calculated using which of
the following formulas
a
residual volume  tidal volume  inspiratory
reserve volume
b
residual volume  expiratory reserve volume
 inspiratory reserve volume
c
expiratory reserve volume  tidal volume 
inspiratory reserve volume
d
residual volume  expiratory reserve volume
 tidal volume  inspiratory reserve volume
10 How would paralysis of the diaphragm alter
inspiration
a
It would prevent contraction of the
intercostal muscles
b
It would prevent inhalation because the
intrapleural pressure would not change
c
It would decrease the intrapleural pressure
and allow more air to enter the lungs
d
It would slow expiration because the lung
would not relax
11 Restrictive airway diseases ________
a
increase the compliance of the lung
b
decrease the compliance of the lung
c
increase the lung volume
d
decrease the work of breathing
12 Alveolar ventilation remains constant when
________
a
the respiratory rate is increased while the
volume of air per breath is decreased
b
the respiratory rate and the volume of air
per breath are increased
c
the respiratory rate is decreased while
increasing the volume per breath
d
both a and c
13 Which of the following will NOT facilitate the
transfer of oxygen to tissues
a
decreased body temperature
b
decreased pH of the blood
c
increased carbon dioxide
d
increased exercise
14 The majority of carbon dioxide in the blood is
transported by ________
a
binding to hemoglobin
b
dissolution in the blood
c
conversion to bicarbonate
d
binding to plasma proteins
15 The majority of oxygen in the blood is transported
by ________
a
dissolution in the blood
b
being carried as bicarbonate ions
c
binding to blood plasma
d
binding to hemoglobin
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
16 Describe the function of these terms and describe
where they are located main bronchus trachea
alveoli and acinus
17 How does the structure of alveoli maximize gas
exchange
18 What does FEV1FVC measure What factors
may affect FEV1FVC
19 What is the reason for having residual volume in
the lung
20 How can a decrease in the percent of oxygen in
the air affect the movement of oxygen in the body
21 If a patient has increased resistance in his or her
lungs how can this be detected by a doctor What
does this mean
22 How would increased airway resistance affect
intrapleural pressure during inhalation
23 Explain how a puncture to the thoracic cavity
from a knife wound for instance could alter the
ability to inhale
24 When someone is standing gravity stretches the
bottom of the lung down toward the floor to a greater
extent than the top of the lung What implication
could this have on the flow of air in the lungs Where
does gas exchange occur in the lungs
25 What would happen if no carbonic anhydrase
were present in red blood cells
26 How does the administration of 100 percent
oxygen save a patient from carbon monoxide
poisoning Why wouldnt giving carbon dioxide work
