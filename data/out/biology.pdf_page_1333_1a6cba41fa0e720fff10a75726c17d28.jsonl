Figure 4222 a As a germline B cell matures an enzyme called DNA recombinase randomly excises V and J
segments from the light chain gene Splicing at the mRNA level results in further gene rearrangement As a result b
each antibody has a unique variable region capable of binding a different antigen
Similar to TCRs and BCRs antibody diversity is produced by the mutation and recombination of approximately
300 different gene segments encoding the light and heavy chain variable domains in precursor cells that are
destined to become B cells The variable domains from the heavy and light chains interact to form the binding
site through which an antibody can bind a specific epitope on an antigen The numbers of repeated constant
domains in Ig classes are the same for all antibodies corresponding to a specific class Antibodies are structurally
similar to the extracellular component of the BCRs and B cell maturation to plasma cells can be visualized in
simple terms as the cell acquires the ability to secrete the extracellular portion of its BCR in large quantities
Antibody Classes
Antibodies can be divided into five classesIgM IgG IgA IgD IgEbased on their physiochemical structural
and immunological properties IgGs which make up about 80 percent of all antibodies have heavy chains that
consist of one variable domain and three identical constant domains IgA and IgD also have three constant
domains per heavy chain whereas IgM and IgE each have four constant domains per heavy chain The variable
domain determines binding specificity and the constant domain of the heavy chain determines the immunological
mechanism of action of the corresponding antibody class It is possible for two antibodies to have the same
binding specificities but be in different classes and therefore to be involved in different functions
After an adaptive defense is produced against a pathogen typically plasma cells first secrete IgM into the blood
