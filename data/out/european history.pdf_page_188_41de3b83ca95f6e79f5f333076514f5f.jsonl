Ethnicity in Early Modern History
From todays point of view ethnicity appears to be a ubiquitous category 
in early modern texts of all genres Contemporaries clearly distinguished 
between Germans Italians French Poles Turks and so on and there was 
considerable fascination with the different languages customs including 
dietary habits national character reputations for ingenuity servility or 
violence for example and styles of dress associated with different peoples 
These interests are amply attested to by ethnographic descriptions included 
in geographical texts travel accounts and missionary reports as well as 
numerous manuscripts and printed costume books Characteristically such 
works mixed firsthand observations to varying degrees with information 
extracted from authoritative ancient and biblical texts Nevertheless for most 
of the early modern period there was no general theory or widely accepted 
concept of ethnicity in the modern sense even as contemporaries freely 
used ethnonyms and grouped individuals into peoples and nations These 
concepts frequently remained ambiguous combining and conflating ethnic 
geographic linguistic and religious identifications while also sometimes 
providing shorthands for describing juridical subjecthood to a given ruler 
such as the King of Spain Ostensibly ethnic terms such as Turk at once 
designated a Muslim and a subject of the Ottoman Sultan The phrase to turn 
Turk found in numerous European languages denoted religious conversion 
to Islam Perhaps unsurprisingly ethnonyms frequently served the purpose 
of constructing the otherness of different communities especially to exclude 
perceived aliens such as Jews and Roma see below
The term nation although used relatively frequently in early modern 
sources did not imply the same degree of ethnic linguistic and political 
homogeneity associated with it from the late eighteenth century onwards see 
Chapter 12 In administrative terms a nation was usually a loose grouping of 
people of similar geographic linguistic and religious background Although 
the Ottoman Empire for instance recognised a French merchant nation under 
the commercial privileges Ottoman Turkish ahdnamei hmayun granted 
to the French king these rules also governed English merchants until 1580 
and thus did not necessarily coincide with political affiliations As practical 
arrangements such privileges regulated the assessment and collection of 
customs duties and taxes as well as the resolution of conflict among merchants 
The shift towards a more systematic distinction of ethnic groups occurred 
only in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with the formulation of 
theories of race Such attempts to establish a scientific categorisation of human 
beings which built on Carl Linnaeuss 17071778 system of taxonomy were 
stimulated by European interactions with the inhabitants of other parts of the
