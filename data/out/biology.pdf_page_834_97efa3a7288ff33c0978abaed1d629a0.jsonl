C elegans The Model System for Linking Developmental Studies
with Genetics
If biologists wanted to research how nicotine dependence develops in the body how lipids are regulated or
observe the attractant or repellant properties of certain odors they would clearly need to design three very
different experiments However they might only need one subject of study Caenorhabditis elegans The
nematode C elegans was brought into the focus of mainstream biological research by Dr Sydney Brenner
Since 1963 Dr Brenner and scientists worldwide have used this animal as a model system to study many
different physiological and developmental mechanisms
C elegans is a freeliving nematode found in soil Only about a millimeter long it can be cultured on agar
plates 10000 wormsplate feeding on the common intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli another long
term resident of biological laboratories worldwide and therefore can be readily grown and maintained in
a laboratory The biggest asset of this nematode is its transparency which helps researchers to observe
and monitor changes within the animal with ease It is also a simple organism with about 1000 cells and
a genome of only 20000 genes Its chromosomes are organized into five pairs of autosomes plus a pair
of sex chromosomes making it an ideal candidate with which to study genetics Since every cell can be
visualized and identified this organism is useful for studying cellular phenomena like celltocell interactions
cellfate determinations cell division apoptosis cell death and intracellular transport
Another tremendous asset is the short life cycle of this worm Figure 2833 It takes only three days
to achieve the egg to adult to daughter egg therefore the developmental consequences of genetic
changes can be quickly identified The total life span of C elegans is two to three weeks hence age
related phenomena are also easy to observe There are two sexes in this species hermaphrodites XX
and males XO However anatomical males are relatively infrequently obtained from matings between
hermaphrodites since their XO chromosome composition requires meiotic nondisjunction when both
parents are XX Another feature that makes C elegans an excellent experimental model is that the position
and number of the 959 cells present in adult hermaphrodites of this organism is constant This feature is
extremely significant when studying cell differentiation celltocell communication and apoptosis Lastly C
elegans is also amenable to genetic manipulations using molecular methods rounding off its usefulness as
a model system
Biologists worldwide have created information banks and groups dedicated to research using C elegans
Their findings have led for example to better understandings of cell communication during development
neuronal signaling and insight into lipid regulation which is important in addressing health issues like the
development of obesity and diabetes In recent years studies have enlightened the medical community
with a better understanding of polycystic kidney disease This simple organism has led biologists to complex
and significant findings growing the field of science in ways that touch the everyday world
Figure 2833 Caenorhabditis elegans a This light micrograph shows the bodies of a group of roundworms
These hermaphrodites consist of exactly 959 cells b The life cycle of C elegans has four juvenile stages L1
through L4 and an adult stage Under ideal conditions the nematode spends a set amount of time at each
juvenile stage but under stressful conditions it may enter a dauer state that does not age significantly and is
somewhat analogous to the diapausing state of some insects credit a modification of work by snickclunkFlickr
