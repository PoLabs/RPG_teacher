1830 the contrast is marked only around 150 history professors in total with 
countries such as Greece Spain and Portugal having no history professorships 
at all The sharp expansion of history professors can be explained not only 
by nineteenthcentury interests in the past but also by taking into account 
the enormous expansion of scientific and scholarly enterprises throughout 
this period At the end of the nineteenth century there were simply many 
more scientists scholars professors and students than at the beginning of the 
century Dutch universities for instance enrolled only 559 students in 1816 
with this number rising to 2816 students in 1900 This growth opened up 
universities to the wider middle class In short educational institutions and 
their personnel grew dramatically in the nineteenth century
The nineteenthcentury expansion in education and knowledge transfer 
manifested itself in more ways than sheer numbers Scientists developed 
new techniques and working methods which significantly increased the 
capacity of science to shape and change the world Medicine for example 
progressed enormously first in its capacity to diagnose illnesses and later
more importantly from a patients perspectivein its ability to cure or 
prevent them This was highly publicised work that found fame for scientists 
such as the German microbiologist Robert Koch 18431910 who managed 
to isolate the bacteria causing anthrax tuberculosis and cholera and his 
French colleague Louis Pasteur whose vaccines for diseases such as anthrax 
and rabies dramatically reduced the mortality rate Pasteurs work is an 
impressive example of the transfer of scientific knowledge to society Socalled 
pasteurisationthe mild heating of foods such as beer milk and wine
improved public health but also led to profound changes in agriculture and 
industry In a similar fashion the second industrial revolution was driven by 
all kinds of scientific often chemical innovations One example is the German 
chemistry professor Justus von Liebig whose name for generations has been 
connected to the canned meat soups and bouillons that were fabricated using 
a procedure developed by him and thus bore his name on the packaging
Industrial food processing vaccines and artificial fertilisers are prime 
examples of the expansion of science into society and industry during the 
nineteenth century But the expansion of the sciences also occurred on a 
global level Scientists made spectacular travels around the globe pushing 
the geographical boundaries of knowledge to map the world further Charles 
Darwins voyage on the ship HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836 which proved 
instrumental in the development of his theory of evolution was just one of 
many nineteenthcentury undertakings to measure land masses and sea depths 
or to identify new species of plants and animals We can additionally speak 
of the polymath Alexander von Humboldt who travelled to the Americas 
and Central Asia and whose writings had a lasting impact on numerous
