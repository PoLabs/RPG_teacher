Introduction
The study of nucleic acids began with the discovery of DNA progressed to the study of genes and small
fragments and has now exploded to the field of genomics Genomics is the study of entire genomes including
the complete set of genes their nucleotide sequence and organization and their interactions within a species
and with other species DNA sequencing technology has contributed to advances in genomics Just as
information technology has led to Google maps that enable people to obtain detailed information about locations
around the globe researchers use genomic information to create similar DNA maps of different organisms
These findings have helped anthropologists to better understand human migration and have aided the medical
field through mapping human genetic diseases Genomic information can contribute to scientific understanding
in various ways and knowledge in the field is quickly growing
