carbohydrates that every organism uses to power its metabolism It is also a source of oxygen necessary for
many living organisms In brief the energy of sunlight is captured to energize electrons whose energy is then
stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules How long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds The
energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and
stored by photosynthesis 350 to 200 million years ago during the Carboniferous Period
Plants algae and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing
photosynthesis Figure 82 Because they use light to manufacture their own food they are called
photoautotrophs literally selffeeders using light Other organisms such as animals fungi and most other
bacteria are termed heterotrophs other feeders because they must rely on the sugars produced by
photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars
not by using sunlights energy but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds For this reason
they are referred to as chemoautotrophs
Figure 82 Photoautotrophs including a plants b algae and c cyanobacteria synthesize their organic compounds
via photosynthesis using sunlight as an energy source Cyanobacteria and planktonic algae can grow over enormous
areas in water at times completely covering the surface In a d deep sea vent chemoautotrophs such as these
e thermophilic bacteria capture energy from inorganic compounds to produce organic compounds The ecosystem
surrounding the vents has a diverse array of animals such as tubeworms crustaceans and octopuses that derive
energy from the bacteria credit a modification of work by Steve Hillebrand US Fish and Wildlife Service credit b

The importance of photosynthesis is not just that it can capture sunlights energy After all a lizard sunning itself
on a cold day can use the suns energy to warm up in a process called behavioral thermoregulation In contrast
photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way to store the energy from solar radiation the photo part to
energy in the carboncarbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules the synthesis part Those carbohydrates are
the energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of ATP via respiration Therefore photosynthesis
powers 99 percent of Earths ecosystems When a top predator such as a wolf preys on a deer Figure 83
the wolf is at the end of an energy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun to visible light
to photosynthesis to vegetation to deer and finally to the wolf
