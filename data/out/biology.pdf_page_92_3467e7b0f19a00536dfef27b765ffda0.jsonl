Figure 314 Stearic acid is a common saturated fatty acid
When the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond the fatty acid is unsaturated Oleic acid is an example of
an unsaturated fatty acid Figure 315
Figure 315 Oleic acid is a common unsaturated fatty acid
Most unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature We call these oils If there is one double bond in the
molecule then it is a monounsaturated fat eg olive oil and if there is more than one double bond then it is a
polyunsaturated fat eg canola oil
When a fatty acid has no double bonds it is a saturated fatty acid because it is not possible to add more
hydrogen to the chains carbon atoms A fat may contain similar or different fatty acids attached to glycerol Long
straight fatty acids with single bonds generally pack tightly and are solid at room temperature Animal fats with
stearic acid and palmitic acid common in meat and the fat with butyric acid common in butter are examples
of saturated fats Mammals store fats in specialized cells or adipocytes where fat globules occupy most of
the cells volume Plants store fat or oil in many seeds and use them as a source of energy during seedling
development Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain cis unsaturated fatty acids Cis
and trans indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond If hydrogens are present in the
same plane it is a cis fat If the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes it is a trans fat The cis double
bond causes a bend or a kink that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly keeping them liquid at room
temperature Figure 316 Olive oil corn oil canola oil and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats
Unsaturated fats help to lower blood cholesterol levels whereas saturated fats contribute to plaque formation in
the arteries
