Figure 3818 The patella of the knee is an example of a sesamoid bone
Sutural bones are small flat irregularly shaped bones They may be found between the flat bones of the skull
They vary in number shape size and position
Bone Tissue
Bones are considered organs because they contain various types of tissue such as blood connective tissue
nerves and bone tissue Osteocytes the living cells of bone tissue form the mineral matrix of bones There are
two types of bone tissue compact and spongy
Compact Bone Tissue
Compact bone or cortical bone forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary
cavity or bone marrow It provides protection and strength to bones Compact bone tissue consists of units
called osteons or Haversian systems Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living
osteocytes connected by canaliculi which transport blood They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone
Each osteon consists of lamellae which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the
Haversian canal The Haversian canal osteonic canal contains the bones blood vessels and nerve fibers
Figure 3819 Osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along lines of stress and help
the bone resist bending or fracturing Therefore compact bone tissue is prominent in areas of bone at which
stresses are applied in only a few directions
