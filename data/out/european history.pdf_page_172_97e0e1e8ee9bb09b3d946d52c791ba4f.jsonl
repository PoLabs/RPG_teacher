and famine The Industrial Revolution was at an early phase when in 1798 
Malthus wrote 
A man who is born into a world already possessed if he cannot get subsistence from his 
parents on whom he has a just demand and if the society do not want his labour has no 
claim of right to the smallest portion of food and in fact has no business to be where he is 
At natures mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him
These are cruel words but the world at the time was even more cruel More 
people started to survive but they were starving lacking resources and 
pauperised Few were born welloff and few could easily find their place in 
the world of the early industrial revolution 
Nevertheless the world had changed significantly by the dawn of the 
twentieth century Demographically Europe was a forerunner and its 
nineteenth century saw an escape from hunger and premature death in the 
words of Nobel Prize laureate Robert Fogel 19262013 Increasingly people 
started surviving beyond childhood and the oldest in society grew older as 
well As a result populations grew rapidly even though fertility also started 
to decrease As it became evident that populations had escaped from this 
Malthusian trap European states started to value population growth sizable 
healthy populations meant a stronger military and economic presence The 
stage was set for a new era even though the demographic developments were 
not immediately noticeable for everyone in society
