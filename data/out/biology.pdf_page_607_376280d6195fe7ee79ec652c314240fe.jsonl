Figure 2211 The three domains of living organisms Bacteria and Archaea are both prokaryotes but differ enough to
be placed in separate domains An ancestor of modern Archaea is believed to have given rise to Eukarya the third
domain of life Major groups of Archaea and Bacteria are shown
Characteristics of bacterial phyla are described in Figure 2212 and Figure 2213 Major bacterial phyla
include the Proteobacteria the Chlamydias the Spirochaetes the photosynthetic Cyanobacteria and the
Grampositive bacteria The Proteobacteria are in turn subdivided into several classes from the Alpha to the
Epsilon proteobacteria Eukaryotic mitochondria are thought to be the descendants of alphaproteobacteria while
eukaryotic chloroplasts are derived from cyanobacteria Archaeal phyla are described in Figure 2214
