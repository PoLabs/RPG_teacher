41 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
447
nineteenthcentury technologies As the long century progressed torpedoes 
rapidfiring weapons personal defence weapons and poison gases greatly 
improved the capacity of humans to kill each other in huge numbers aviation 
still in its beginnings would soon take part in this mortal enterprise Weapons 
and the war material successfully conquered the world not only in the hands 
of European and American colonisers but also in those of othersrulers 
and rebels all over the world who bought adapted produced or used these 
armaments
Not all novelties were as striking as the steam engine but many brought 
with them revolutionary changes too from the spinning mule of the first 
Industrial Revolution to the industrial applications of modern chemistry in 
the second Sewing machines made it possible for many women to earn a 
decent living from home while bicycles facilitated the everyday mobility of 
hundreds of thousands of Europeans Daguerreotype and photography made 
it possible even for poorer people to have their loved ones immortalised A 
German migrant to Buenos Aires could send a postcard with a panoramic view 
of the city to the family she left behind Mass production of goods whether 
or not they were accompanied by technological improvements made many 
luxury commodities iron tools boots china furniture more affordable for 
urban and rural dwellers in Europe and beyond Technological changes and 
the reorganisation of production in factories combined with the widespread 
discourse of freedom equality and usefulness together had collateral impact 
on the rise of labour movements and workingclass identities
Technological change has often been represented as the work of geniuses 
It has also often been understood as derived from scientific knowledge 
Regarding the first of the two ideas the nineteenth century is largely at fault 
Men like James Watt George Stephenson Nikola Tesla Thomas A Edison 
Guglielmo Marconi or the Lumire brothers embodied the notion of a bright 
inventor with great efficiency However many of their innovations were in 
fact the collective works of many people and were improved and adapted 
as they circulated around the world Regarding the second idea the links 
between technology and science were much more fluid and less unidirectional 
than is often imagined Many nineteenthcentury inventions were not based 
on a scientific understanding of the principles of their operation nor were 
they derived from research Many of the people who invented or improved 
machines tools or procedures had little scientific knowledge It is true 
though that these links became more solid and organised towards the end 
of the century and that efforts were made to institutionalise the cooperation 
between scientific research and industry The blurred frontiers between the 
old and the new between science and technology between knowledge and 
skills were evident in for example the coexistence of the patent system with
