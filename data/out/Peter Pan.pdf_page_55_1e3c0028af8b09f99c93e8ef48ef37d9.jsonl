heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in
the world the mermaids calling to the moon
Peter was not quite like other boys but he was afraid at last A
tremour ran through him like a shudder passing over the sea but on
the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them
and Peter felt just the one Next moment he was standing erect on the
rock again with that smile on his face and a drum beating within
him It was saying To die will be an awfully big adventure
