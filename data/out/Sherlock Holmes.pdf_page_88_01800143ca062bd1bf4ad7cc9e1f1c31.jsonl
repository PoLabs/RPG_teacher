The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle
proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely
and could therefore hardly be in the best of training
But his wifeyou said that she had ceased to
love him
This hat has not been brushed for weeks When I
see you my dear Watson with a weeks accumulation
of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows
you to go out in such a state I shall fear that you
also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes
affection
But he might be a bachelor
Nay he was bringing home the goose as a peace
offering to his wife Remember the card upon the
birds leg
You have an answer to everything But how on
earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his
house
One tallow stain or even two might come by
chance but when I see no less than ve I think that
there can be little doubt that the individual must
be brought into frequent contact with burning tal
lowwalks upstairs at night probably with his hat in
one hand and a guttering candle in the other Any
how he never got tallowstains from a gasjet Are
you satised
Well it is very ingenious said I laughing but
since as you said just now there has been no crime
committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose
all this seems to be rather a waste of energy
Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply
when the door ew open and Peterson the com
missionaire rushed into the apartment with ushed
cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with as
tonishment
The goose Mr Holmes
The goose sir he
gasped
Eh What of it then Has it returned to life and
apped off through the kitchen window Holmes
twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer
view of the mans excited face
See here sir See what my wife found in its crop
He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre
of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone rather
smaller than a bean in size but of such purity and
radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the
dark hollow of his hand
Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle By Jove
Peterson said he this is treasure trove indeed I
suppose you know what you have got
A diamond sir A precious stone It cuts into
glass as though it were putty
Its more than a precious stone It is the precious
stone
Not the Countess of Morcars blue carbuncle I
ejaculated
Precisely so I ought to know its size and shape
seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in
The Times every day lately It is absolutely unique
and its value can only be conjectured but the reward
offered of 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth
part of the market price
A thousand pounds
Great Lord of mercy
The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and
stared from one to the other of us
That is the reward and I have reason to know
that there are sentimental considerations in the back
ground which would induce the Countess to part with
half her fortune if she could but recover the gem
It was lost if I remember aright at the Hotel
Cosmopolitan I remarked
Precisely so on December 22nd just ve days
ago John Horner a plumber was accused of hav
ing abstracted it from the ladys jewelcase The ev
idence against him was so strong that the case has
been referred to the Assizes I have some account
of the matter here I believe He rummaged amid
his newspapers glancing over the dates until at last
he smoothed one out doubled it over and read the
following paragraph
Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery
John
Horner 26 plumber was brought up upon
the charge of having upon the 22nd inst ab
stracted from the jewelcase of the Countess of
Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue
carbuncle James Ryder upperattendant at
the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that
he had shown Horner up to the dressingroom
of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the
robbery in order that he might solder the sec
ond bar of the grate which was loose
He
had remained with Horner some little time
but had nally been called away On return
ing he found that Horner had disappeared
that the bureau had been forced open and
that the small morocco casket in which as it
afterwards transpired the Countess was ac
customed to keep her jewel was lying empty
upon the dressingtable Ryder instantly gave
the alarm and Horner was arrested the same
