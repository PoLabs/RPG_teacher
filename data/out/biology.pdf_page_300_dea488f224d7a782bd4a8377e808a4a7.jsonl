There is also variation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle When rapidly dividing
mammalian cells are grown in a culture outside the body under optimal growing conditions the length of
the cell cycle is about 24 hours In rapidly dividing human cells with a 24hour cell cycle the G1 phase lasts
approximately nine hours the S phase lasts 10 hours the G2 phase lasts about four and onehalf hours and the
M phase lasts approximately onehalf hour By comparison in fertilized eggs and early embryos of fruit flies
the cell cycle is completed in about eight minutes This is because the nucleus of the fertilized egg divides many
times by mitosis but does not go through cytokinesis until a multinucleate zygote has been produced with
many nuclei located along the periphery of the cell membrane thereby shortening the time of the cell division
cycle The timing of events in the cell cycle of both invertebrates and vertebrates is controlled by mechanisms
that are both internal and external to the cell
Regulation of the Cell Cycle by External Events
Both the initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events external to the cell when it is about to
begin the replication process An event may be as simple as the death of nearby cells or as sweeping as the
release of growthpromoting hormones such as human growth hormone HGH or hGH A lack of HGH can
inhibit cell division resulting in dwarfism whereas too much HGH can result in gigantism Crowding of cells can
also inhibit cell division In contrast a factor that can initiate cell division is the size of the cell As a cell grows it
becomes physiologically inefficient due to its decreasing surfacetovolume ratio The solution to this problem is
to divide
Whatever the source of the message the cell receives the signal and a series of events within the cell allows it
to proceed into interphase Moving forward from this initiation point every parameter required during each cell
cycle phase must be met or the cycle cannot progress
Regulation at Internal Checkpoints
It is essential that the daughter cells produced be exact duplicates of the parent cell Mistakes in the duplication
or distribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced
from an abnormal cell To prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide there are internal control
mechanisms that operate at three main cellcycle checkpoints A checkpoint is one of several points in the
eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of a cell to the next stage in the cycle can be halted until conditions
are favorable These checkpoints occur near the end of G1 at the G2M transition and during metaphase
