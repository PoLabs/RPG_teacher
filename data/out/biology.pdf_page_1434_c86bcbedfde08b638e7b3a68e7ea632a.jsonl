By the time they reach adulthood they must develop skills to compete for natural resources In plants scientists
think of parental care more broadly how long fruit takes to develop or how long it remains on the plant are
determining factors in the time to the next reproductive event Examples of Kselected species are primates
including humans elephants and plants such as oak trees Figure 4513a
Oak trees grow very slowly and take on average 20 years to produce their first seeds known as acorns As
many as 50000 acorns can be produced by an individual tree but the germination rate is low as many of these
rot or are eaten by animals such as squirrels In some years oaks may produce an exceptionally large number
of acorns and these years may be on a two or threeyear cycle depending on the species of oak rselection
As oak trees grow to a large size and for many years before they begin to produce acorns they devote a
large percentage of their energy budget to growth and maintenance The trees height and size allow it to
dominate other plants in the competition for sunlight the oaks primary energy resource Furthermore when it
does reproduce the oak produces large energyrich seeds that use their energy reserve to become quickly
established Kselection
In contrast rselected species have a large number of small offspring hence their r designation Table 452
This strategy is often employed in unpredictable or changing environments Animals that are rselected do
not give longterm parental care and the offspring are relatively mature and selfsufficient at birth Examples
of rselected species are marine invertebrates such as jellyfish and plants such as the dandelion Figure
4513b Dandelions have small seeds that are wind dispersed long distances Many seeds are produced
simultaneously to ensure that at least some of them reach a hospitable environment Seeds that land in
inhospitable environments have little chance for survival since their seeds are low in energy content Note that
survival is not necessarily a function of energy stored in the seed itself
