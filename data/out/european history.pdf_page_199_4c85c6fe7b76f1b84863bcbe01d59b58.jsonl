seen as a particularly effective tool for transforming domestic populations 
into modern nations The task of schools was among other things to raise 
good citizens and instil patriotic feelings in children Therefore educational 
systems were centralised in the course of the nineteenth century and state 
languages assumed an increasingly dominant role in schools at the expense of 
minority languages In 1880 for example a nationally uniform school system 
was introduced in France which left little or no room for regional languages 
However even in countries with one dominant official language a 
diversity of dialects prevailed local languages survived and significant ethnic 
minorities or nationalities continued to exist The United Kingdom officially 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1801 is a case in point 
despite the common language it has never become a nationstate per se In 
nineteenthcentury Britain the Irish Welsh Scots and smaller ethnic groups 
lived alongside the English and maintained their separate identities These 
nations were all peoples of Celtic origin descendants of the population that 
had lived on the British Isles since before the AngloSaxon conquest 
Several members of those communities continued to use their own 
languages although their struggles to ensure the survival of their native 
tongues were fought with varying degrees of success In Ireland Wales and 
Scotland for example the native Gaelic languages had long lost their primacy 
by the nineteenth century and either bilingualism or the exclusive use of the 
English language had become the dominant pattern 
In nineteenthcentury Spain centralising tendencies followed the French 
model in many respects The historic rights of significant minorities like the 
Basques were gradually suspended throughout the late eighteenth century 
and the nineteenth and Spanish was declared to be the main language of the 
state Nonetheless regional cultural identities such as that of the Basques 
Catalans and Gallegos proved to be strong enough to withstand the Spanish 
monarchys centralising ambitions and their languages survived transforming 
into modern languages during the nineteenth century
In countries that achieved unification in the second half of the nineteenth 
century like Italy in 1861 or Germany in 1871 common language and common 
cultural heritage were regarded as the chief unifying factors However strong 
dialectal differences and regional identities survived in these countries thanks 
to centuries of territorial and political separation It was to some extent a matter 
of decision which dialect should become the basis of standard German and 
standard Italian and thus the language of state administration the judiciary 
middle and higher education literature and the press and dialects continued 
to be spoken locally at work in public in informal social situations and in 
families On the other hand both modern Italy and Germany were conceived 
as nationstates and at least in Germany there was perceptible pressure on 
minoritiessuch as the Poles in the eastern provincesto assimilate
