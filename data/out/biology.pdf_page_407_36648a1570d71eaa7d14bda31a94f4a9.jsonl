Telomerase and Aging
Cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened because most somatic cells do not
make telomerase This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging With the advent
of modern medicine preventative health care and healthier lifestyles the human life span has increased and
there is an increasing demand for people to look younger and have a better quality of life as they grow older
In 2010 scientists found that telomerase can reverse some agerelated conditions in mice This may have
potential in regenerative medicine

Telomerasedeficient mice were used in these studies these mice have
tissue atrophy stem cell depletion organ system failure and impaired tissue injury responses Telomerase
reactivation in these mice caused extension of telomeres reduced DNA damage reversed neurodegeneration
and improved the function of the testes spleen and intestines Thus telomere reactivation may have potential
for treating agerelated diseases in humans
Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells The cells accumulate mutations
proliferate uncontrollably and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis
Scientists have observed that cancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is
active in these cells Interestingly only after the telomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase
become active If the action of telomerase in these cells can be inhibited by drugs during cancer therapy then
the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped from further division
146  DNA Repair
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the different types of mutations in DNA

Explain DNA repair mechanisms
DNA replication is a highly accurate process but mistakes can occasionally occur such as a DNA polymerase
inserting a wrong base Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences such as cancer
Repair mechanisms correct the mistakes In rare cases mistakes are not corrected leading to mutations in
other cases repair enzymes are themselves mutated or defective
Most of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by the proofreading ability of DNA
polymerase itself Figure 1417 In proofreading the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding
the next one so a correction can be made The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired
correctly with the base in the template strand If it is the right base the next nucleotide is added If an incorrect
base has been added the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester bond and releases the wrong nucleotide
This is performed by the 3 exonuclease action of DNA pol Once the incorrect nucleotide has been removed it
