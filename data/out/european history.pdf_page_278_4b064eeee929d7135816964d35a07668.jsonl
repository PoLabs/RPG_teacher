in civil wars Immigrants performed the lowestpaid jobs and very often did 
not have easy access to citizenship a condition that was coupled with social 
prejudices against poor foreigners However collective discrimination was 
and remains more active when immigrants do not come from Christian 
countries and when they have external traits colour of skin type of hair that 
can be used as the basis of their racialisation For this reason the last wave of 
immigration that started in the 1990s with many immigrants coming from the 
old European colonial empires has fostered a widespread rise in xenophobic 
attitudes reflected in the rise of ultraright political parties
Ethnic and racial groups have not been the only ones to be treated unequally 
by European societies The position of chronically ill or disabled persons was 
subject to contradictory trends in the twentieth century From the First World 
War and especially after the Second World War families and religious or lay 
charities were partially supplanted by public centres and pensions This led 
to the homogenisation of treatments and longterm improvements in medical 
and psychiatric care However until the 1970s and 1980s this often resulted 
in new biopolitical measures that implied total or partial confinement and 
even the application of eugenic policies Even though Nazi policies discredited 
eugenics some countries like Norway and Sweden maintained the norms of 
the interwar period to legalise eugenic sterilisation It was only in the 1980s 
that a new social sensitivity towards people with disabilities started to 
emerge eugenic policies disappeared integration became the general social 
aim and confinement started to be seen as an extreme solution The results 
of the new views on disabilities were curtailed though by the stagnation or 
deconstruction of welfare institutions and policies that have characterised the 
evolution of most European countries since the 1980s 
Conclusion
In conclusion inequality as a concept and as lived experience has shifted 
considerably in the course of the twentieth century It has been a century of 
rapid technological change dramatic patterns of migration chronic political 
crisis death and destruction on a mass scale but also a period of remarkable 
social mobility Many of the most obvious inequalities in terms of class race 
and gender were addressed even if the full realisation of equality remains 
elusive What has remained consistent has been the focus of the left from 
communism to social democracy on inequalities In contrast the right from 
fascism to conservatism has advocated the idea of a meritocracy or embraced 
traditional hierarchies
