researchers have suggested that a gammaray burst caused by a nearby supernova was a possible cause of
the OrdovicianSilurian extinction The gammaray burst would have stripped away the Earths protective ozone
layer allowing intense ultraviolet radiation from the sun to reach the surface of the earthand may account
for climate changes observed at the time The hypothesis is very speculative and extraterrestrial influences on
Earths history are an active line of research Recovery of biodiversity after the mass extinction took from 5 to 20
million years depending on the location
The late Devonian extinction may have occurred over a relatively long period of time It appears to have mostly
affected marine species and not so much the plants or animals inhabiting terrestrial habitats The causes of this
extinction are poorly understood
The endPermian extinction was the largest in the history of life Indeed an argument could be made that
Earth became nearly devoid of life during this extinction event Estimates are that 96 percent of all marine
species and 70 percent of all terrestrial species were lost It was at this time for example that the trilobites a
group that survived the OrdovicianSilurian extinction became extinct The causes for this mass extinction are
not clear but the leading suspect is extended and widespread volcanic activity that led to a runaway global
warming event The oceans became largely anoxic suffocating marine life Terrestrial tetrapod diversity took 30
million years to recover after the endPermian extinction The Permian extinction dramatically altered Earths
biodiversity makeup and the course of evolution
The causes of the TriassicJurassic extinction event are not clear and researchers argue hypotheses including
climate change asteroid impact and volcanic eruptions The extinction event occurred just before the breakup
of the supercontinent Pangaea although recent scholarship suggests that the extinctions may have occurred
more gradually throughout the Triassic
The causes of the endCretaceous extinction event are the ones that are best understood It was during this
extinction event about 65 million years ago that the majority of the dinosaurs the dominant vertebrate group for
millions of years disappeared from the planet with the exception of a theropod clade that gave rise to birds
The cause of this extinction is now understood to be the result of a cataclysmic impact of a large meteorite
or asteroid off the coast of what is now the Yucatn Peninsula This hypothesis proposed first in 1980 was a
radical explanation based on a sharp spike in the levels of iridium which enters our atmosphere from meteors
at a fairly constant rate but is otherwise absent on Earths surface in the rock stratum that marks the boundary
between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods Figure 476 This boundary marked the disappearance of the
dinosaurs in fossils as well as many other taxa The researchers who discovered the iridium spike interpreted it
as a rapid influx of iridium from space to the atmosphere in the form of a large asteroid rather than a slowing
in the deposition of sediments during that period It was a radical explanation but the report of an appropriately
aged and sized impact crater in 1991 made the hypothesis more believable Now an abundance of geological
evidence supports the theory Recovery times for biodiversity after the endCretaceous extinction are shorter in
geological time than for the endPermian extinction on the order of 10 million years
Another possibility perhaps coincidental with the impact of the Yucatan asteroid was extensive volcanism that
began forming about 66 million years ago about the same time as the Yucatan asteroid impact at the end of
the Cretaceous The lava flows covered over 50 percent of what is now India The release of volcanic gases
particularly sulphur dioxide during the formation of the traps contributed to climate change which may have
induced the mass extinction
