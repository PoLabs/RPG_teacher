huntingground Yet her face was impassive she was the daughter of
a chief she must die as a chiefs daughter it is enough
They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her
mouth No watch was kept on the ship it being Hooks boast that the
wind of his name guarded the ship for a mile around Now her fate
would help to guard it also One more wail would go the round in
that wind by night
In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not
see the rock till they crashed into it
Luff you lubber cried an Irish voice that was Smees heres
the rock Now then what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to
it and leave her here to drown
It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on
the rock she was too proud to offer a vain resistance
Quite near the rock but out of sight two heads were bobbing up
and down Peters and Wendys Wendy was crying for it was the
first tragedy she had seen Peter had seen many tragedies but he had
forgotten them all He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily it
was two against one that angered him and he meant to save her An
easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had gone but he
was never one to choose the easy way
There was almost nothing he could not do and he now imitated
the voice of Hook
Ahoy there you lubbers he called It was a marvellous
imitation
The captain said the pirates staring at each other in surprise
He must be swimming out to us Starkey said when they had
looked for him in vain
We are putting the redskin on the rock Smee called out
Set her free came the astonishing answer
Free
Yes cut her bonds and let her go
But captain
At once dye hear cried Peter or Ill plunge my hook in you
This is queer Smee gasped
Better do what the captain orders said Starkey nervously
Ay ay Smee said and he cut Tiger Lilys cords At once like an
eel she slid between Starkeys legs into the water
Of course Wendy was very elated over Peters cleverness but she
knew that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus
betray himself so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth But
it was stayed even in the act for Boat ahoy rang over the lagoon
in Hooks voice and this time it was not Peter who had spoken
Peter may have been about to crow but his face puckered in a
whistle of surprise instead
Boat ahoy again came the voice
Now Wendy understood The real Hook was also in the water
He was swimming to the boat and as his men showed a light to
guide him he had soon reached them In the light of the lantern
