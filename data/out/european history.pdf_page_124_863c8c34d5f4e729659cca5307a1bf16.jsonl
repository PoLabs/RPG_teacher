notary of the expedition led to Brazil by the Portuguese commander Pedro 
lvares Cabral 146714681520 The French philosopher and essayist Michel 
de Montaigne 15331592 famously described the indigenous people as 
virtuous and noble savages comparing descriptions of ritual cannibalism 
in Brazil to the barbarous torture of religious opponents in sixteenthcentury 
France But depictions of indigenous people in the Americas were not always 
favourable Descriptions of the elaborate Inca and Aztec civilisations and their 
court ceremonial blend an appreciation of certain aspects of those cultures with 
a more general sense of suspicion and harsh critiques of their religious rites 
Missionaries hoping to bring Christianity to these newly discovered peoples 
often commented negatively on what they considered to be their resilient 
paganism in the face of the true religion as well as their inherent evilness 
which often encoded negative images of sexual practices Descriptions of the

paradisiac stereotypes or stressed the idea of wilderness in the Americas
Power and Otherness
European descriptions and ideas of nonEuropean others were the product 
of reallife interaction conquest colonisation trade exploitation and military 
confrontation But these perceptions and debates also determined how these 
human groups were treated and the kinds of relationships that Europeans 
established with them In numerous areas of the world Europeans were not 
able to disrupt completely the previous social and political structures and acted 
for many decades as participants and gobetweens within existing economic 
and political systems whose rules they themselves had not established But 
in other parts of the world particularly in the Americas and through the 
enslavement of African populations disruption was substantial and lethal The 
American population was decimated by Eurasian diseases such as smallpox 
measles and many others Partly to replace these population losses around 
86 million enslaved people from different parts of the African continent were 
forced to work on plantations in the Americas between 1500 and 1800 	
There were intense theological moral and juridical debates about the 
status and nature of human beings throughout the early modern period In the 
Spanish dominions forceful denunciations of the illtreatment of indigenous 
peoples in the Americas sometimes prompted new laws and measures aimed 
at regulating and controlling these abuses The theologian and jurist Francisco 
de Vitoria 14831546 rebutted most of the legal arguments as well as papal 
donations and imperial ideologies which supported the Spanish claims
