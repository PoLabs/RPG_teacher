Global Decline of Coral Reefs
It takes many thousands of years to build a coral reef The animals that create coral reefs have evolved
over millions of years continuing to slowly deposit the calcium carbonate that forms their characteristic
ocean homes Bathed in warm tropical waters the coral animals and their symbiotic algal partners evolved
to survive at the upper limit of ocean water temperature
Together climate change and human activity pose dual threats to the longterm survival of the worlds
coral reefs As global warming due to fossil fuel emissions raises ocean temperatures coral reefs are
suffering The excessive warmth causes the reefs to lose their symbiotic foodproducing algae resulting
in a phenomenon known as bleaching When bleaching occurs the reefs lose much of their characteristic
color as the algae and the coral animals die if loss of the symbiotic zooxanthellae is prolonged
Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide further threaten the corals in other ways as CO2 dissolves
in ocean waters it lowers the pH and increases ocean acidity As acidity increases it interferes with the
calcification that normally occurs when coral animals build their calcium carbonate shelters
When a coral reef begins to die species diversity plummets as animals lose food and shelter Coral reefs
are also economically important tourist destinations so the decline of coral reefs poses a serious threat to
coastal economies
Human population growth has damaged corals in other ways too As human coastal populations increase
the runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals has increased as well causing some of the onceclear
tropical waters to become cloudy At the same time overfishing of popular fish species has allowed the
predator species that eat corals to go unchecked
Although a rise in global temperatures of 12 C a conservative scientific projection in the coming decades
may not seem large it is very significant to this biome When change occurs rapidly species can become
extinct before evolution can offer new adaptations Many scientists believe that global warming with its rapid
in terms of evolutionary time and inexorable increases in temperature is tipping the balance beyond the
point at which many of the worlds coral reefs can recover
Estuaries Where the Ocean Meets Fresh Water
Estuaries are biomes that occur where a source of fresh water such as a river meets the ocean Therefore
both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity mixing results in a diluted brackish saltwater
Estuaries form protected areas where many of the young offspring of crustaceans molluscs and fish begin their
lives which also creates important breeding grounds for other animals Salinity is a very important factor that
influences the organisms and the adaptations of the organisms found in estuaries The salinity of estuaries varies
considerably and is based on the rate of flow of its freshwater sources which may depend on the seasonal
rainfall Once or twice a day high tides bring salt water into the estuary Low tides occurring at the same
frequency reverse the current of salt water
The shortterm and rapid variation in salinity due to the mixing of fresh water and salt water is a difficult
physiological challenge for the plants and animals that inhabit estuaries Many estuarine plant species are
halophytes plants that can tolerate salty conditions Halophytic plants are adapted to deal with the salinity
resulting from saltwater on their roots or from sea spray In some halophytes filters in the roots remove the salt
from the water that the plant absorbs Other plants are able to pump oxygen into their roots Animals such as
mussels and clams phylum Mollusca have developed behavioral adaptations that expend a lot of energy to
function in this rapidly changing environment When these animals are exposed to low salinity they stop feeding
close their shells and switch from aerobic respiration in which they use gills to remove oxygen from the water
to anaerobic respiration a process that does not require oxygen and takes place in the cytoplasm of the animals
cells When high tide returns to the estuary the salinity and oxygen content of the water increases and these
animals open their shells begin feeding and return to aerobic respiration
Freshwater Biomes
Freshwater biomes include lakes and ponds standing water as well as rivers and streams flowing water They
