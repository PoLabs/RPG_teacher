A Scandal in Bohemia
We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at
the door He was searching his pockets for the key
when someone passing said
Goodnight Mister Sherlock Holmes
There were several people on the pavement at the
time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim
youth in an ulster who had hurried by
Ive heard that voice before said Holmes star
ing down the dimly lit street Now I wonder who
the deuce that could have been
CHAPTER III
I slept at Baker Street that night and we were
engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning
when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room
You have really got it he cried grasping Sher
lock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly
into his face
Not yet
But you have hopes
I have hopes
Then come I am all impatience to be gone
We must have a cab
No my brougham is waiting
Then that will simplify matters We descended
and started off once more for Briony Lodge
Irene Adler is married remarked Holmes
Married When
Yesterday
But to whom
To an English lawyer named Norton
But she could not love him
I am in hopes that she does
And why in hopes
Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of
future annoyance If the lady loves her husband she
does not love your Majesty If she does not love your
Majesty there is no reason why she should interfere
with your Majestys plan
It is true And yetWell I wish she had been
of my own station What a queen she would have
made He relapsed into a moody silence which was
not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue
The door of Briony Lodge was open and an el
derly woman stood upon the steps She watched us
with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham
Mr Sherlock Holmes I believe said she
I am Mr Holmes answered my companion
looking at her with a questioning and rather startled
gaze
Indeed My mistress told me that you were likely
to call She left this morning with her husband by the
515 train from Charing Cross for the Continent
What Sherlock Holmes staggered back white
with chagrin and surprise Do you mean that she
has left England
Never to return
And the papers asked the King hoarsely All
is lost
We shall see He pushed past the servant and
rushed into the drawingroom followed by the King
and myself The furniture was scattered about in
every direction with dismantled shelves and open
drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them
before her ight Holmes rushed at the bellpull tore
back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his
hand pulled out a photograph and a letter The pho
tograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress
the letter was superscribed to Sherlock Holmes Esq
To be left till called for My friend tore it open and
we all three read it together It was dated at midnight
of the preceding night and ran in this way
