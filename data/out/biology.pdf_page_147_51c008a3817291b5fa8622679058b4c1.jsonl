through a lens system to visualize a specimen
organelle in an animal cell that functions as the cells digestive component it breaks down proteins
polysaccharides lipids nucleic acids and even wornout organelles
the cytoskeleton systems narrowest element it provides rigidity and shape to the cell and
enables cellular movements
an instrument that magnifies an object
the cytoskeleton systems widest element it helps the cell resist compression provides a track
along which vesicles move through the cell pulls replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing
cell and is the structural element of centrioles flagella and cilia
singular  mitochondrion cellular organelles responsible for carrying out cellular respiration
resulting in producing ATP the cells main energycarrying molecule
doublemembrane structure that constitutes the nucleus outermost portion
central part of a prokaryotic cells central part where the chromosome is located
darkly staining body within the nucleus that is responsible for assembling ribosome subunits
semisolid fluid inside the nucleus that contains the chromatin and nucleolus
cell organelle that houses the cells DNA and directs ribosome and protein synthesis
compartment or sac within a cell
small round organelle that contains hydrogen peroxide oxidizes fatty acids and amino acids and
detoxifies many poisons
phospholipid bilayer with embedded integral or attached peripheral proteins and
separates the cells internal content from its surrounding environment
plural  plasmodesmata channel that passes between adjacent plant cells cell walls connects
their cytoplasm and allows transporting of materials from cell to cell
unicellular organism that lacks a nucleus or any other membranebound organelle
cellular structure that carries out protein synthesis
region of the endoplasmic reticulum that is studded with ribosomes and
engages in protein modification and phospholipid synthesis
region of the endoplasmic reticulum that has few or no ribosomes on
its cytoplasmic surface and synthesizes carbohydrates lipids and steroid hormones detoxifies certain
chemicals like pesticides preservatives medications and environmental pollutants and stores calcium
ions
protein adherence that creates a firm seal between two adjacent animal cells
a biological concept that states that one or more cells comprise all organisms the cell is the
basic unit of life and new cells arise from existing cells
membranebound sac somewhat larger than a vesicle which functions in cellular storage and
transport
small membranebound sac that functions in cellular storage and transport its membrane is capable of
fusing with the plasma membrane and the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus
