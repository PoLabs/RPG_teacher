were the earliest vertebrates with jawless species being the earliest forms and jawed species evolving later
They are active feeders rather than sessile suspension feeders The Agnatha jawless fishesthe hagfishes
and lampreyshave a distinct cranium and complex sense organs including eyes that distinguish them from
the invertebrate chordates the urochordates and cephalochordates
Jawless Fishes Superclass Agnatha
Jawless fishes Agnatha are craniates representing an ancient vertebrate lineage that arose over 550 million
years ago In the past hagfishes and lampreys were sometimes recognized as separate clades within the
Agnatha primarily because lampreys were regarded as true vertebrates whereas hagfishes were not However
recent molecular data both from rRNA and mtDNA as well as embryological data provide strong support for
the hypothesis that living agnathanspreviously called cyclostomesare monophyletic and thus share recent
common ancestry The discussion below for convenience separates the modern cyclostomes into the class
Myxini and class Petromyzontida The defining features of the living jawless fishes are the lack of jaws and
lack of paired lateral appendages fins They also lack internal ossification and scales although these are not
defining features of the clade
Some of the earliest jawless fishes were the armored ostracoderms which translates to shellskin vertebrate
fishes encased in bony armorunlike presentday jawless fishes which lack bone in their scales Some
ostracoderms also unlike living jawless fishes may have had paired fins We should note however that the
ostracoderms represent an assemblage of heavily armored extinct jawless fishes that may not form a natural
evolutionary group Fossils of the genus Haikouichthys from China with an age of about 530 million years show
many typical vertebrate characteristics including paired eyes auditory capsules and rudimentary vertebrae
Class Myxini Hagfishes
The class Myxini includes at least 70 species of hagfisheseellike scavengers that live on the ocean floor
and feed on living or dead invertebrates fishes and marine mammals Figure 299 Although they are almost
completely blind sensory barbels around the mouth help them locate food by smell and touch They feed using
keratinized teeth on a movable cartilaginous plate in the mouth which rasp pieces of flesh from their prey These
feeding structures allow the gills to be used exclusively for respiration not for filter feeding as in the urochordates
and cephalochordates Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in oceans around the world except for
the polar regions Unique slime glands beneath the skin release a milky mucus through surface pores that
upon contact with water becomes incredibly slippery making the animal almost impossible to hold This slippery
mucus thus allows the hagfish to escape from the grip of predators Hagfish can also twist their bodies into a
knot which provides additional leverage to feed Sometimes hagfish enter the bodies of dead animals and eat
carcasses from the inside out Interestingly they do not have a stomach

Hagfishes have a cartilaginous skull as well as a fibrous and cartilaginous skeleton but the major supportive
structure is the notochord that runs the length of the body In hagfishes the notochord is not replaced by the
vertebral column as it is in true vertebrates and thus they may morphologically represent a sister group to the
true vertebrates making them the most basal clade among the skullbearing chordates
