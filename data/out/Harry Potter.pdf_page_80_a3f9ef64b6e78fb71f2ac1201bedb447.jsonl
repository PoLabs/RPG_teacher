80
While they had been talking the train had carried them out of London
Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep They were
quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick past
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the
corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said
Anything off the cart dears
Harry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet but Rons ears
went pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches Harry went
out into the corridor
He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys and now that he
had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many
Mars Bars as he could carry  but the woman didnt have Mars Bars What
she did have were Bettie Botts Every Flavor Beans Droobles Best
Blowing Gum Chocolate Frogs Pumpkin Pasties Cauldron Cakes Licorice
Wands and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his
life Not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid
the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped
it onto an empty seat
Hungry are you
Starving said Harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it There were four
sandwiches inside He pulled one of them apart and said She always
forgets I dont like corned beef
Swap you for one of these said Harry holding up a pasty Go on 
You dont want this its all dry said Ron She hasnt got much
time he added quickly you know with five of us
Go on have a pasty said Harry who had never had anything to share
before or indeed anyone to share it with It was a nice feeling
sitting there with Ron eating their way through all Harrys pasties
cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten
