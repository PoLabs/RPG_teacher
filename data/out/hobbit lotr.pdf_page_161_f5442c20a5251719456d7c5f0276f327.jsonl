In the meanwhile the Woodelves had gone back up the Forest River with their
cargoes and there was great excitement in the kings palace I have never heard
what happened to the chief of the guards and the butler Nothing of course was
ever said about keys or barrels while the dwarves stayed in Laketown and
Bilbo was careful never to become invisible Still I daresay more was guessed
than was known though doubtless Mr Baggins remained a bit of a mystery In
any case the king knew now the dwarves errand or thought he did and he said
to himself
Very well Well see No treasure will come back through Mirkwood
without my having something to say in the matter But I expect they will all
come to a bad end and serve them right He at any rate did not believe in
dwarves fighting and killing dragons like Smaug and he strongly suspected
attempted burglary or something like itwhich shows he was a wise elf and
wiser than the men of the town though not quite right as we shall see in the end
He sent out his spies about the shores of the lake and as far northward towards
the Mountain as they would go and waited
At the end of a fortnight Thorin began to think of departure While the
enthusiasm still lasted in the town was the time to get help It would not do to let
everything cool down with delay So he spoke to the Master and his councillors
and said that soon he and his company must go on towards the Mountain
Then for the first time the Master was surprised and a little frightened and he
wondered if Thorin was after all really a descendant of the old kings He had
never thought that the dwarves would actually dare to approach Smaug but
believed they were frauds who would sooner or later be discovered and be
turned out He was wrong Thorin of course was really the grandson of the
King under the Mountain and there is no knowing what a dwarf will not dare
and do for revenge or the recovery of his own
But the Master was not sorry at all to let them go They were expensive to
keep and their arrival had turned things into a long holiday in which business
was at a standstill Let them go and bother Smaug and see how he welcomes
them he thought Certainly O Thorin Thrains son Thrors son was what he
said You must claim your own The hour is at hand spoken of old What help
we can offer shall be yours and we trust to your gratitude when your kingdom is
regained
So one day although autumn was now getting far on and winds were cold
and leaves were falling fast three large boats left Laketown laden with rowers
dwarves Mr Baggins and many provisions Horses and ponies had been sent
