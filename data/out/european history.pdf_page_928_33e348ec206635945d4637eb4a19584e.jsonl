Throughout the twentieth century one answer to this question was offering 
people the opportunity to go on holiday The workers right to holiday was 
first made possible by the extension of the welfare state which gradually 
came to include paid holidays In 1936 France established two weeks of paid 
holiday In Great Britain a weeks holiday became available in 1938 Thanks to 
the regulation of working hours and modern means of transportationsuch 
as the railway and later the car and the planethe twentieth century saw the 
gradual evolution of tourism from a unique activity for the elite to a set of 
practices involving wider circles 
The same evolution occurred in sport During the nineteenth century 
the aristocracy was the social class with the greatest access to sport and the 
most popular sports were activities like horse riding Nonaristocratic classes 
had access to sport as a form of pastime that became established over time 
through for example the establishment of football matches related to political 
associations or trade unions In the case of dance culture dancing had long been 
organised along the lines of social class In the twentieth century by contrast 
it became an integral part of urban nightlife with people from diverse social 
backgrounds crossing paths and all doing the same popular dances  
The increase in free time and the development of new leisure activities 
were conceived as modern These changes were not only made possible by 
modernisation processes such as the development of new forms of transport 
they also offered people a way to make sense of the new epoch in which they 
were living In other words it allowed them to experience and cope with the 
fastchanging society of the twentieth century
On the one hand this development of more free time and more leisure 
activities could be seen as a progressive development it was exciting to engage 
with leisure activities related to new technological developments gender 
emancipation and urbanisation On the other hand the development of free 
time could also serve as a reminder of constraint and discipline How much 
freedom people actually enjoyed in their free time is debatable For many 
people engaging in these activities functioned as a way to escape from a fast
paced and depersonalised modern society which was perceived as alienating 
and overwhelming In addition leisure time was controlled and mediated 
by different entities such as governments states sporting associations and 
social organisations or NGOs These groups managed to limit when where 
and how society could spend its free time and even in some cases prescribed 
how individuals could move their bodies As the century went on people 
internalised this regulation of leisure time and bodily control and aimed for 
selfregulation in their leisure activities 
In sum modern sport and leisure can simultaneously be understood 
as an experience of freedom and a practice of constraint In this respect
