Figure 339 Simple columnar epithelial cells absorb material from the digestive tract Goblet cells secret mucous into
the digestive tract lumen
Columnar epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract appear to be stratified However each cell is attached to the
base membrane of the tissue and therefore they are simple tissues The nuclei are arranged at different levels
in the layer of cells making it appear as though there is more than one layer as seen in Figure 3310 This
is called pseudostratified columnar epithelia This cellular covering has cilia at the apical or free surface of
the cells The cilia enhance the movement of mucous and trapped particles out of the respiratory tract helping
to protect the system from invasive microorganisms and harmful material that has been breathed into the body
Goblet cells are interspersed in some tissues such as the lining of the trachea The goblet cells contain mucous
that traps irritants which in the case of the trachea keep these irritants from getting into the lungs
Figure 3310 Pseudostratified columnar epithelia line the respiratory tract They exist in one layer but the arrangement
of nuclei at different levels makes it appear that there is more than one layer Goblet cells interspersed between the
columnar epithelial cells secrete mucous into the respiratory tract
Transitional Epithelia
Transitional or uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system primarily in the bladder and ureter These
cells are arranged in a stratified layer but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in
a relaxed empty bladder as illustrated in Figure 3311 As the urinary bladder fills the epithelial layer unfolds
and expands to hold the volume of urine introduced into it As the bladder fills it expands and the lining becomes
thinner In other words the tissue transitions from thick to thin
