33  Lipids
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the four major types of lipids

Explain the role of fats in storing energy

Differentiate between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids

Describe phospholipids and their role in cells

Define the basic structure of a steroid and some steroid functions

Explain how cholesterol helps maintain the plasma membranes fluid nature
Lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature This is because they are
hydrocarbons that include mostly nonpolar carboncarbon or carbonhydrogen bonds Nonpolar molecules are
hydrophobic water fearing or insoluble in water Lipids perform many different functions in a cell Cells store
energy for longterm use in the form of fats Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and
animals Figure 312 For example they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry when forming a protective
layer over fur or feathers because of their waterrepellant hydrophobic nature Lipids are also the building blocks
of many hormones and are an important constituent of all cellular membranes Lipids include fats oils waxes
phospholipids and steroids

Fats and Oils
A fat molecule consists of two main componentsglycerol and fatty acids Glycerol is an organic compound
alcohol with three carbons five hydrogens and three hydroxyl OH groups Fatty acids have a long chain of
hydrocarbons to which a carboxyl group is attached hence the name fatty acid The number of carbons in the
fatty acid may range from 4 to 36 The most common are those containing 1218 carbons In a fat molecule the
fatty acids attach to each of the glycerol molecules three carbons with an ester bond through an oxygen atom
