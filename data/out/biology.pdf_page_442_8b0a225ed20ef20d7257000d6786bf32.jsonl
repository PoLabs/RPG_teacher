152 Prokaryotic Transcription
In prokaryotes mRNA synthesis is initiated at a promoter sequence on the DNA template comprising two
consensus sequences that recruit RNA polymerase The prokaryotic polymerase consists of a core enzyme of
four protein subunits and a  protein that assists only with initiation Elongation synthesizes mRNA in the 5 to
3 direction at a rate of 40 nucleotides per second Termination liberates the mRNA and occurs either by rho
protein interaction or by the formation of an mRNA hairpin
153 Eukaryotic Transcription
Transcription in eukaryotes involves one of three types of polymerases depending on the gene being
transcribed RNA polymerase II transcribes all of the proteincoding genes whereas RNA polymerase I
transcribes the tandemly duplicated rRNA genes and RNA polymerase III transcribes various small RNAs like
the 5S rRNA tRNA and small nuclear RNA genes The initiation of transcription in eukaryotes involves the
binding of several transcription factors to complex promoter sequences that are usually located upstream of the
gene being copied The mRNA is synthesized in the 5 to 3 direction and the FACT complex moves and
reassembles nucleosomes as the polymerase passes by Whereas RNA polymerases I and III terminate
transcription by protein or RNA hairpindependent methods RNA polymerase II transcribes for 1000 or more
nucleotides beyond the gene template and cleaves the excess during premRNA processing
154 RNA Processing in Eukaryotes
Eukaryotic premRNAs are modified with a 5 methylguanosine cap and a polyA tail These structures protect
the mature mRNA from degradation and help export it from the nucleus PremRNAs also undergo splicing in
which introns are removed and exons are reconnected with singlenucleotide accuracy Only finished mRNAs
that have undergone 5 capping 3 polyadenylation and intron splicing are exported from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm PrerRNAs and pretRNAs may be processed by intramolecular cleavage splicing methylation and
chemical conversion of nucleotides Rarely RNA editing is also performed to insert missing bases after an
mRNA has been synthesized
155 Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis
The players in translation include the mRNA template ribosomes tRNAs and various enzymatic factors The
small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA template either at the ShineDalgarno sequence prokaryotes or
the 5 cap eukaryotes Translation begins at the initiating AUG on the mRNA specifying methionine The
formation of peptide bonds occurs between sequential amino acids matched to the mRNA template by their
tRNAs according to the genetic code Charged tRNAs enter the ribosomal A site and their amino acid bonds
with the amino acid at the P site The entire mRNA is translated in threenucleotide steps of the ribosome
When a nonsense codon is encountered a release factor binds and dissociates the components and frees the
new protein Folding of the protein occurs during and after translation
