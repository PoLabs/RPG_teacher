America the extinctions of almost all of the large mammals occurred 1000012000 years ago All that are left
are the smaller mammals such as bears elk moose and cougars Finally on many remote oceanic islands the
extinctions of many species occurred coincidentally with human arrivals Not all of the islands had large animals
but when there were large animals they were often forced into extinction Madagascar was colonized about
2000 years ago and the large mammals that lived there became extinct Eurasia and Africa do not show this
pattern but they also did not experience a recent arrival of huntergatherer humans Rather humans arrived in
Eurasia hundreds of thousands of years ago This topic remains an area of active research and hypothesizing
It seems clear that even if climate played a role in most cases human hunting precipitated the extinctions
Recent Extinctions
The sixth or Holocene mass extinction appears to have begun earlier than previously believed and is largely
due to the disruptive activities of modern Homo sapiens Since the beginning of the Holocene period there
are numerous recent extinctions of individual species that are recorded in human writings Most of these are
coincident with the expansion of the European colonies since the 1500s
One of the earlier and popularly known examples is the dodo bird The odd pigeonlike bird lived in the forests of
Mauritius an island in the Indian Ocean and became extinct around 1662 The dodo was hunted for its meat by
sailors and was easy prey because it approached people without fear the dodo had not evolved with humans
Pigs rats and dogs brought to the island by European ships also killed dodo young and eggs
Stellers sea cow became extinct in 1768 it was related to the manatee and probably once lived along the
northwest coast of North America Stellers sea cow was first discovered by Europeans in 1741 and was
overhunted for meat and oil The last sea cow was killed in 1768 That amounts to just 27 years between the sea
cows first contact with Europeans and extinction of the species
Since 1900 a variety of species have gone extinct including the following

In 1914 the last living passenger pigeon died in a zoo in Cincinnati Ohio This species had once darkened
the skies of North America during its migrations but it was overhunted and suffered from habitat loss that
resulted from the clearing of forests for farmland

The Carolina parakeet once common in the eastern United States died out in 1918 It suffered habitat loss
and was hunted to prevent it from eating orchard fruit The parakeet ate orchard fruit because its native
foods were destroyed to make way for farmland

The Japanese sea lion which inhabited a broad area around Japan and the coast of Korea became extinct
in the 1950s due to fishermen

The Caribbean monk seal was distributed throughout the Caribbean Sea but was driven to extinction via
hunting by 1952
These are only a few of the recorded extinctions in the past 500 years The International Union for Conservation
of Nature IUCN keeps a list of extinct and endangered species called the Red List The list is not complete
but it describes 380 extinct species of vertebrates after 1500 AD 86 of which were driven extinct by overhunting
or overfishing
Estimates of PresentTime Extinction Rates
Estimates of extinction rates are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without
observation The extinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans especially if it has been hunted
or used in some other way But there are many organisms that are of less interest to humans not necessarily of
less value and many that are undescribed
The background extinction rate is estimated to be about one per million species per year EMSY For
example assuming there are about ten million species in existence the expectation is that ten species would
become extinct each year each year represents ten million species per year
One contemporary extinction rate estimate uses the extinctions in the written record since the year 1500 For
birds alone this method yields an estimate of 26 EMSY However this value may be an underestimate for three
reasons First many species would not have been described until much later in the time period so their loss
would have gone unnoticed Second the number of recently extinct vertebrate species is increasing because
extinct species now are being described from skeletal remains And third some species are probably already
extinct even though conservationists are reluctant to name them as such Taking these factors into account
raises the estimated extinction rate closer to 100 EMSY The predicted rate by the end of the century is 1500 E
MSY
A second approach to estimating presenttime extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by
