As you can see a good CRM strategy turns

friends and friends into advocates for your 
business One needs to identify the right touch
points and messaging to drive a customer 
further along this funnel
154 UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMERS
Customers should be seen as the most important stakeholders in a business Without customers 
purchasing goods or services most businesses would not have a revenue stream It can be 
difficult to shift from realising this important fact to implementing it in daytoday business 
decisions and strategies 
A successful relationship with a customer is based on meeting or even exceeding their needs 
You need to establish what problems the customer has and provide solutions sometimes 
before the problem occurs You also have to continually give the customer a reason to transact 
with your company above any other
CRM should not only mean implementing customercentric processes and consider technology 
but embracing customerdriven processes Through innovations in digital technologies 
enhanced customer engagement social listening and the introduction of mass personalisation 
the customer can often drive the business 
Figure 152 A customercentred approach keeps the 
customer as the focus of all business activities 
1541 Consumer touchpoints

needs to speak with one voice across all of 
these touchpoints and deliver a rewarding and relevant experience every time it interacts with

model
NOTE
A good CRM infrastructure must ensure 
touchpoints for dialogue
