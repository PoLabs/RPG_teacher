during the fiddlehead or crozier stage bracken secretes nutritious sugary and proteinaceous compounds from
special nectaries that attract ants and even species of jumping spiders all of which defend the plants croziers
until they are fully unfolded These opportunistic groups of protective arthropods greatly reduce the damage that
otherwise would occur during the early stages of growth
Animals and Plants Pollination
Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small feathery and visually inconspicuous Grasses are a successful
group of flowering plants that are wind pollinated They produce large amounts of powdery pollen carried over
large distances by the wind Some large trees such as oaks maples and birches are also wind pollinated

More than 80 percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination technically the transfer of pollen from
the anther to the stigma Consequently plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators With
over 200000 different plants dependent on animal pollination the plant needs to advertise to its pollinators with
some specificity The specificity of specialized plant structures that target animals can be very surprising It is
possible for example to determine the general type of pollinators favored by a plant by observing the flowers
physical characteristics Many bird or insectpollinated flowers secrete nectar which is a sugary liquid They
also produce both fertile pollen for reproduction and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for birds and insects Many
butterflies and bees can detect ultraviolet light and flowers that attract these pollinators usually display a pattern
of ultraviolet reflectance that helps them quickly locate the flowers center In this manner pollinating insects
collect nectar while at the same time are dusted with pollen Figure 2621 Large red flowers with little smell and
a long funnel shape are preferred by hummingbirds who have good color perception a poor sense of smell and
need a strong perch White flowers that open at night attract moths Other animalssuch as bats lemurs and
lizardscan also act as pollinating agents Any disruption to these interactions such as the disappearance of
bees for example as a consequence of colony collapse disorders can lead to disaster for agricultural industries
that depend heavily on pollinated crops
