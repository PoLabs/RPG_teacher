391  Systems of Gas Exchange
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the passage of air from the outside environment to the lungs

Explain how the lungs are protected from particulate matter
The primary function of the respiratory system is to deliver oxygen to the cells of the bodys tissues and remove
carbon dioxide a cell waste product The main structures of the human respiratory system are the nasal cavity
the trachea and lungs
All aerobic organisms require oxygen to carry out their metabolic functions Along the evolutionary tree
different organisms have devised different means of obtaining oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere The
environment in which the animal lives greatly determines how an animal respires The complexity of the
respiratory system is correlated with the size of the organism As animal size increases diffusion distances
increase and the ratio of surface area to volume drops In unicellular organisms diffusion across the cell
membrane is sufficient for supplying oxygen to the cell Figure 392 Diffusion is a slow passive transport
process In order for diffusion to be a feasible means of providing oxygen to the cell the rate of oxygen uptake
must match the rate of diffusion across the membrane In other words if the cell were very large or thick
diffusion would not be able to provide oxygen quickly enough to the inside of the cell Therefore dependence
on diffusion as a means of obtaining oxygen and removing carbon dioxide remains feasible only for small
organisms or those with highlyflattened bodies such as many flatworms Platyhelminthes Larger organisms
had to evolve specialized respiratory tissues such as gills lungs and respiratory passages accompanied by
complex circulatory systems to transport oxygen throughout their entire body
Figure 392 The cell of the unicellular alga Ventricaria ventricosa is one of the largest known reaching one to five
centimeters in diameter Like all singlecelled organisms V ventricosa exchanges gases across the cell membrane
Direct Diffusion
For small multicellular organisms diffusion across the outer membrane is sufficient to meet their oxygen needs
Gas exchange by direct diffusion across surface membranes is efficient for organisms less than 1 mm in
diameter In simple organisms such as cnidarians and flatworms every cell in the body is close to the external
environment Their cells are kept moist and gases diffuse quickly via direct diffusion Flatworms are small
literally flat worms which breathe through diffusion across the outer membrane Figure 393 The flat shape of
these organisms increases the surface area for diffusion ensuring that each cell within the body is close to the
outer membrane surface and has access to oxygen If the flatworm had a cylindrical body then the cells in the
center would not be able to get oxygen
