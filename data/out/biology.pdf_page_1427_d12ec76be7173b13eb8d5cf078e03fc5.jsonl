453  Environmental Limits to Population Growth
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain the characteristics of and differences between exponential and logistic growth patterns

Give examples of exponential and logistic growth in natural populations

Describe how natural selection and environmental adaptation led to the evolution of particular life history
patterns
Although life histories describe the way many characteristics of a population such as their age structure change
over time in a general way population ecologists make use of a variety of methods to model population dynamics
mathematically These more precise models can then be used to accurately describe changes occurring in a
population and better predict future changes Certain longaccepted models are now being modified or even
abandoned due to their lack of predictive ability and scholars strive to create effective new models
Exponential Growth
Charles Darwin in his theory of natural selection was greatly influenced by the English clergyman Thomas
Malthus Malthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very
rapidly and then population growth decreases as resources become depleted This accelerating pattern of
increasing population size is called exponential growth
The best example of exponential growth is seen in bacteria Bacteria reproduce by prokaryotic fission This
division takes about an hour for many bacterial species If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an
unlimited supply of nutrients so the nutrients will not become depleted after an hour there is one round of
division and each organism divides resulting in 2000 organismsan increase of 1000 In another hour each
of the 2000 organisms will double producing 4000 an increase of 2000 organisms After the third hour there
should be 8000 bacteria in the flask an increase of 4000 organisms The important concept of exponential
growth is the accelerating population growth ratethe number of organisms added in each reproductive
generationthat is it is increasing at a greater and greater rate After 1 day and 24 of these cycles the
population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion When the population size N is plotted over
time a Jshaped growth curve is produced Figure 459
The bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited Furthermore some
bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce lowering the growth rate Therefore when
calculating the growth rate of a population the death rate D number organisms that die during a particular
time interval is subtracted from the birth rate B number organisms that are born during that interval This is
shown in the following formula
N change in number
T change in time   B birth rate  D death rate
The birth rate is usually expressed on a per capita for each individual basis Thus B birth rate  bN the per
capita birth rate b multiplied by the number of individuals N and D death rate  dN the per capita death
rate d multiplied by the number of individuals N Additionally ecologists are interested in the population at a
particular point in time an infinitely small time interval For this reason the terminology of differential calculus is
used to obtain the instantaneous growth rate replacing the change in number and time with an instantspecific
measurement of number and time
dN
dT   bN  dN  b   dN
Notice that the d associated with the first term refers to the derivative as the term is used in calculus and is
different from the death rate also called d The difference between birth and death rates is further simplified by
substituting the term r intrinsic rate of increase for the relationship between birth and death rates
dN
dT   rN
The value r can be positive meaning the population is increasing in size or negative meaning the population
