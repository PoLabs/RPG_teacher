How to Use a Genome Map Viewer
Problem statement Do the human macaque and mouse genomes contain common DNA sequences
Develop a hypothesis
To test the hypothesis click this link httpwwwncbinlmnihgovmapview 
In Search box on the left panel type any gene name or phenotypic characteristic such as iris pigmentation
eye color Select the species you want to study and then press Enter The genome map viewer will
indicate which chromosome encodes the gene in your search Click each hit in the genome viewer for more
detailed information This type of search is the most basic use of the genome viewer You can also use it to
compare sequences between species as well as many other complicated tasks
Is the hypothesis correct Why or why not
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man OMIM is a searchable online catalog of human genes and genetic
disorders This website shows genome mapping information and also details the history and research of
each trait and disorder Click this link httpopenstaxcollegeorglOMIM to search for traits such as
handedness and genetic disorders such as diabetes
173  WholeGenome Sequencing
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe three types of sequencing

Define wholegenome sequencing
Although there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years doctors are still
confounded by some diseases and they are using wholegenome sequencing to discover the root of the
problem Wholegenome sequencing is a process that determines an entire genomes DNA sequence Whole
genome sequencing is a bruteforce approach to problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a
disease Several laboratories now provide services to sequence analyze and interpret entire genomes
For example wholeexome sequencing is a lowercost alternative to whole genome sequencing In exome
sequencing the doctor sequences only the DNAs coding exonproducing regions In 2010 doctors used
wholeexome sequencing to save a young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses The child
had several colon operations with no relief Finally they performed wholeexome sequencing which revealed
a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis programmed cell death The doctors used a bonemarrow
transplant to overcome this genetic disorder leading to a cure for the boy He was the first person to receive
successful treatment based on a wholeexome sequencing diagnosis Today human genome sequencing is
more readily available and results are available within two days for about 1000
Strategies Used in Sequencing Projects
The basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method
also known as the dideoxy method which Fred Sanger developed in the 1970s The chain termination method
involves DNA replication of a singlestranded template by using a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide
