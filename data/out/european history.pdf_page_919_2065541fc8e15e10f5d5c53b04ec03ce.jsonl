Paris and the New Experience of Leisure
In the process of defining leisure and using it as a tool to reshape social 
hierarchies cities played a key role More than any other city Paris embodied 
the transformation of leisure practices in Europe in the nineteenth century 
and constituted a model that both fascinated and provoked imitation The 
ambivalent image of Paris as a capital of pleasure dates back to the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries but it became more prominent in the nineteenth 
century This idea of Paris as a capital of pleasure was developed in the travel 
guides that were published from the 1830s onwardstravel guides from 
Baedeker Conti or Joannewhich offered an organised catalogue of places 
itineraries schedules and activities to experience le gai Paris 
Time and leisure in Paris were organised around the cityscape and the 
public spaces created for the enjoyment of urban life Urban developments 
that had been taking shape since the seventeenth century were accelerated in 
the second half of the nineteenth century when Napoleon III returned from 
his British exile with the idea of making Paris a festive and monumental capital 
adorned with green spaces a project of reconstruction that was undertaken 
by Baron GeorgesEugne Haussmann 18091891 and engineer Adolphe 
Alphand 18171891 
It was then that Paris took on its current form with the construction of 
major arteries boulevards the widening of sidewalks and the creation of 
promenades parks and gardens This redevelopment of the urban landscape 
corresponds to a transformation of urban rhythms and sociability in a city 
that itself became a landscape worth seeing In the urban planning project 
that turned the boulevards into openair lounges public benches which had 
previously been reserved for gardens were adapted to the cityintroducing a 
new sociability Installed along the boulevards they were presented to walkers 
allowing them to pause and relax while enjoying a street scene Beyond the 
bench the boulevards which rethought urban traffic also offered a new 
commercial organisation of pleasure and entertainment public entertainers 
organ players magic lantern artists acrobats and street vendors attracted 
dense crowds which could stroll and stop between the benches kiosks and 
advertising columnsan experience embodied by the French writer Charles 
Baudelaire 18211867 in the figure of the flneur But the boulevard was 
above all the home of cafshubs of sociability that have proliferated in Paris 
since coffee first arrived as an exotic alternative to alcohol in the second half 
of the seventeenth century In fine weather the terraces overflowed onto the 
pavement attracting crowds of customers and bystanders In the caf Parisians 
and tourists alike could experience the pleasure of not doing anything more 
than reading and watching passersby
