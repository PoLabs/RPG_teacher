Regulator Molecules of the Cell Cycle
In addition to the internally controlled checkpoints there are two groups of intracellular molecules that regulate
the cell cycle These regulatory molecules either promote progress of the cell to the next phase positive
regulation or halt the cycle negative regulation Regulator molecules may act individually or they can influence
the activity or production of other regulatory proteins Therefore the failure of a single regulator may have almost
no effect on the cell cycle especially if more than one mechanism controls the same event However the effect
of a deficient or nonfunctioning regulator can be wideranging and possibly fatal to the cell if multiple processes
are affected
Positive Regulation of the Cell Cycle
Two groups of proteins called cyclins and cyclindependent kinases Cdks are termed positive regulators
They are responsible for the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints The levels of the four cyclin
proteins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle in a predictable pattern Figure 1011 Increases in the concentration
of cyclin proteins are triggered by both external and internal signals After the cell moves to the next stage of the
cell cycle the cyclins that were active in the previous stage are degraded by cytoplasmic enzymes as shown in
Figure 1011 below
Figure 1011 The concentrations of cyclin proteins change throughout the cell cycle There is a direct correlation
between cyclin accumulation and the three major cellcycle checkpoints Also note the sharp decline of cyclin levels
following each checkpoint the transition between phases of the cell cycle as cyclin is degraded by cytoplasmic
enzymes credit modification of work by WikiMiMaWikimedia Commons
Cyclins regulate the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to Cdks To be fully active the Cdkcyclin complex
must also be phosphorylated in specific locations to activate the complex Like all kinases Cdks are enzymes
kinases that in turn phosphorylate other proteins Phosphorylation activates the protein by changing its shape
The proteins phosphorylated by Cdks are involved in advancing the cell to the next phase Figure 1012
The levels of Cdk proteins are relatively stable throughout the cell cycle however the concentrations of cyclin
fluctuate and determine when Cdkcyclin complexes form The different cyclins and Cdks bind at specific points
in the cell cycle and thus regulate different checkpoints
