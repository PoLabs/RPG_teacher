open The action potential moves across the entire cell creating a wave of depolarization
ACh is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase AChE into acetyl and choline AChE resides in
the synaptic cleft breaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh receptors which would cause
unwanted extended muscle contraction Figure 3838
Figure 3838 This diagram shows excitationcontraction coupling in a skeletal muscle contraction The
sarcoplasmic reticulum is a specialized endoplasmic reticulum found in muscle cells
The deadly nerve gas Sarin irreversibly inhibits acetycholinesterase What effect would Sarin have on
muscle contraction
After depolarization the membrane returns to its resting state This is called repolarization during which
voltagegated sodium channels close Potassium channels continue at 90 conductance Because the plasma
membrane sodiumpotassium ATPase always transports ions the resting state negatively charged inside
relative to the outside is restored The period immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve
or muscle in which a neuron or muscle cell regains its ability to transmit another impulse is called the refractory
period During the refractory period the membrane cannot generate another action potential The refractory
period allows the voltagesensitive ion channels to return to their resting configurations The sodium potassium
ATPase continually moves Na back out of the cell and K back into the cell and the K leaks out leaving
negative charge behind Very quickly the membrane repolarizes so that it can again be depolarized
