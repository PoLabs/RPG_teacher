uncomfortable and even a little cross
Good morning he said at last We dont want any adventures here thank
you You might try over The Hill or across The Water By this he meant that the
conversation was at an end
What a lot of things you do use Good morning for said Gandalf Now
you mean that you want to get rid of me and that it wont be good till I move
off
Not at all not at all my dear sir Let me see I dont think I know your
name
Yes yes my dear sirand I do know your name Mr Bilbo Baggins And
you do know my name though you dont remember that I belong to it I am
Gandalf and Gandalf means me To think that I should have lived to be good
morninged by Belladonna Tooks son as if I was selling buttons at the door
Gandalf Gandalf Good gracious me Not the wandering wizard that gave
Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never
came undone till ordered Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales
at parties about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and
the unexpected luck of widows sons Not the man that used to make such
particularly excellent fireworks I remember those Old Took used to have them
on Midsummers Eve Splendid They used to go up like great lilies and
snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening You
will notice already that Mr Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to
believe also that he was very fond of flowers Dear me he went on Not the
Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the
Blue for mad adventures Anything from climbing trees to visiting elvesor
sailing in ships sailing to other shores Bless me life used to be quite interI
mean you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time I beg your
pardon but I had no idea you were still in business
Where else should I be said the wizard All the same I am pleased to find
you remember something about me You seem to remember my fireworks
kindly at any rate and that is not without hope Indeed for your old grandfather
Tooks sake and for the sake of poor Belladonna I will give you what you asked
for
I beg your pardon I havent asked for anything
Yes you have Twice now My pardon I give it you In fact I will go so far
as to send you on this adventure Very amusing for me very good for youand
profitable too very likely if you ever get over it
