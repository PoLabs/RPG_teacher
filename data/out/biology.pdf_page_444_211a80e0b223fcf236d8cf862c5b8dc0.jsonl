line What would be the predicted effect on
translation
a
Translation stalls after the initiation AUG
codon is identified

tRNAs cannot exit the E site of the
ribosome
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
19 Imagine if there were 200 commonly occurring
amino acids instead of 20 Given what you know
about the genetic code what would be the shortest
possible codon length Explain
20 Discuss how degeneracy of the genetic code
makes cells more robust to mutations
21 A scientist sequencing mRNA identifies the
following strand
CUAUGUGUCGUAACAGCCGAUGACCCG
What is the sequence of the amino acid chain this
mRNA makes when it is translated
22 If mRNA is complementary to the DNA template
strand and the DNA template strand is
complementary to the DNA nontemplate strand then
why are base sequences of mRNA and the DNA
nontemplate strand not identical Could they ever
be
23 In your own words describe the difference
between rhodependent and rhoindependent
termination of transcription in prokaryotes
24 A fragment of bacterial DNA reads
3
TACCTATAATCTCAATTGATAGAAGCACTCTAC
5
Assuming that this fragment is the template strand
what is the sequence of mRNA that would be
transcribed Hint Be sure to identify the initiation
site
25 A scientist observes that a cell has an RNA
polymerase deficiency that prevents it from making
proteins Describe three additional observations that
would together support the conclusion that a defect in
RNA polymerase I activity and not problems with the
other polymerases causes the defect
26 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients often
harbor nonsense mutations in their spliceosome
machinery Describe how this mutation of the
spliceosome would change the final location and
sequence of a premRNA
27 Transcribe and translate the following DNA
sequence nontemplate strand 5
ATGGCCGGTTATTAAGCA3
28 Explain how single nucleotide changes can have
vastly different effects on protein function
29 A normal mRNA that reads 5 
UGCCAUGGUAAUAACACAUGAGGCCUGAAC 3
has an insertion mutation that changes the sequence
to 5
UGCCAUGGUUAAUAACACAUGAGGCCUGAAC
3 Translate the original mRNA and the mutated
mRNA and explain how insertion mutations can
have dramatic effects on proteins Hint Be sure to
find the initiation site
