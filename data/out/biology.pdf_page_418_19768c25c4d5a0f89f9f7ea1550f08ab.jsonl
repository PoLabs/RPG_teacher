Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids therefore it can be said that the protein
alphabet consists of 20 letters Figure 152 Different amino acids have different chemistries such as acidic
versus basic or polar and nonpolar and different structural constraints Variation in amino acid sequence is
responsible for the enormous variation in protein structure and function
Figure 152 Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown Each amino acid is composed of an amino
group  NH3
  a carboxyl group COO and a side chain blue The side chain may be nonpolar polar or charged
as well as large or small It is the variety of amino acid side chains that gives rise to the incredible variation of protein
structure and function
The Central Dogma DNA Encodes RNA RNA Encodes Protein
The flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the central dogma Figure
153 which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs which in turn specify the sequence of amino
acids making up all proteins The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and
RNAs Because the information stored in DNA is so central to cellular function it makes intuitive sense that
the cell would make mRNA copies of this information for protein synthesis while keeping the DNA itself intact
and protected The copying of DNA to RNA is relatively straightforward with one nucleotide being added to
the mRNA strand for every nucleotide read in the DNA strand The translation to protein is a bit more complex
because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence However the
translation to protein is still systematic and colinear such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1
nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2 and so on
