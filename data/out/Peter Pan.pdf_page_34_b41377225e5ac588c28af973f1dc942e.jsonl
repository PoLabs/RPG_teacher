Shall I after him Captain asked pathetic Smee and tickle him
with Johnny Corkscrew Smee had pleasant names for everything
and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew because he wiggled it in the
wound One could mention many lovable traits in Smee For
instance after killing it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his
weapon
Johnnys a silent fellow he reminded Hook
Not now Smee Hook said darkly He is only one and I want
to mischief all the seven Scatter and look for them
The pirates disappeared among the trees and in a moment their
Captain and Smee were alone Hook heaved a heavy sigh and I
know not why it was perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the
evening but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful
bosun the story of his life He spoke long and earnestly but what it
was all about Smee who was rather stupid did not know in the least
Anon he caught the word Peter
Most of all Hook was saying passionately I want their captain
Peter Pan Twas he cut off my arm He brandished the hook
threateningly Ive waited long to shake his hand with this Oh Ill
tear him
And yet said Smee I have often heard you say that hook was
worth a score of hands for combing the hair and other homely uses
Ay the captain answered if I was a mother I would pray to
have my children born with this instead of that and he cast a look
of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other Then
again he frowned
Peter flung my arm he said wincing to a crocodile that
happened to be passing by
I have often said Smee noticed your strange dread of
crocodiles
Not of crocodiles Hook corrected him but of that one
crocodile He lowered his voice It liked my arm so much Smee
that it has followed me ever since from sea to sea and from land to
land licking its lips for the rest of me
In a way said Smee its sort of a compliment
I want no such compliments Hook barked petulantly I want
Peter Pan who first gave the brute its taste for me
He sat down on a large mushroom and now there was a quiver in
his voice Smee he said huskily that crocodile would have had
me before this but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which
goes tick tick inside it and so before it can reach me I hear the tick
and bolt He laughed but in a hollow way
Some day said Smee the clock will run down and then hell
get you
Hook wetted his dry lips Ay he said thats the fear that haunts
me
Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm Smee he said
this seat is hot He jumped up Odds bobs hammer and tongs Im
burning
