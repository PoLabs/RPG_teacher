Hurry up boy shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen What are you
doing checking for letter bombs He chuckled at his own joke
Harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter He handed
Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to
open the yellow envelope
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over
the postcard
Marges ill he informed Aunt Petunia Ate a funny whelk 
Dad said Dudley suddenly Dad Harrys got something
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the
same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of
his hand by Uncle Vernon
Thats mine said Harry trying to snatch it back
Whod be writing to you sneered Uncle Vernon shaking the letter open
with one hand and glancing at it His face went from red to green faster
than a set of traffic lights And it didnt stop there Within seconds
it was the grayish white of old porridge
PPPetunia he gasped
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but Uncle Vernon held it
high out of his reach Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first
line For a moment it looked as though she might faint She clutched her
throat and made a choking noise
Vernon Oh my goodness  Vernon
They stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that Harry and
Dudley were still in the room Dudley wasnt used to being ignored He
gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick
I want to read that letter he said loudly want to read it said
Harry furiously as its mine
Get out both of you croaked Uncle Vernon stuffing the letter back
inside its envelope
