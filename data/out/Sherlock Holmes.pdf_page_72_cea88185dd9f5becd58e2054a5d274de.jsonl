The Man with the Twisted Lip
I
sa Whitney brother of the late Elias Whit
ney DD Principal of the Theological Col
lege of St Georges was much addicted to
opium The habit grew upon him as I un
derstand from some foolish freak when he was at
college for having read De Quinceys description of
his dreams and sensations he had drenched his to
bacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the
same effects He found as so many more have done
that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid
of and for many years he continued to be a slave to
the drug an object of mingled horror and pity to his
friends and relatives I can see him now with yellow
pasty face drooping lids and pinpoint pupils all
huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble
man
One nightit was in June 89there came a ring
to my bell about the hour when a man gives his rst
yawn and glances at the clock I sat up in my chair
and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap
and made a little face of disappointment
A patient said she Youll have to go out
I groaned for I was newly come back from a weary
day
We heard the door open a few hurried words and
then quick steps upon the linoleum Our own door
ew open and a lady clad in some darkcoloured
stuff with a black veil entered the room
You will excuse my calling so late she began
and then suddenly losing her selfcontrol she ran
forward threw her arms about my wifes neck and
sobbed upon her shoulder Oh Im in such trouble
she cried I do so want a little help
Why said my wife pulling up her veil it is
Kate Whitney How you startled me Kate I had not
an idea who you were when you came in
I didnt know what to do so I came straight to
you That was always the way Folk who were in
grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse
It was very sweet of you to come Now you must
have some wine and water and sit here comfortably
and tell us all about it Or should you rather that I
sent James off to bed
Oh no no I want the doctors advice and help
too Its about Isa He has not been home for two
days I am so frightened about him
It was not the rst time that she had spoken to
us of her husbands trouble to me as a doctor to
my wife as an old friend and school companion We
soothed and comforted her by such words as we could
nd Did she know where her husband was Was it
possible that we could bring him back to her
It seems that it was She had the surest informa
tion that of late he had when the t was on him
made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the
City Hitherto his orgies had always been conned
to one day and he had come back twitching and
shattered in the evening But now the spell had been
upon him eightandforty hours and he lay there
doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in
the poison or sleeping off the effects There he was
to be found she was sure of it at the Bar of Gold in
Upper Swandam Lane But what was she to do How
could she a young and timid woman make her way
into such a place and pluck her husband out from
among the rufans who surrounded him
There was the case and of course there was but
one way out of it Might I not escort her to this place
And then as a second thought why should she come
at all I was Isa Whitneys medical adviser and as
such I had inuence over him I could manage it
better if I were alone I promised her on my word that
I would send him home in a cab within two hours if
he were indeed at the address which she had given
me And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair
and cheery sittingroom behind me and was speed
ing eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as
it seemed to me at the time though the future only
could show how strange it was to be
But there was no great difculty in the rst stage
of my adventure Upper Swandam Lane is a vile al
ley lurking behind the high wharves which line the
north side of the river to the east of London Bridge
Between a slopshop and a ginshop approached by a
steep ight of steps leading down to a black gap like
the mouth of a cave I found the den of which I was
in search Ordering my cab to wait I passed down
the steps worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless
tread of drunken feet and by the light of a ickering
oillamp above the door I found the latch and made
my way into a long low room thick and heavy with
the brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden
berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship
Through the gloom one could dimly catch a
glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses
bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and
chins pointing upward with here and there a dark
lacklustre eye turned upon the newcomer Out of
the black shadows there glimmered little red circles
of light now bright now faint as the burning poison
waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes The
most lay silent but some muttered to themselves and
