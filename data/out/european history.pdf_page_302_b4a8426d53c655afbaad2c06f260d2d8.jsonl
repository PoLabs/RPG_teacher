UNIT 3 POWER AND CITIZENSHIP
282
this was one function of borders it was certainly not the only one As Moritz 
Csky pointed out frontiers also served as places of connection transition 
and mutual influence This becomes clear for instance by looking to Central 
Europes musical and gastronomic styles or by crossborder shared religious 
practices such as the use of Dutch throughout the nineteenth century by some 
Calvinist churches in northwestern Germany In fact many nineteenth
century Europeans lived displaying dual patriotisms without contradiction 
like most Catalans in Spain or Scots in Britain who understood their multiple 
national allegiances not in exclusionary ways but in aggregate terms 
Conclusion 
The nationstate was one of the most significant phenomena of nineteenth
century Europe with immense political social economic and cultural impact 
It changed the map of Europe strengthened the connections of regions citizens 
and often monarchs to the central state and impressed the significance of its 
borders to other nationstates However its apparent omnipresence in the 
discourse of the period should not be overemphasised as individual and 
regional identities continued to be crossed by a multiplicity of allegiances 
and interests of a different nature and clearcut ethnic differentiations did not 
always take precedence over everyday practices In any case national tensions 
not only persisted in Europe but would intensify in the course of the twentieth 
century
