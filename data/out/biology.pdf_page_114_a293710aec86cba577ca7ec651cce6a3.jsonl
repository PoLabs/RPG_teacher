35 Nucleic Acids
Nucleic acids are molecules comprised of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such as cell division and
protein synthesis Pentose sugar a nitrogenous base and a phosphate group comprise each nucleotide There
are two types of nucleic acids DNA and RNA DNA carries the cells genetic blueprint and passes it on from
parents to offspring in the form of chromosomes It has a doublehelical structure with the two strands running
in opposite directions connected by hydrogen bonds and complementary to each other RNA is a single
stranded polymer composed of linked nucleotides made up of a pentose sugar ribose a nitrogenous base
and a phosphate group RNA is involved in protein synthesis and its regulation Messenger RNA mRNA
copies from the DNA exports itself from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and contains information for constructing
proteins Ribosomal RNA rRNA is a part of the ribosomes at the site of protein synthesis whereas transfer
RNA tRNA carries the amino acid to the site of protein synthesis The microRNA regulates using mRNA for
protein synthesis
