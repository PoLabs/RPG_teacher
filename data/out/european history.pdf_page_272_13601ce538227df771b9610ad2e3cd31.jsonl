the dissolution of the USSR Generally speaking Europe is characterised by 
lower income inequality than the United States but recent decades have seen 
income inequality in many European countries start to edge upwards again 
With the publication of the French economist Thomas Pikettys Capital in the 
TwentyFirst Century in 2013 the topic of income versus wealth hit centre
stage for policymakers across Europe What Piketty observes for France 
which can also be demonstrated for other Western European countries is 
that wealth inequality historically far outstrips inequality from labour by 
about seven times This pattern can be disrupted and in the twentieth century 
was dramatically altered thanks to the First and Second World Wars which 
destroyed much of the capital from which wealth derives This was followed 
by a period of extraordinary economic growth and high taxation which kept 
inequality in check However since the 1980s wealth versus income inequality 
has been growing again and although it has not reached the seventoone level 
seen prior to the World Wars it seems set to continue growing in the absence 
of a concerted attempt to tax wealth rather than income 
Interesting contrasts emerge when you compare wealth inequality to 
income inequality The Netherlands for instance has relatively low levels of 
income inequality but extraordinarily high levels of wealth inequality with 
the wealthiest one percent of the population owning one third of private assets 
One classic way to grasp and explain wealth inequalities in the world is 
rooted in the Marxist tradition whose central concept is class According to 
the Marxist analysis social classes are formed in relation to the possession of 
the means of production whose forms change historically and geographically 
In the feudal era this was land and the main contrast lay between landowners 
landlords and landless peasants In the era of capitalism the main means 
of production were factories and the two main classes were capitalists and 
workers While the German scholar Karl Marx 18181883 recognised the 
economic and social development and human energies that capitalism 
unleashed he also thought that the relationship between these two classes 
was antagonistic and that capitalism greatly increased income inequalities in 
the countries where this system developed first and foremost in England 
He and the German scholar and businessman Friedrich Engels 18201895 
summarised their thoughts in The Communist Manifesto published in 1848 in 
which they called for a revolution led by the working class with the aim to 
abolish capitalism and the private ownership of the means of production in 
order to liberate workers from the exploitation of the capitalist class 
This idea was first realised in Soviet Russia where the October Revolution 
in 1917 sought to establish a new economic and social system which was 
later called state socialism or communism War communism was abandoned
