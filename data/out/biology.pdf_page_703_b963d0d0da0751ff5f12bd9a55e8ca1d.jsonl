Dutch Elm Disease
Question Do trees resistant to Dutch elm disease secrete antifungal compounds
Hypothesis Construct a hypothesis that addresses this question
Background Dutch elm disease is a fungal infestation that affects many species of elm Ulmus in North
America The fungus infects the vascular system of the tree which blocks water flow within the plant and
mimics drought stress Accidently introduced to the United States in the early 1930s it decimated American
elm shade trees across the continent It is caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi The elm bark beetle
acts as a vector and transmits the disease from tree to tree Many European and Asiatic elms are less
susceptible to the disease than are American elms
Test the hypothesis A researcher testing this hypothesis might do the following Inoculate several Petri
plates containing a medium that supports the growth of fungi with fragments of Ophiostoma mycelium Cut
with a metal punch several disks from the vascular tissue of susceptible varieties of American elms and
resistant European and Asiatic elms Include control Petri plates inoculated with mycelia without plant tissue
to verify that the medium and incubation conditions do not interfere with fungal growth As a positive control
add paper disks impregnated with a known fungicide to Petri plates inoculated with the mycelium
Incubate the plates for a set number of days to allow fungal growth and spreading of the mycelium over the
surface of the plate Record the diameter of the zone of clearing if any around the tissue samples and the
fungicide control disk
Record your observations in the following table

Analyze the data and report the results Compare the effect of distilled water to the fungicide These are
negative and positive controls that validate the experimental setup The fungicide should be surrounded by
a clear zone where the fungus growth was inhibited Is there a difference among different species of elm
Draw a conclusion Was there antifungal activity as expected from the fungicide Did the results support
the hypothesis If not how can this be explained There are several possible explanations
