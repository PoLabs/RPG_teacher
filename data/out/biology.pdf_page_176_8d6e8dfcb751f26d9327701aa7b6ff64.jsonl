Exocytosis
The reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis Exocytosis is the opposite of
the processes we discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular
fluid Waste material is enveloped in a membrane and fuses with the plasma membranes interior This fusion
opens the membranous envelope on the cells exterior and the waste material expels into the extracellular space
Figure 523 Other examples of cells releasing molecules via exocytosis include extracellular matrix protein
secretion and neurotransmitter secretion into the synaptic cleft by synaptic vesicles
Figure 523 In exocytosis vesicles containing substances fuse with the plasma membrane The contents then release
to the cells exterior credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal
