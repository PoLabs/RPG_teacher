Synaptic Plasticity
Synapses are not static structures They can be weakened or strengthened They can be broken and new
synapses can be made Synaptic plasticity allows for these changes which are all needed for a functioning
nervous system In fact synaptic plasticity is the basis of learning and memory Two processes in particular
longterm potentiation LTP and longterm depression LTD are important forms of synaptic plasticity that occur
in synapses in the hippocampus a brain region that is involved in storing memories
Longterm Potentiation LTP
Longterm potentiation LTP is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection LTP is based on the
Hebbian principle cells that fire together wire together There are various mechanisms none fully understood
behind the synaptic strengthening seen with LTP One known mechanism involves a type of postsynaptic
glutamate receptor called NMDA NMethylDaspartate receptors shown in Figure 3518 These receptors
are normally blocked by magnesium ions however when the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized by multiple
presynaptic inputs in quick succession either from one neuron or multiple neurons the magnesium ions
are forced out allowing Ca ions to pass into the postsynaptic cell Next Ca2 ions entering the cell initiate
a
signaling
cascade
that
causes
a
different
type
of
glutamate
receptor
called
AMPA

amino3hydroxy5methyl4isoxazolepropionic acid receptors to be inserted into the postsynaptic membrane
since activated AMPA receptors allow positive ions to enter the cell So the next time glutamate is released
from the presynaptic membrane it will have a larger excitatory effect EPSP on the postsynaptic cell because
the binding of glutamate to these AMPA receptors will allow more positive ions into the cell The insertion of
additional AMPA receptors strengthens the synapse and means that the postsynaptic neuron is more likely to
fire in response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release Some drugs of abuse coopt the LTP pathway and this
synaptic strengthening can lead to addiction
Longterm Depression LTD
Longterm depression LTD is essentially the reverse of LTP it is a longterm weakening of a synaptic
connection One mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors In this situation calcium that
enters through NMDA receptors initiates a different signaling cascade which results in the removal of AMPA
receptors from the postsynaptic membrane as illustrated in Figure 3518 The decrease in AMPA receptors
in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic
neuron While it may seem counterintuitive LTD may be just as important for learning and memory as LTP
The weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant connections to be lost and makes the
synapses that have undergone LTP that much stronger by comparison
