Introduction
The use of the past for contemporary purposes was hardly a new phenomenon 
in the nineteenth century The period nevertheless saw profound change in 
how societies related to the past and its tangible and intangible remnants 
There was a new sense of radical discontinuity between the past and the 
present the past became a distant and distinct sphere inaccessible and yet 
open to the curiosity of historians and amateurs alike A modern historical 
culture emerged that was marked by widespread interest in the past and its 
remnants History provided a reassuring sense of continuity and progression 
sanctioning national claims and rooting these claims in the past History could 
provide a measure of advancement and a signpost for future development The 
past became a matter of public interest and an important foundation for the 
construction of modern national identities No wonder then that by the late 
nineteenth century the social relevance of history was in evidence virtually 
everywhere from the founding of new museums to historicallyinformed 
street naming from school curricula to urban heritage preservation initiatives 
This chapter brings this development to the fore while focusing in particular 
on the creation of national heritage the dissemination of national memory in 
public spaces and the construction of urban heritage
The Making of National Heritage
The rise of national heritage was a process during which antiquities and 
artworks were appropriated and reinterpreted as representing a national past 
and belonging to a particular nationrather than belonging to their previous 
princely ecclesiastical noble or municipal owners The French Revolution 
played a seminal role in this process The initial destruction of cultural artifacts
