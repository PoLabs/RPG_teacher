the institutionalisation of industrial research The founding of the Kaiser 
Wilhelm Gesellschaft in Germany 1911 for example made it possible to 
intensify collaboration between industrialists and scientists During the war 
the creation in Britain of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research 
19151916 was part of the same movement lasting until after the Second 
World War The Second World War whose outcome demonstrated the 
importance of scientific mobilisation in times of conflict was followed by a 
strengthening of ties between science and industry In Germany for example 
the Fraunhofer Society 1949 was charged with funding applied research 
By the 1960s however a new dynamic was established as a result of 
the space race and the Sputnik shock The creation of the OECD in 1961 
provided an opportunity for coordination across Western European states 
aimed at promoting industrial research National ambitions to connect 
science and industry led to the creation of the Ministry of Technology in Great 
Britain 1965 and the Agence nationale de valorisation de la recherche in 
France 1967 The economic crisis of the 1970s the emergence of Japan as a 
technological power and the development of new technologies information 
technology biotechnology would later encourage European economic 
powers to strengthen on a transatlantic scale the links between science and 
industry With the support of the OECD the European Industrial Management 
Association was created in 1965 on the model of the US Industrial Research 
Institute 1938 This institution brought together major European companies 
on matters of research and development and helped establish new links 
with the academic world In this new context new forms of collaboration 
were established between universities and economic players Technopoles 
were developed such as the Sophia Antipolis Technology Park 1969 and 
the Cambridge Science Park 1970 In addition companies reoriented their 
activities Solvay for example turned from 1977 towards the biochemical 
industry One of the major features of this period was the globalisation of 
research and development which corresponded to the globalisation of trade 
Today large multinational companies structure their industrial research on a 
world scale and must manage their collaborations with the academic world at 
the same level
The professionalisation of university management in this period seemed 
to become as inescapable as the growing importance of administrative tasks 
in the academy Ideas from New Public Management have found their way 
into many educational institutions Neoliberal elements have steadily grown 
in the fields of science education and culturein Western Europe since the 
1970s and in Eastern Europe since the 1990s Economic theories and practices 
of corporate governance have deeply affected researchers educationists and 
cultural workers in the European sphere as well as internationally This has
