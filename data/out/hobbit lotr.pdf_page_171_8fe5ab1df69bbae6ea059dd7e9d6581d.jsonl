Chapter XII
INSIDE INFORMATION
For a long time the dwarves stood in the dark before the door and debated until
at last Thorin spoke
Now is the time for our esteemed Mr Baggins who has proved himself a
good companion on our long road and a hobbit full of courage and resource far
exceeding his size and if I may say so possessed of good luck far exceeding the
usual allowancenow is the time for him to perform the service for which he
was included in our Company now is the time for him to earn his Reward
You are familiar with Thorins style on important occasions so I will not give
you any more of it though he went on a good deal longer than this It certainly
was an important occasion but Bilbo felt impatient By now he was quite
familiar with Thorin too and he knew what he was driving at
If you mean you think it is my job to go into the secret passage first O
Thorin Thrains son Oakenshield may your beard grow ever longer he said
crossly say so at once and have done I might refuse I have got you out of two
messes already which were hardly in the original bargain so that I am I think
already owed some reward But third time pays for all as my father used to say
and somehow I dont think I shall refuse Perhaps I have begun to trust my luck
more than I used to in the old dayshe meant last spring before he left his own
house but it seemed centuries agobut anyway I think I will go and have a
peep at once and get it over Now who is coming with me
He did not expect a chorus of volunteers so he was not disappointed Fili and
Kili looked uncomfortable and stood on one leg but the others made no pretence
of offeringexcept old Balin the lookout man who was rather fond of the
hobbit He said he would come inside at least and perhaps a bit of the way too
ready to call for help if necessary
