political economic and cultural influence 
By 1970 many countries beyond Europe and North America were producing 
bikes motorcycles cars fridges radio televisions and washing machines 
The aviation industry beyond small aircraft remained a privilege of few 
global centres While some of these national industries were not profitable as 
the century progressed many countries beyond Europe and North America 
found success in producing all kinds of technologies for export as well as 
domestic demand Since the 1970s the state often retreated from these 
industries Many of them flourished under private ownership but we should 
not forget that without public intervention they would have never come to 
exist in the first place Moreover in the second half of the century there were 
several nonEuropean countries able to compete and succeed in development 
and industrial production at the global level namely Japan South Korea and 
towards the end of the century also China and Brazil Embraer airplanes 
Robotics computers and gaming gadgets such as those produced by Nintendo 
clearly show that East Asian countries are not merely skilful imitators of a 
Western technology but instead that they have contributed on more than 
equal terms to shape technological development in the twentieth and twenty
first centuries setting trends in the production and consumption of technology 
While the logic of the national economy dominated technological production 
during the middle decades of the century the closing decades were marked by 
a process of globalisation and delocalisation the actual production of goods 
moved from rich industrialised countries to countries that could provide 
large firms with human capital and reasonable infrastructures but without 
strong efforts to impose environmental and labour regulations Hightech 
industries have been impacted less by this trend while the more optimistic 
view among economists is that the socalled knowledge economy is now 
the highest stage of human economic development in a globalised world 
However the issue of how scientific research and technology are shaped by 
power and identity including the specific locations of company headquarters 
and their sites of production the legal framework that regulates the research 
patenting production testing distribution and use of technologiesand even 
the nationalities of researchers and producers has been brought back into the
