Cooperation between Bacteria and Eukaryotes Nitrogen Fixation
Nitrogen is a very important element to living things because it is part of nucleotides and amino acids that are
the building blocks of nucleic acids and proteins respectively Nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in
terrestrial ecosystems with atmospheric nitrogen N2 providing the largest pool of available nitrogen However
eukaryotes cannot use atmospheric gaseous nitrogen to synthesize macromolecules Fortunately nitrogen
can be fixed meaning it is converted into a more accessible formammonia NH3either biologically or
abiotically
Abiotic nitrogen fixation occurs as a result of physical processes such as lightning or by industrial processes
Biological nitrogen fixation BNF is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes soil bacteria cyanobacteria
and Frankia spp filamentous bacteria interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder bayberry and sweet
fern After photosynthesis BNF is the most important biological process on Earth The overall nitrogen fixation
equation below represents a series of redox reactions Pi stands for inorganic phosphate
N2   16ATP  8e  8H   2NH3   16ADP  16Pi  H2
The total fixed nitrogen through BNF is about 100 to 180 million metric tons per year which contributes about 65
percent of the nitrogen used in agriculture
Cyanobacteria are the most important nitrogen fixers in aquatic environments In soil members of the genera
Clostridium and Azotobacter are examples of freeliving nitrogenfixing bacteria Other bacteria live
symbiotically with legume plants providing the most important source of fixed nitrogen Symbionts may fix
more nitrogen in soils than freeliving organisms by a factor of 10 Soil bacteria collectively called rhizobia
are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form nodules specialized structures where nitrogen fixation
occurs Figure 2227 Nitrogenase the enzyme that fixes nitrogen is inactivated by oxygen so the nodule
provides an oxygenfree area for nitrogen fixation to take place The oxygen is sequestered by a form of
plant hemoglobin called leghemoglobin which protects the nitrogenase but releases enough oxygen to support
respiratory activity
Symbiotic nitrogen fixation provides a natural and inexpensive plant fertilizer It reduces atmospheric nitrogen
to ammonia which is easily usable by plants The use of legumes is an excellent alternative to chemical
fertilization and is of special interest to sustainable agriculture which seeks to minimize the use of chemicals and
conserve natural resources Through symbiotic nitrogen fixation the plant benefits from using an endless source
of nitrogen the atmosphere The bacteria benefit from using photosynthates carbohydrates produced during
photosynthesis from the plant and having a protected niche In addition the soil benefits from being naturally
fertilized Therefore the use of rhizobia as biofertilizers is a sustainable practice
Why are legumes so important Some like soybeans are key sources of agricultural protein Some of the most
important legumes consumed by humans are soybeans peanuts peas chickpeas and beans Other legumes
such as alfalfa are used to feed cattle

symbiotically with the soil bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum to form specialized structures on the roots called
nodules where nitrogen fixation occurs credit USDA
