unfolding unevenly across different regions of Britain and Europe and see it 
and its associated social and economic changes as a spatially dynamic process 
shaped by local contexts These interpretations can be divided into two major 
strands The first strand is more optimistic claiming that as industrialisation 
took off living standards generally improved despite an unequal distribution 
of wealth the less fortunate also gained from industrialisation After all in 
general the nineteenth century witnessed rising wages of industrial workers 
and gradual expansion of industrial production across the continent and 
there were material benefits from this process for ordinary people The second 
view is far more pessimistic This view emphasises the fact that gains from 
industrialisation were more complex and the situation differed depending on 
a number of variables Rising wages alone those who subscribe to this view 
would argue do not simply guarantee better living to assess industrialisation 
it would be necessary to consider changes in social relations general price 
levels and other types of social costs All in all there is today a widespread 
consensus on the fact that at some point in the process of industrialisation 
living standards did indeed start to grow and wealth distribution became 
more equal
Current debates focus mostly on the exact timing of the change in the 
trend starting either in the early nineteenth century or only in its second half 
depending on the particular place and how universally it applies again 
mostly depending on location but also on social position The arrival of 
industrialisation undoubtedly exacerbated divisions of income and fuelled 
rising social and economic inequality but there was a certain levelling later in 
the process At the beginning large parts of the population were left behind and 
did not gain from the benefits and wealth brought about by industrialisation 
The use of machinery and growing factory production first in Britain later 
elsewhere triggered a rapid growth of productivity and profits in which 
workers did not share Due to the almost limitless supply of labour coming 
from the rural countryside factory owners could keep wages at the subsistence 
level Furthermore many local producers and craftsmen could not compete 
with the high quality and cheap price of industrial production and fell into 
poverty with their families The initial stage of the industrial revolution was 
thus characterised by extremely uneven distribution of profits which resulted 
in a growing army of urban poor a relatively in numbers small capitalist class 
and an emerging middle classmerchants skilled employees shopkeepers 
or bureaucrats 
Striking contrasts between the modern and healthy lives of the wealthy 
moving in carriages on paved streets from their villas and palaces to summer 
houses in the countryside and the urban poor often surviving on the streets or 
in overcrowded cottages and slums in unsanitary conditions spending most of 
their time manually working or looking for work became symbolic expressions
