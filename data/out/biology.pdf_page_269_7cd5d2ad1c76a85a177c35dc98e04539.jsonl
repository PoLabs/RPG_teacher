Figure 98 A receptor tyrosine kinase is an enzymelinked receptor with a single helical transmembrane region
and extracellular and intracellular domains Binding of a signaling molecule to the extracellular domain causes
the receptor to dimerize Tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain are then autophosphorylated triggering a
downstream cellular response The signal is terminated by a phosphatase that removes the phosphates from the
phosphotyrosine residues
HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase In 30 percent of human breast cancers HER2 is permanently activated
resulting in unregulated cell division Lapatinib a drug used to treat breast cancer inhibits HER2 receptor
tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation the process by which the receptor adds phosphates onto itself thus
reducing tumor growth by 50 percent Besides autophosphorylation which of the following steps would be
inhibited by Lapatinib
a
Signaling molecule binding dimerization and the downstream cellular response
b
Dimerization and the downstream cellular response
c
The downstream cellular response
d
Phosphatase activity dimerization and the downsteam cellular response
