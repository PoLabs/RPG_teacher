122  Characteristics and Traits
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes in dominant and recessive gene systems

Develop a Punnett square to calculate the expected proportions of genotypes and phenotypes in a
monohybrid cross

Explain the purpose and methods of a test cross

Identify nonMendelian inheritance patterns such as incomplete dominance codominance recessive
lethals multiple alleles and sex linkage
Physical characteristics are expressed through genes carried on chromosomes The genetic makeup of peas
consists of two similar or homologous copies of each chromosome one from each parent Each pair of
homologous chromosomes has the same linear order of genes In other words peas are diploid organisms in
that they have two copies of each chromosome The same is true for many other plants and for virtually all
animals Diploid organisms produce haploid gametes which contain one copy of each homologous chromosome
that unite at fertilization to create a diploid zygote
For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic a diploid organism has two genetic copies that
may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at
the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called alleles Mendel examined the inheritance
of genes with just two allele forms but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a
natural population
Phenotypes and Genotypes
Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics
The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype An organisms underlying
genetic makeup consisting of both physically visible and nonexpressed alleles is called its genotype Mendels
hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype When truebreeding
plants in which one parent had yellow pods and one had green pods were crossfertilized all of the F1 hybrid
offspring had yellow pods That is the hybrid offspring were phenotypically identical to the truebreeding parent
with yellow pods However we know that the allele donated by the parent with green pods was not simply
lost because it reappeared in some of the F2 offspring Therefore the F1 plants must have been genotypically
different from the parent with yellow pods
The P1 plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying
Diploid organisms that are homozygous at a given gene or locus have two identical alleles for that gene on
their homologous chromosomes Mendels parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes
produced carried the same trait When P1 plants with contrasting traits were crossfertilized all of the offspring
were heterozygous for the contrasting trait meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles
for the gene being examined
Dominant and Recessive Alleles
Our discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to why the F1 heterozygous offspring
were identical to one of the parents rather than expressing both alleles In all seven peaplant characteristics
one of the two contrasting alleles was dominant and the other was recessive Mendel called the dominant allele
the expressed unit factor the recessive allele was referred to as the latent unit factor We now know that these
socalled unit factors are actually genes on homologous chromosome pairs For a gene that is expressed in
a dominant and recessive pattern homozygous dominant and heterozygous organisms will look identical that
is they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype The recessive allele will only be observed in
homozygous recessive individuals Table 124
