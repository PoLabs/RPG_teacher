vessels are contractile although there is usually no regular circulatory pathway and movement of blood is also
facilitated by the contraction of muscles in the body wall The circulation of fluids in the rhychocoel is more or less
independent of the blood circulation although blind branches from the blood vessels into the rhyncocoel wall
can mediate exchange of materials between them A pair of protonephridia or excretory tubules is present in
these animals to facilitate osmoregulation Gaseous exchange occurs through the skin
Nervous System
Nemerteans have a brain composed of four ganglia situated at the anterior end around the rhynchocoel
Paired longitudinal nerve cords emerge from the brain ganglia and extend to the posterior end Additional nerve
cords are found in some species Interestingly the brain can contain hemoglobin which acts as an oxygen
reserve Ocelli or eyespots are present in pairs in multiples of two in the anterior portion of the body It is
speculated that the eyespots originate from neural tissue and not from the epidermis
Reproduction
Nemerteans like flatworms have excellent powers of regeneration and asexual reproduction by fragmentation
is seen in some species Most animals in phylum Nemertea are dioecious although freshwater species may
be hermaphroditic Stem cells that become gametes aggregate within gonads placed along the digestive tract
Eggs and sperm are released into the water and fertilization occurs externally Like most lophotrochozoan
protostomes cleavage is spiral and development is usually direct although some species have a trochophore
like larva in which a young worm is constructed from a series of imaginal discs that begin as invaginations from
the body surface of the larva
284  Superphylum Lophotrochozoa Molluscs and
Annelids
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the unique anatomical and morphological features of molluscs and annelids

Describe the formation of the coelom

Identify an important extracoelomic cavity in molluscs

Describe the major body regions of Mollusca and how they vary in different molluscan classes

Discuss the advantages of true body segmentation

Describe the features of animals classified in phylum Annelida
The annelids and the mollusks are the most familiar of the lophotrochozoan protostomes They are also more
typical lophotrochozoans since both groups include aquatic species with trochophore larvae which unite both
taxa in common ancestry These phyla show how a flexible body plan can lead to biological success in terms
of abundance and species diversity The phylum Mollusca has the second greatest number of species of all
animal phyla with nearly 100000 described extant species and about 80000 described extinct species In fact
it is estimated that about 25 percent of all known marine species are mollusks The annelids and mollusca are
both bilaterally symmetrical cephalized triploblastic schizocoelous eucoeolomates They include animals you
are likely to see in your backyard or on your dinner plate
Phylum Mollusca
The name Mollusca means soft body since the earliest descriptions of molluscs came from observations of
squishy unshelled cuttlefish Molluscs are predominantly a marine group of animals however they are also
known to inhabit freshwater as well as terrestrial habitats This enormous phylum includes chitons tusk shells
snails slugs nudibranchs sea butterflies clams mussels oysters squids octopuses and nautiluses Molluscs
display a wide range of morphologies in each class and subclass but share a few key characteristics Figure
2821 The chief locomotor structure is usually a muscular foot Most internal organs are contained in a region
called the visceral mass Overlying the visceral mass is a fold of tissue called the mantle within the cavity
formed by the mantle are respiratory structures called gills that typically fold over the visceral mass The mouths
of most mollusks except bivalves eg clams contain a specialized feeding organ called a radula an abrasive
tonguelike structure Finally the mantle secretes a calciumcarbonatehardened shell in most molluscs although
