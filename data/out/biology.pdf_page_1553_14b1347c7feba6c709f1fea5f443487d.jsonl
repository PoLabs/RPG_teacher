of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood and breathing and heart rate increase In phase three orgasm rhythmic
involuntary contractions of muscles occur In the male reproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict depositing
semen in the urethra then the urethra contracts expelling the semen through the penis In women the uterus and
vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a second each In phase four resolution the
processes listed in the first three phases reverse themselves and return to their normal state Men experience a
refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period of time ranging from minutes to
hours Women do not experience a refractory period 37 Negative feedback in the male system is supplied through
two hormones inhibin and testosterone Inhibin is produced by Sertoli cells when the sperm count exceeds set limits
The hormone inhibits GnRH and FSH decreasing the activity of the Sertoli cells Increased levels of testosterone affect
the release of both GnRH and LH decreasing the activity of the Leydig cells resulting in decreased testosterone and
sperm production
39 The first trimester lays down the basic structures of the body including the limb buds heart
eyes and the liver The second trimester continues the development of all of the organs and systems established
during the first trimester The placenta takes over the production of estrogen and high levels of progesterone and
handles the nutrient and waste requirements of the fetus The third trimester exhibits the greatest growth of the fetus
culminating in labor and delivery 41 Multiple sperm can fuse with the egg resulting in polyspermy The resulting
embryo is not genetically viable and dies within a few days 43 Organs form from the germ layers through the process
of differentiation During differentiation the embryonic stem cells express a specific set of genes that will determine
their ultimate fate as a cell type For example some cells in the ectoderm will express the genes specific to skin
cells As a result these cells will differentiate into epidermal cells The process of differentiation is regulated by cellular
signaling cascades

1 Figure 4410 Tropical lakes dont freeze so they dont undergo spring turnover in the same way temperate lakes do
However stratification does occur as well as seasonal turnover 3 Figure 4421 B the photic zone the intertidal zone

ecology might ask similar questions about how the biotic and abiotic conditions affect particular organisms and
thus might find collaboration to be mutually beneficial Levels of ecology such as community ecology or ecosystem
ecology might pose greater challenges for collaboration because these areas are very broad and may include many
different environmental components 16 Ocean upwelling is a continual process that occurs yearround Spring and
fall turnover in freshwater lakes and ponds however is a seasonal process that occurs due to temperature changes
in the water that take place during springtime warming and autumn cooling Both ocean upwelling and spring and fall
turnover enable nutrients in the organic materials at the bottom of the body of water to be recycled and reused by
living things 18 Fire is less common in desert biomes than in temperate grasslands because deserts have low net
primary productivity and thus very little plant biomass to fuel a fire 20 Bogs are low in oxygen and high in organic
acids The low oxygen content and the low pH both slow the rate of decomposition 22 Natural processes such as
the Milankovitch cycles variation in solar intensity and volcanic eruptions can cause periodic intermittent changes in
global climate Human activity in the form of emissions from the burning of fossil fuels has caused a progressive rise
in the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide

back into the population and at a later time recapture penguins to see what percentage of the recaptured penguins
was tagged This percentage would allow an estimation of the size of the penguin population 32 Parental care is not
feasible for organisms having many offspring because they do not have the energy available to take care of offspring
Most of their energy budget is used in the formation of seeds or offspring so there is little left for parental care Also
the sheer number of offspring would make individual parental care impossible 34 In the first part of the curve when
few individuals of the species are present and resources are plentiful growth is exponential similar to a Jshaped
curve Later growth slows due to the species using up resources Finally the population levels off at the carrying
capacity of the environment and it is relatively stable over time 36 If a natural disaster such as a fire happened in
the winter when populations are low it would have a greater effect on the overall population and its recovery than if
the same disaster occurred during the summer when population levels are high 38 Continued exponential human
population growth results in the human population requiring more resources to sustain itself These resources are
usually taken at the expense of the environment and the organisms that rely on the resources in that environment
eg habitat destruction for human development water rerouting for irrigation etc The continued use of fossil fuels
to generate power for human activities also contributes to climate change changing climates in some areas so that
certain species can no longer survive there
40 Jaguars are an apex predator in the Amazon eating a variety of prey
animals and not serving as prey to any other predators Through predation they control the population sizes of the
smaller herbivores and omnivores If jaguars were to disappear from the ecosystem the smaller herbivore populations
would dramatically increase and could overconsume the plant populations
