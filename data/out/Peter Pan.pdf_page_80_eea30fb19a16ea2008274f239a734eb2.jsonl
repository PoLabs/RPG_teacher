Good form However much he may have degenerated he still
knew that this is all that really matters
From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals and
through them came a stern taptaptap like hammering in the night
when one cannot sleep Have you been good form today was
their eternal question
Fame fame that glittering bauble it is mine he cried
Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything the taptap
from his school replied
I am the only man whom Barbecue feared he urged and Flint
feared Barbecue
Barbecue Flintwhat house came the cutting retort
Most disquieting reflection of all was it not bad form to think
about good form
His vitals were tortured by this problem It was a claw within him
sharper than the iron one and as it tore him the perspiration dripped
down his tallow countenance and streaked his doublet Ofttimes he
drew his sleeve across his face but there was no damming that
trickle
Ah envy not Hook
There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution It was
as if Peters terrible oath had boarded the ship Hook felt a gloomy
desire to make his dying speech lest presently there should be no
time for it
Better for Hook he cried if he had had less ambition It was
in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third
person
No little children to love me
Strange that he should think of this which had never troubled him
before perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind For long
he muttered to himself staring at Smee who was hemming placidly
under the conviction that all children feared him
Feared him Feared Smee There was not a child on board the brig
that night who did not already love him He had said horrid things to
them and hit them with the palm of his hand because he could not
hit with his fist but they had only clung to him the more Michael
had tried on his spectacles
To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable Hook itched to
do it but it seemed too brutal Instead he revolved this mystery in
his mind why do they find Smee lovable He pursued the problem
like the sleuthhound that he was If Smee was lovable what was it
that made him so A terrible answer suddenly presented itself
Good form
Had the bosun good form without knowing it which is the best
form of all
He remembered that you have to prove you dont know you have
it before you are eligible for Pop
With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smees head but
he did not tear What arrested him was this reflection
To claw a man because he is good form what would that be
