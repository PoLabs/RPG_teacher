Species Distribution
In addition to measuring simple density further information about a population can be obtained by looking
at the distribution of the individuals Species dispersion patterns or distribution patterns show the spatial
relationship between members of a population within a habitat at a particular point in time In other words they
show whether members of the species live close together or far apart and what patterns are evident when they
are spaced apart
Individuals in a population can be equally spaced apart dispersed randomly with no predictable pattern or
clustered in groups These are known as uniform random and clumped dispersion patterns respectively
Figure 455 Uniform dispersion is observed in plants that secrete substances inhibiting the growth of nearby
individuals such as the release of toxic chemicals by the sage plant Salvia leucophylla a phenomenon called
allelopathy and in animals like the penguin that maintain a defined territory An example of random dispersion
occurs with dandelion and other plants that have winddispersed seeds that germinate wherever they happen
to fall in a favorable environment A clumped dispersion may be seen in plants that drop their seeds straight
to the ground such as oak trees or in animals that live in groups schools of fish or herds of elephants
Clumped dispersions may also be a function of habitat heterogeneity Thus the dispersion of the individuals
within a population provides more information about how they interact with each other than does a simple density
measurement Just as lower density species might have more difficulty finding a mate solitary species with a
random distribution might have a similar difficulty when compared to social species clumped together in groups
Figure 455 Species may have uniform random or clumped distribution Territorial birds such as penguins tend
to have uniform distribution Plants such as dandelions with winddispersed seeds tend to be randomly distributed
Animals such as elephants that travel in groups exhibit clumped distribution credit a modification of work by Ben

Demography
While population size and density describe a population at one particular point in time scientists must use
demography to study the dynamics of a population Demography is the statistical study of population changes
over time birth rates death rates and life expectancies Each of these measures especially birth rates may
be affected by the population characteristics described above For example a large population size results in a
higher birth rate because more potentially reproductive individuals are present In contrast a large population
size can also result in a higher death rate because of competition disease and the accumulation of waste
Similarly a higher population density or a clumped dispersion pattern results in more potential reproductive
encounters between individuals which can increase birth rate Lastly a femalebiased sex ratio the ratio of
males to females or age structure the proportion of population members at specific age ranges composed of
many individuals of reproductive age can increase birth rates
In addition the demographic characteristics of a population can influence how the population grows or declines
over time If birth and death rates are equal the population remains stable However the population size will
increase if birth rates exceed death rates the population will decrease if birth rates are less than death rates
Life expectancy is another important factor the length of time individuals remain in the population impacts local
resources reproduction and the overall health of the population These demographic characteristics are often
displayed in the form of a life table
Life Tables
Life tables provide important information about the life history of an organism Life tables divide the population
into age groups and often sexes and show how long a member of that group is likely to live They are modeled
