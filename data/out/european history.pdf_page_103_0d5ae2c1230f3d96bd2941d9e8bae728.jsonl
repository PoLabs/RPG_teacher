13 MIGRATION

returned before the First World War and half of the Italians who moved to the 
USA between 1905 and 1915 moved back to Italy
Despite the fact that migration between Europe and the Americas was the 
most substantial movement of people in the nineteenth century it is important 
to note that other parts of the world were also part of this global migration 
system For instance between 1848 and 1882 some 300000 Chinese labourers 
came to the USA mainly to work in railway construction or gold mines
until the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 banned all Chinese migration until 
1943 Even more significant is slavery and the slave trade Although the 
number of people enslaved and traded quickly declined in the first half of the 
century and came to an end in the second half its impact on the USA and 
other migrant societies remained crucial Equally important is how the end 
of slavery resulted in intraimperial migration of indentured labourers who 
were needed to compensate for the loss of labour from enslaved Africans and 
who were employed under conditions that differed only marginally from that 
of slavery People were also on the move in the nineteenth century between 
nonEuropean parts of colonial empiresbetween India Kenya and South 
Africa between the Dutch Indies and Surinam In this colonial framework we 
also catch a glimpse of the history of the odd one out France While it was for 
most of the century the only European country with an immigration surplus
as a result of the large number of British Belgian German Italian Russian and 
notably Polish immigrantssome 700000 French nationals moved to Algeria 
after it was occupied in 1830 and incorporated as a department of the French 
state in 1848
Conclusion
From the point of international and especially overseas migration the 
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries formed a continuum The First 
World War however represented a serious break and after 1914 mass 
migration from Europe was no longer possible in its previous forms The 
reasons were threefold first countries which formerly sent and received 
migration eg Germany and the Habsburg Monarchy and the United States 
respectively became enemies during the Great War second state borders and 
state formations changed beyond recognition in and after 1918 third in the 
1920s strict immigration quotas were introduced in the United States by the 
Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and additional legislation which meant that the 
citizens of former empires successor states could no longer emigrate to the 
USA in the same numbers as before
