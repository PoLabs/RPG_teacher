The digital economy 
The disruption of the Fourth Industrial Revolution combined with the COVID19 pandemic has 
increased our need for agility adaptability and positive transformation As the global economy 
digitalises it is estimated that about 70 of new value created over the next ten years will be 
based on digitally enabled platform business models Charlton 2022 World Economic Forum
The economic activity will result from billions of everyday online connections between people 
businesses systems devices and data To sustain this hyperconnectivity the digital economy 
will need a solid backbone for the growing interconnection of people organisations and 
machines on the internet This is already taking shape and challenging conventional ideas of 
how businesses should be structured and operate from accepting payment methods to goods 
and services delivery and product experiences 
Cryptocurrency is changing how we transact and powering a new social economy to restore 
control to content creators and consumers Based on blockchain technology cryptocurrency 
is a decentralised digital ledger that records all exchanges and transactions in real time 
permanently and publicly 
One of the most wellknown blockchainbased currencies is Bitcoin When a user buys Bitcoin 
the transaction is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain and the record is distributed to thousands 
of individual computers across the globe Ethereum is another public blockchain and like 
Bitcoin is also transparent and programmable through a smart contract that essentially runs 
software routines automatically when conditions are met All transactions are available for 
anyone to view unlike traditional banking books
Blockchain is also the foundation of digital currency and nonfungible tokens NFTs Specific 
items like artwork and music on a blockchain are nonfungible tokens NFTs meaning they 
are unique and nontransferable Fungible items are currency like a dollar that is worth the 
same as another dollar and can be swapped with other dollars
Using a smart contract one user can purchase a digital artwork from a seller for a set amount 
of currency Once the buyer accepts the fee the exchange is completed using the blockchain 
If there is any dispute the amount paid can be verified on the public record 
More than the smart transactions the blockchain has everything to do with the metaverse it 
enables people to own digital assets and NFTs which ultimately interconnects the real world 
and the virtual world through one experience The blockchain is enabling seamless access from 
one world into the other using cryptocurrency for access by authenticating proof of ownership
