12 BORDERS

often lead us to neglect the blurriness of the borders in practice Maps imply 
homogeneity within a given area as well as sharp distinctions between a given 
area and its neighboursdelineations that were socially constructed and did 
not necessarily exist in practice
Changes in manners forms of behaviour religious beliefs and language also 
marked cultural borders for those travelling through Europe Longrunning 
differences in lifestyle and natural conditions were a complex background to 
the enduring existence of these cultural borders For example according to 
Burke 2008 between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries there was a 
cultural border in France which could be drawn as a diagonal line from St 
Malo in France to Geneva in Switzerland dividing a northeastern zone of 
higher literacy from a southwestern zone where fewer people were able to 
read
For a long time historians have treated the borders of the early modern 
period simply as barriers In recent decades this perception has changed to 
acknowledge their role as meetingplaces or zones of cultural interchange 
Both conceptions have their uses walls and barbed wire cannot keep out ideas 
but cultural barriers do exist There are at least some physical political or 
cultural obstacles including language and religion which slow down cultural 
movements and transfer or divert them into different channels However 
both borders and frontiers are also frequently zones of interaction for different 
groups This process sometimes produced border zones areas of reciprocal 
ethnic and cultural interaction and transmission in which distinctively hybrid 
identities might evolve This was the case in the HabsburgOttoman ie 
ChristianMuslim frontier of the early modern Balkans

Developments in the Early Modern Period
During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries confessional borders became 
more and more important because of the European Wars of Religion This 
development reached its climax in 1648 with the signing of the Peace of 
Westphalia which ended the Thirty Years War 16181648 The political 
consequencesthe emergence of the early modern state and the division of 
Europe along confessional lineschanged the nature of borders In many 
instances the monopoly of power in the hands of a single sovereign including 
the right to mint coins to make and enforce laws and to raise taxes replaced 
the dissipated power relations of the medieval feudal hierarchy Holding 
rights of jurisdiction over a community of subjects separated areas under the 
sovereign rule from those where these rights did not apply Besides other 
developments the religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries 
further increased the need for authoritative lines of demarcation
