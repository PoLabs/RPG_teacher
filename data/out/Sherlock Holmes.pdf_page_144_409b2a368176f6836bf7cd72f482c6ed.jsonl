The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet
of me to say so It is to that remark that she refers in
this note
 My dearest Uncle
 I feel that I have brought trouble upon
you and that if I had acted differently
this terrible misfortune might never have
occurred I cannot with this thought in
my mind ever again be happy under your
roof and I feel that I must leave you for
ever Do not worry about my future for
that is provided for and above all do not
search for me for it will be fruitless labour
and an illservice to me In life or in death
I am ever
  Your loving
 Mary
What could she mean by that note Mr Holmes
Do you think it points to suicide
No no nothing of the kind It is perhaps the
best possible solution I trust Mr Holder that you
are nearing the end of your troubles
Ha You say so You have heard something Mr
Holmes you have learned something Where are the
gems
You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an
excessive sum for them
I would pay ten
That would be unnecessary Three thousand will
cover the matter And there is a little reward I fancy
Have you your checkbook Here is a pen Better
make it out for 4000
With a dazed face the banker made out the re
quired check Holmes walked over to his desk took
out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in
it and threw it down upon the table
With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up
You have it he gasped
I am saved
I am
saved
The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief
had been and he hugged his recovered gems to his
bosom
There is one other thing you owe Mr Holder
said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly
Owe He caught up a pen Name the sum and
I will pay it
No the debt is not to me You owe a very humble
apology to that noble lad your son who has carried
himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my
own son do should I ever chance to have one
Then it was not Arthur who took them
I told you yesterday and I repeat today that it
was not
You are sure of it Then let us hurry to him at
once to let him know that the truth is known
He knows it already When I had cleared it all
up I had an interview with him and nding that he
would not tell me the story I told it to him on which
he had to confess that I was right and to add the very
few details which were not yet quite clear to me Your
news of this morning however may open his lips
For heavens sake tell me then what is this ex
traordinary mystery
I will do so and I will show you the steps by
which I reached it And let me say to you rst that
which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear
there has been an understanding between Sir George
Burnwell and your niece Mary They have now ed
together
My Mary Impossible
It is unfortunately more than possible it is cer
tain Neither you nor your son knew the true char
acter of this man when you admitted him into your
family circle He is one of the most dangerous men in
Englanda ruined gambler an absolutely desperate
villain a man without heart or conscience Your niece
knew nothing of such men When he breathed his
vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her
she attered herself that she alone had touched his
heart The devil knows best what he said but at least
she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing
him nearly every evening
I cannot and I will not believe it cried the
banker with an ashen face
I will tell you then what occurred in your house
last night Your niece when you had as she thought
gone to your room slipped down and talked to her
lover through the window which leads into the stable
lane His footmarks had pressed right through the
snow so long had he stood there She told him of
the coronet His wicked lust for gold kindled at the
news and he bent her to his will I have no doubt
that she loved you but there are women in whom
the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves and I
think that she must have been one She had hardly
listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly
and told you about one of the servants escapade with
her woodenlegged lover which was all perfectly true
