once known while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was
really his mother These things scared her a little and nobly anxious
to do her duty she tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting
them examination papers on it as like as possible to the ones she
used to do at school The other boys thought this awfully interesting
and insisted on joining and they made slates for themselves and sat
round the table writing and thinking hard about the questions she
had written on another slate and passed round They were the most
ordinary questionsWhat was the colour of Mothers eyes Which
was taller Father or Mother Was Mother blonde or brunette
Answer all three questions if possible A Write an essay of not
less than 40 words on How I spent my last Holidays or The
Characters of Father and Mother compared Only one of these to be
attempted Or 1 Describe Mothers laugh 2 Describe Fathers
laugh 3 Describe Mothers Party Dress 4 Describe the Kennel
and its Inmate
They were just everyday questions like these and when you could
not answer them you were told to make a cross and it was really
dreadful what a number of crosses even John made Of course the
only boy who replied to every question was Slightly and no one
could have been more hopeful of coming out first but his answers
were perfectly ridiculous and he really came out last a melancholy
thing
Peter did not compete For one thing he despised all mothers
except Wendy and for another he was the only boy on the island who
could neither write nor spell not the smallest word He was above all

By the way the questions were all written in the past tense What

that fascinated him enormously until he suddenly had no more
interest in it which as you have been told was what always
happened with his games It consisted in pretending not to have
adventures in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been
doing all their lives sitting on stools flinging balls in the air pushing
each other going out for walks and coming back without having
killed so much as a grizzly To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was
a great sight he could not help looking solemn at such times to sit
still seemed to him such a comic thing to do He boasted that he had
gone walking for the good of his health For several suns these were
the most novel of all adventures to him and John and Michael had to
pretend to be delighted also otherwise he would have treated them
severely
He often went out alone and when he came back you were never
absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not He might
have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it and then
when you went out you found the body and on the other hand he
might say a great deal about it and yet you could not find the body
Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged and then Wendy
cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water while he told a
dazzling tale But she was never quite sure you know There were
