Figure 2220 Salmonella enterica Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi the causative agent of Typhoid fever is a
Gramnegative rodshaped gamma proteobacterium Typhoid fever which is spread through feces causes intestinal
hemorrhage high fever delirium and dehydration Today between 16 and 33 million cases of this reemerging disease
occur annually resulting in over 200000 deaths Carriers of the disease can be asymptomatic In a famous case in the
early 1900s a cook named Mary Mallon Typhoid Mary unknowingly spread the disease to over fifty people three of
whom died Other serotypes of Salmonella cause food poisoning credit modification of work by NCI CDC
Bubonic Plagues
From 541 to 750 the Plague of Justinian an outbreak of what was likely bubonic plague eliminated onequarter
to onehalf of the human population in the eastern Mediterranean region The population in Europe dropped by
50 percent during this outbreak Astoundingly bubonic plague would strike Europe more than once
Bubonic plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis One of the most devastating pandemics attributed
to bubonic plague was the Black Death 1346 to 1361 It is thought to have originated in China and spread
along the Silk Road a network of land and sea trade routes to the Mediterranean region and Europe carried
by fleas living on black rats that were always present on ships The Black Death was probably named for the
tissue necrosis Figure 2221c that can be one of the symptoms The buboes of bubonic plague were painfully
swollen areas of lymphatic tissue A pneumonic form of the plague spread by the coughing and sneezing of
infected individuals spreads directly from human to human and can cause death within a week The pneumonic
form was responsible for the rapid spread of the Black Death in Europe The Black Death reduced the worlds
population from an estimated 450 million to about 350 to 375 million Bubonic plague struck London yet again
in the mid1600s Figure 2221 In modern times approximately 1000 to 3000 cases of plague arise globally
each year and a sylvatic form of plague carried by fleas living on rodents such as prairie dogs and black
footed ferrets infects 10 to 20 people annually in the American Southwest Although contracting bubonic plague
before antibiotics meant almost certain death the bacterium responds to several types of modern antibiotics
and mortality rates from plague are now very low
