Backendserverside languages and frameworks 
Serverside languages are the hidden web coding languages that determine how your website 
works and communicates with the web server and your computer
When choosing a serverside language you need to consider
Cost The cost varies depending on the language you choose for your web development 
project as some are more intricate than others the developer may charge more The language 
chosen may therefore directly influence the salary of the developer If information is processed 
where your website is housed as opposed to on the clients computer it increases the costs 
Some languages also require ongoing website management and maintenance which is an 
additional cost to consider 
Scalability When planning a project where scalability is a factorconsider whether there 
are developers readily available to write in this language Also find out if there are supporting 
libraries and frameworks available that may suit possible changes to your project 
Some of the most common and popular serverside languages include PHP JavaRuby NET 
and Python Ask your web developer to advise you on the best language for your specific project
