32 EMPIRE AND COLONIALISM
301
1556 on the Volga River gave the Tsar an opportunity to show his Christian 
credentials to the world represented in stone through the iconic St Basils 
Cathedral on Red Square More importantly this huge expansion turned 
Russia into a truly multiethnic and multireligious entity 
Russian imperialism in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries did not 
entail overseas colonies it was more about the advance of its border across 
the Eurasian landmass To achieve this Russian rulers struck deals with 
neighbouring powers and had new lines of fortification built at regular 
intervals They also adopted the techniques of some colonial empires as they 
started to colonise territories with their own carefully selected populations 
while displacing former inhabitants
By the eighteenth century colonial expansion was part of Russias formal 
rhetoric That Russia called itself imperiia from 1721 articulated both an 
accomplished fact and a growing ambition It was meant to show Russias 
European pedigree to the world And with Europe as a yardstick the tsars 
wanted colonies of their own The fact that Russian statesmen identified the 
Ural Mountains as the border between Europe and Asia in the 1730s established 
the land beyond the mountains as Russias own colonial Other Fur the soft 
gold of Siberia would become the symbol of the empires untapped riches 
with intellectuals soon hailing the unknown promised land as our Peru and 
our Mexico
