Chapter 1
1 Figure 16 1 C 2 F 3 A 4 B 5 D 6 E The original hypothesis is incorrect as the coffeemaker works when
plugged into the outlet Alternative hypotheses include that the toaster might be broken or that the toaster wasnt turned
on 3 Figure 116 Communities exist within populations which exist within ecosystems 4 B 6 D 8 C 10 C 12 B 14
D 16 Answers will vary but should apply the steps of the scientific method One possibility could be a car which
doesnt start The hypothesis could be that the car doesnt start because the battery is dead The experiment would be
to change the battery or to charge the battery and then check whether the car starts or not If it starts the problem was
due to the battery and the hypothesis is accepted 18 Answers will vary Topics that fall inside the area of biological
study include how diseases affect human bodies how pollution impacts a species habitat and how plants respond
to their environments Topics that fall outside of biology the study of life include how metamorphic rock is formed
and how planetary orbits function 20 Answers will vary Layers of sedimentary rock have order but are not alive
Technology is capable of regulation but is not of itself alive 22 During your walk you may begin to perspire which
cools your body and helps your body to maintain a constant internal temperature You might also become thirsty and
pause long enough for a cool drink which will help to restore the water lost during perspiration

C 12 D 14 Ionic bonds are created between ions The electrons are not shared between the atoms but rather are
associated more with one ion than the other Ionic bonds are strong bonds but are weaker than covalent bonds
meaning it takes less energy to break an ionic bond compared with a covalent one 16 Buffers absorb the free
hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions that result from chemical reactions Because they can bond these ions they
prevent increases or decreases in pH An example of a buffer system is the bicarbonate system in the human body
This system is able to absorb hydrogen and hydroxide ions to prevent changes in pH and keep cells functioning
properly 18 Carbon is unique and found in all living things because it can form up to four covalent bonds between
atoms or molecules These can be nonpolar or polar covalent bonds and they allow for the formation of long chains of
carbon molecules that combine to form proteins and DNA
Chapter 3
1 Figure 35 Glucose and galactose are aldoses Fructose is a ketose 3 Figure 333 Adenine is larger than cytosine
and will not be able to base pair properly with the guanine on the opposing strand This will cause the DNA to bulge
DNA repair enzymes may recognize the bulge and replace the incorrect nucleotide 4 C 6 A 8 D 10 B 12 D 14
C 16 B 18 C 20 C 21 Biological macromolecules are organic because they contain carbon 23 Amino acids can
be linked into long chains through condensation reactions One of the hydrogen atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom
of an amino acid reacts with the OH group attached to the terminal carbon on another amino acid Since both ends
of the molecule can participate in condensation reactions peptide bonds can be made in both directions to create
a long amino acid chain 25 The  14 glycosidic linkage in cellulose cannot be broken down by human digestive
enzymes Herbivores such as cows koalas and buffalos are able to digest grass that is rich in cellulose and use it as
a food source because bacteria and protists in their digestive systems especially in the rumen secrete the enzyme
cellulase Cellulases can break down cellulose into glucose monomers that can be used as an energy source by
the animal 27 Fat serves as a valuable way for animals to store energy It can also provide insulation Waxes can
protect plant leaves and mammalian fur from getting wet Phospholipids and steroids are important components of
animal cell membranes as well as plant fungal and bacterial membranes 29 Fats have a higher energy density
than carbohydrates averaging 9kcalgram versus 43kcalgram respectively Thus on a per gram basis more energy
can be stored in fats than can be stored in carbohydrates Additionally fats are packaged into spherical globules
to minimize interactions with the waterbased plasma membrane while glycogen is a large branched carbohydrate
that cannot be compacted for storage 31 A change in gene sequence can lead to a different amino acid being
added to a polypeptide chain instead of the normal one This causes a change in protein structure and function
For example in sickle cell anemia the hemoglobin  chain has a single amino acid substitutionthe amino acid
glutamic acid in position six is substituted by valine Because of this change hemoglobin molecules form aggregates
and the discshaped red blood cells assume a crescent shape which results in serious health problems 33 The
protein must form a channel in the plasma membrane that allows water into the cell since water cannot cross the
plasma membrane by itself Since aquaporins are embedded in the plasma membrane and connect with both the
intracellular and extracellular spaces it must be amphipathic like the plasma membrane The top and bottom of the
protein must contain charged or polar amino acids hydrophilic to interact with the aqueous environments The exterior
transmembrane region must contain nonpolar amino acids hydrophobic that can interact with the phospholipid tails
