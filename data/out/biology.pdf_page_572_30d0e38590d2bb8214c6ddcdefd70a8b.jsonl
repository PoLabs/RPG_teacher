have shapes that are roughly spherical such as those of poliovirus or herpesviruses Enveloped viruses have
membranes derived from the host cell that surrounds the capsids Animal viruses such as HIV are frequently
enveloped Headandtail viruses infect bacteria and have a head that is similar to icosahedral viruses and a tail
shaped like helical viruses
Many viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral
receptors For these viruses attachment is required for later penetration of the cell membrane only after
penetration takes place can the virus complete its replication inside the cell The receptors that viruses use are
molecules that are normally found on cell surfaces and have their own physiological functions It appears that
viruses have simply evolved to make use of these molecules for their own replication For example HIV uses
the CD4 molecule on T lymphocytes as one of its receptors Figure 214 CD4 is a type of molecule called a
cell adhesion molecule which functions to keep different types of immune cells in close proximity to each other
during the generation of a T lymphocyte immune response
Figure 214 A virus and its host receptor protein The HIV virus binds the CD4 receptor on the surface of human
cells CD4 receptors help white blood cells to communicate with other cells of the immune system when producing an
immune response credit modification of work by NIAID NIH
One of the most complex virions known the T4 bacteriophage which infects the Escherichia coli bacterium
has a tail structure that the virus uses to attach to host cells and a head structure that houses its DNA
Adenovirus a nonenveloped animal virus that causes respiratory illnesses in humans uses glycoprotein spikes
protruding from its capsomeres to attach to host cells Nonenveloped viruses also include those that cause polio
poliovirus plantar warts papillomavirus and hepatitis A hepatitis A virus
Enveloped virions such as the influenza virus consist of nucleic acid RNA in the case of influenza and capsid
proteins surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer envelope that contains virusencoded proteins Glycoproteins
