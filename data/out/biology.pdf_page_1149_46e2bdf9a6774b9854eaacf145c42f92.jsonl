Ruffini ending
part of the hearing apparatus that functions to transfer energy from the tympanum to the oval
window of the inner ear
proprioceptive stretch receptor that lies within a muscle and that shortens the muscle to an
optimal length for efficient contraction
also nearsightedness visual defect in which the image focus falls in front of the retina thereby making
images in the distance blurry but closeup images clear
neural processing of noxious such as damaging stimuli
airborne molecule that stimulates an olfactory receptor
sense of smell
neural structure in the vertebrate brain that receives signals from olfactory receptors
specialized tissue in the nasal cavity where olfactory receptors are located
dendrite of a specialized neuron
in the basilar membrane the site of the transduction of sound a mechanical wave to a neural
signal
one of the three bones of the middle ear
part of the ear that consists of the pinna ear canal and tympanum and which conducts sound waves
into the middle ear
thin diaphragm between the middle and inner ears that receives sound waves from contact with
the stapes bone of the middle ear
encapsulated mechanoreceptor in the skin that responds to deep pressure and vibration
one of the small bumplike projections from the tongue
individual interpretation of a sensation a brain function
substance released by an animal that can affect the physiology or behavior of other animals
cartilaginous outer ear
visual defect in which the image focus falls behind the retina thereby making images in the
distance clear but closeup images blurry caused by agebased changes in the lens
sense of limb position used to track kinesthesia
small opening though which light enters
receipt of a signal such as light or sound by sensory receptors
region in space in which a stimulus can activate a given sensory receptor
membrane potential in a sensory receptor in response to detection of a stimulus
layer of photoreceptive and supporting cells on the inner surface of the back of the eye
main photopigment in vertebrates
strongly photosensitive achromatic cylindrical neuron in the outer edges of the retina that detects dim light
and is used in peripheral and nighttime vision
also bulbous corpuscle slowlyadapting mechanoreceptor in the skin that responds to skin
