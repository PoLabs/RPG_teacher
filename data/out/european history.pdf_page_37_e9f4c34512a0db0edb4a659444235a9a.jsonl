11 IDEAS OF EUROPE

the other European powers coalesced to restore the balance But when 
they finally succeeded in 18141815 the victorious powers Russia Britain 
Austria and Prussia did not simply restore the statecentred system of the 
preNapoleonic period Instead the Treaty of Vienna that cemented the peace 
with a reestablished Kingdom of France produced a new vision of Europe 
in which the traditional ideal of a balance of power was combined with a 
shared fivepower hegemony over the minor powers They would act in 
concert on the basis of a novel security culture in which international peace 
was tied to legitimist monarchical orders within individual states in breach 
of the Westphalian state sovereignty that precluded this kind of meddling 
with a countrys domestic affairs On this basis the five now took collective 
responsibility over European stability and prosperity
With greater emphasis on European cooperation came the increased 
exclusion of nonEuropean nonChristian powers The Ottoman Empire 
was neither invited to the Congress of Vienna nor was its territorial integrity 
respected afterwards for example when European powers forced it to accept 
Greek independence in the 1820s The powers also stopped recognising the 
Barbary Pirates on Africas WestMediterranean shore as sovereign states 
Instead Europeans waged war on what they now saw as illegitimate extra
legal entities and began to subject them to colonial submission and exploitation
Europe as a Shared Civilisation
During a business trip through Italy in 1859 the Swiss businessman Henry 
Dunant 18281910 became a witness to the horrors of the Battle of Solferino 
in the Second Italian War of Independence Dunants experiences inspired him 
to write the book A Memory of Solferino 1862 In his pamphlet which was 
published and circulated throughout Europe Dunant called for the creation of 
a transnational voluntary organisation to aid those affected by war and conflict 
based on Christian and humanitarian values His efforts ultimately led to the 
foundation of the International Committee for Relief for the Wounded later 
renamed the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC Dunant and 
subsequently the ICRC envisioned Europe as the central stage for transnational 
cooperation based on commonly shared values of humanity and civilisation 
This vision was put to paper in 1864 when European states ratified the 
demands of the ICRC in the First Geneva Convention which codified rules for 
the protection of the victims of armed conflicts 
However many of the members of the ICRC were convinced of the 
superiority of European civilisation They used this narrative to excuse 
colonial violence as civilising missions Hence the ICRCs vision of Europe 
in the nineteenth century was twofold on the one hand Europeans were 
believed to share the same values that made transnational cooperation possible
