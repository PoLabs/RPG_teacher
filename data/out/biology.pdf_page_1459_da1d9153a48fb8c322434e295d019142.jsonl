reinforcement often a reward such as food or some type of punishment respectively In this way the animal
is conditioned to associate a type of behavior with the punishment or reward and over time can be induced
to perform behaviors that they would not have done in the wild such as the tricks dolphins perform at marine
amusement park shows Figure 4541
Figure 4541 The training of dolphins by rewarding them with food is an example of positive reinforcement operant

Cognitive Learning
Classical and operant conditioning are inefficient ways for humans and other intelligent animals to learn Some
primates including humans are able to learn by imitating the behavior of others and by taking instructions The
development of complex language by humans has made cognitive learning the manipulation of information
using the mind the most prominent method of human learning In fact that is how students are learning
right now by reading this book As students read they can make mental images of objects or organisms
and imagine changes to them or behaviors by them and anticipate the consequences In addition to visual
processing cognitive learning is also enhanced by remembering past experiences touching physical objects
hearing sounds tasting food and a variety of other sensorybased inputs Cognitive learning is so powerful that
it can be used to understand conditioning in detail In the reverse scenario conditioning cannot help someone
learn about cognition
Classic work on cognitive learning was done by Wolfgang Khler with chimpanzees He demonstrated that these
animals were capable of abstract thought by showing that they could learn how to solve a puzzle When a
banana was hung in their cage too high for them to reach and several boxes were placed randomly on the floor
some of the chimps were able to stack the boxes one on top of the other climb on top of them and get the
banana This implies that they could visualize the result of stacking the boxes even before they had performed
the action This type of learning is much more powerful and versatile than conditioning
Cognitive learning is not limited to primates although they are the most efficient in using it Maze running
experiments done with rats by HC Blodgett in the 1920s were the first to show cognitive skills in a simple
mammal The motivation for the animals to work their way through the maze was a piece of food at its end In
these studies the animals in Group I were run in one trial per day and had food available to them each day
on completion of the run Figure 4542 Group II rats were not fed in the maze for the first six days and then
subsequent runs were done with food for several days after Group III rats had food available on the third day
and every day thereafter The results were that the control rats Group I learned quickly and figured out how to
run the maze in seven days Group III did not learn much during the three days without food but rapidly caught
up to the control group when given the food reward Group II learned very slowly for the six days with no reward
to motivate them and they did not begin to catch up to the control group until the day food was given and then
it took two days longer to learn the maze
