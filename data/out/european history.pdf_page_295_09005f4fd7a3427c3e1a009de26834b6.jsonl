Introduction 
The nineteenth century saw the consecration of the nationstate as a model 
for political and territorial organisation in Europe It emerged out of long
term structural developments commonly known as nation and statebuilding 
processes But what came first in historical terms the nation or the state Were 
state structures built around alreadyexisting nations Or to the contrary are 
national identities the products of action taken by state institutions in order to 
win the loyalty of the citizens that inhabit a given territory This is a difficult 
question to which scholars have given different answers 
A New Model for Political Organisation in Europe The 
Nationstate 
The period of transition known as the Age of Revolution ca 17891848 is 
a crucial moment both for the history of the nation and that of the state For 
some historians such as Eric Hobsbawm or Ernest Gellner modern states and 
nations emerged as new entities during liberal revolutions and in connection 
with the parallel rise of modern capitalism From this point of view declarations 
of national sovereignty became a common feature of European liberal 
revolutions after 1789 from the moment that the French National Assembly 
was formed and declared itself competent to provide the monarchy with a 
new constitution as the true representative of the national interest Thus 
national sovereignty became the main source of political legitimation for state 
institutions in the liberal age Article Three of the 1812 Spanish Constitution
