Figure 337 Squamous epithelia cells a have a slightly irregular shape and a small centrally located nucleus These
cells can be stratified into layers as in b this human cervix specimen credit b modification of work by Ed Uthman
scalebar data from Matt Russell
Figure 337a illustrates a layer of squamous cells with their membranes joined together to form an epithelium
Image Figure 337b illustrates squamous epithelial cells arranged in stratified layers where protection is needed
on the body from outside abrasion and damage This is called a stratified squamous epithelium and occurs in
the skin and in tissues lining the mouth and vagina
Cuboidal Epithelia
Cuboidal epithelial cells shown in Figure 338 are cubeshaped with a single central nucleus They are most
commonly found in a single layer representing a simple epithelia in glandular tissues throughout the body where
they prepare and secrete glandular material They are also found in the walls of tubules and in the ducts of the
kidney and liver
Figure 338 Simple cuboidal epithelial cells line tubules in the mammalian kidney where they are involved in filtering
the blood
Columnar Epithelia
Columnar epithelial cells are taller than they are wide they resemble a stack of columns in an epithelial layer
and are most commonly found in a singlelayer arrangement The nuclei of columnar epithelial cells in the
digestive tract appear to be lined up at the base of the cells as illustrated in Figure 339 These cells absorb
material from the lumen of the digestive tract and prepare it for entry into the body through the circulatory and
lymphatic systems
