Its the girls bathroom Harry gasped
Hermione they said together
It was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have
Wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key
fumbling in their panic Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if
she was about to faint The troll was advancing on her knocking the
sinks off the walls as it went
Confuse it Harry said desperately to Ron and seizing a tap he
threw it as hard as he could against the wall
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione It lumbered around blinking
stupidly to see what had made the noise Its mean little eyes saw
Harry It hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it
went
Oy peabrain yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber and he
threw a metal pipe at it The troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe
hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning
its ugly snout toward Ron instead giving Harry time to run around it
Come on run run Harry yelled at Hermione trying to pull her toward
the door but she couldnt move she was still flat against the wall
her mouth open with terror
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk It
roared again and started toward Ron who was nearest and had no way to
escape
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid He
took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the
trolls neck from behind The troll couldnt feel Harry hanging there
but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its
nose and Harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped  it
had gone straight up one of the trolls nostrils
Howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with Harry
clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him
