Web and Network Models
Recognizing the importance of HGT especially in prokaryote evolution has caused some to propose
abandoning the classic tree of life model In 1999 W Ford Doolittle proposed a phylogenetic model that
resembles a web or a network more than a tree The hypothesis is that eukaryotes evolved not from a single
prokaryotic ancestor but from a pool of many species that were sharing genes by HGT mechanisms As
Figure 2016a shows some individual prokaryotes were responsible for transferring the bacteria that caused
mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes whereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave
rise to chloroplasts Scientists often call this model the  web of life In an effort to save the tree analogy some
have proposed using the Ficus tree Figure 2016b with its multiple trunks as a phylogenetic way to represent
a diminished evolutionary role for HGT
