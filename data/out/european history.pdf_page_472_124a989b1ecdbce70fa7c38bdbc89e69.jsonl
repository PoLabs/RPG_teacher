dependence on complex technological systems
Science and Engineering
The beginning of the First World War marked a break in the development of the 
sciences and the humanities Many researchers on both sides rapidly endorsed 
nationalist rhetoric using achievements as well as traditions for propaganda 
but it was the physical and the chemical sciences in particular that became 
actively involved in warfare While chlorine gas was originally intended for 
use in the trenches of Belgium and France in 1915 to remedy shortages of 
ammunition specific chemical weapons were subsequently developed and 
have since been used repeatedly 
The Second World War reinforced this picture the development of airplanes 
and rocketry should be mentioned alongside secretive projects to develop 
an atomic bomb which used the skills and hard work of a great number of 
physicists chemists and engineers While the American Manhattan Project 
represented the largest and most consequential of these projects Nazi Germany 
and the Soviet Union pursued these goals as well Where gas warfare relied 
on the knowledge of organic chemistry and physiology the atomic bomb was 
based on the discovery of radioactivity Marie Skodowska Curie insights 
into the makeup of atoms and quantum mechanics Niels Bohr as well as 
Albert Einsteins relativity theory 
Meanwhile biologys fall from grace in the period up to 1945 was eugenics 
Research to improve humankinds genetic makeup was conceived of as a 
strategy to cope with the perceived degradation of human beings due to 
social problems of industrialisation and urbanisation alcoholism neglect 
prostitution It rapidly became fused with racist theories from anthropology 
often related to colonialism as well as longstanding prejudices against Jewish 
or Roma Europeans among others Eugenic thought and practice including 
sterilisation programmes were widespread in many countries and endorsed 
by various political actors during the 1920s and 1930s but the field reached 
a completely different dimension under German National Socialism after 
1933 Antisemitic legislation and the murder of asylum inmates display clear 
continuities with the Holocaust which many German scientists and medical 
doctors approved of carried out actively or used as an opportunity for their 
research
After 1918 and 1945 the active enrolment of science in discrimination 
war and genocide provoked widespread disillusionment and doubt over its
