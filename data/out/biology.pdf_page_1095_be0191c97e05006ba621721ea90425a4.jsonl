Figure 3518 Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors can initiate two different forms of synaptic plasticity
longterm potentiation LTP and longterm depression LTD LTP arises when a single synapse is repeatedly
stimulated This stimulation causes a calcium and CaMKIIdependent cellular cascade which results in the insertion of
more AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane The next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic cell
it will bind to both NMDA and the newly inserted AMPA receptors thus depolarizing the membrane more efficiently LTD
occurs when few glutamate molecules bind to NMDA receptors at a synapse due to a low firing rate of the presynaptic
neuron The calcium that does flow through NMDA receptors initiates a different calcineurin and protein phosphatase
1dependent cascade which results in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors This makes the postsynaptic neuron less
responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron
353  The Central Nervous System
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify the spinal cord cerebral lobes and other brain areas on a diagram of the brain

Describe the basic functions of the spinal cord cerebral lobes and other brain areas
The central nervous system CNS is made up of the brain a part of which is shown in Figure 3519 and
spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges from the Greek word
for membrane The outermost layer is the dura mater Latin for hard mother As the Latin suggests the
primary function for this thick layer is to protect the brain and spinal cord The dura mater also contains veinlike
structures that carry blood from the brain back to the heart The middle layer is the weblike arachnoid mater
The last layer is the pia mater Latin for soft mother which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal
cord like plastic wrap The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid CSF
CSF is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluidfilled compartments in the CNS called ventricles
The brain floats in CSF which acts as a cushion and shock absorber and makes the brain neutrally buoyant
CSF also functions to circulate chemical substances throughout the brain and into the spinal cord
