Figure 2216 Cell walls in Grampositive and Gramnegative bacteria Bacteria are divided into two major groups
Gram positive and Gram negative Both groups have a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan in Grampositive
bacteria the wall is thick whereas in Gramnegative bacteria the wall is thin In Gramnegative bacteria the cell
wall is surrounded by an outer membrane that contains lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins Porins are proteins
in this cell membrane that allow substances to pass through the outer membrane of Gramnegative bacteria In
Grampositive bacteria lipoteichoic acid anchors the cell wall to the cell membrane credit modification of work

Which of the following statements is true
a
Grampositive bacteria have a single cell wall anchored to the cell membrane by lipoteichoic acid
b
Porins allow entry of substances into both Grampositive and Gramnegative bacteria
c
The cell wall of Gramnegative bacteria is thick and the cell wall of Grampositive bacteria is thin
d
Gramnegative bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan whereas Grampositive bacteria have
a cell wall made of lipoteichoic acid
Archaean cell walls do not have peptidoglycan There are four different types of archaean cell walls One type
is composed of pseudopeptidoglycan which is similar to peptidoglycan in morphology but contains different
sugars in the polysaccharide chain The other three types of cell walls are composed of polysaccharides
glycoproteins or pure protein Other differences between Bacteria and Archaea are seen in Table 222 Note
that features related to DNA replication transcription and translation in Archaea are similar to those seen in
eukaryotes
