variation
vestigial structure
vicariance
genetic differences among individuals in a population
physical structure present in an organism but that has no apparent function and appears to
be from a functional structure in a distant ancestor
allopatric speciation that occurs when something in the environment separates organisms of the
same species into separate groups
CHAPTER SUMMARY
181 Understanding Evolution
Evolution is the process of adaptation through mutation which allows more desirable characteristics to pass to
the next generation Over time organisms evolve more characteristics that are beneficial to their survival For
living organisms to adapt and change to environmental pressures genetic variation must be present With
genetic variation individuals have differences in form and function that allow some to survive certain conditions
better than others These organisms pass their favorable traits to their offspring Eventually environments
change and what was once a desirable advantageous trait may become an undesirable trait and organisms
may further evolve Evolution may be convergent with similar traits evolving in multiple species or divergent
with diverse traits evolving in multiple species that came from a common ancestor We can observe evidence of
evolution by means of DNA code and the fossil record and also by the existence of homologous and vestigial
structures
182 Formation of New Species
Speciation occurs along two main pathways geographic separation allopatric speciation and through
mechanisms that occur within a shared habitat sympatric speciation Both pathways isolate a population
reproductively in some form Mechanisms of reproductive isolation act as barriers between closely related
species enabling them to diverge and exist as genetically independent species Prezygotic barriers block
reproduction prior to formation of a zygote whereas postzygotic barriers block reproduction after fertilization
occurs For a new species to develop something must cause a breach in the reproductive barriers Sympatric
speciation can occur through errors in meiosis that form gametes with extra chromosomes polyploidy
Autopolyploidy occurs within a single species whereas allopolyploidy occurs between closely related species
183 Reconnection and Speciation Rates
Speciation is not a precise division overlap between closely related species can occur in areas called hybrid
zones Organisms reproduce with other similar organisms The fitness of these hybrid offspring can affect the
two species evolutionary path Scientists propose two models for the rate of speciation one model illustrates
how a species can change slowly over time The other model demonstrates how change can occur quickly from
a parent generation to a new species Both models continue to follow natural selection patterns
