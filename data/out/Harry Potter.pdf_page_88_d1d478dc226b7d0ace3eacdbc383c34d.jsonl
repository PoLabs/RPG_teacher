Youd better hurry up and put your robes on Ive just been up to the
front to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there You havent
been fighting have you Youll be in trouble before we even get there
Scabbers has been fighting not us said Ron scowling at her Would
you mind leaving while we change
All right  I only came in here because people outside are behaving
very childishly racing up and down the corridors said Hermione in a
sniffy voice And youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you
know
Ron glared at her as she left Harry peered out of the window It was
getting dark He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple
sky The train did seem to be slowing down
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes
Rons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath
them
A voice echoed through the train We will be reaching Hogwarts in five
minutes time Please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken
to the school separately
Harrys stomach lurched with nerves and Ron he saw looked pale under
his freckles They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and
joined the crowd thronging the corridor
The train slowed right down and finally stopped People pushed their way
toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform Harry shivered in
the cold night air Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the
students and Harry heard a familiar voice Firs years Firs years
over here All right there Harry
Hagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads
Cmon follow me  any more firs years Mind yer step now Firs
years follow me
Slipping and stumbling they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a
steep narrow path It was so dark on either side of them that Harry
thought there must be thick trees there Nobody spoke much Neville the
boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice
