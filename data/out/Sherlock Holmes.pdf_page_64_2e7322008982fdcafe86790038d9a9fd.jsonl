The Five Orange Pips
that the letters are all practical jokes and that the
deaths of my relations were really accidents as the
jury stated and were not to be connected with the
warnings
Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air In
credible imbecility he cried
They have however allowed me a policeman
who may remain in the house with me
Has he come with you tonight
No His orders were to stay in the house
Again Holmes raved in the air
Why did you come to me he cried and above
all why did you not come at once
I did not know It was only today that I spoke
to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was ad
vised by him to come to you
It is really two days since you had the letter We
should have acted before this You have no further
evidence I suppose than that which you have placed
before usno suggestive detail which might help
us
There is one thing said John Openshaw He
rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a
piece of discoloured bluetinted paper he laid it out
upon the table I have some remembrance said he
that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I
observed that the small unburned margins which lay
amid the ashes were of this particular colour I found
this single sheet upon the oor of his room and I
am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers
which has perhaps uttered out from among the oth
ers and in that way has escaped destruction Beyond
the mention of pips I do not see that it helps us much
I think myself that it is a page from some private
diary The writing is undoubtedly my uncles
Holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over
the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge
that it had indeed been torn from a book It was
headed March 1869 and beneath were the follow
ing enigmatical notices
4th Hudson came Same old platform
7th Set the pips on McCauley Paramore and John
Swain of St Augustine
9th McCauley cleared
10th John Swain cleared
12th Visited Paramore All well
Thank you said Holmes folding up the paper
and returning it to our visitor And now you must
on no account lose another instant We cannot spare
time even to discuss what you have told me You
must get home instantly and act
What shall I do
There is but one thing to do It must be done at
once You must put this piece of paper which you
have shown us into the brass box which you have
described You must also put in a note to say that all
the other papers were burned by your uncle and that
this is the only one which remains You must assert
that in such words as will carry conviction with them
Having done this you must at once put the box out
upon the sundial as directed Do you understand
Entirely
Do not think of revenge or anything of the sort
at present I think that we may gain that by means of
the law but we have our web to weave while theirs
is already woven The rst consideration is to remove
the pressing danger which threatens you The second
is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty
parties
I thank you said the young man rising and
pulling on his overcoat You have given me fresh life
and hope I shall certainly do as you advise
Do not lose an instant And above all take care
of yourself in the meanwhile for I do not think that
there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very
real and imminent danger How do you go back
By train from Waterloo
It is not yet nine The streets will be crowded so
I trust that you may be in safety And yet you cannot
guard yourself too closely
I am armed
That is well Tomorrow I shall set to work upon
your case
I shall see you at Horsham then
No your secret lies in London It is there that I
shall seek it
Then I shall call upon you in a day or in two
days with news as to the box and the papers I shall
take your advice in every particular He shook hands
with us and took his leave Outside the wind still
screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against
the windows This strange wild story seemed to have
come to us from amid the mad elementsblown in
upon us like a sheet of seaweed in a galeand now
to have been reabsorbed by them once more
