Somatosensory Receptors
Sensory receptors are classified into five categories mechanoreceptors thermoreceptors proprioceptors pain
receptors and chemoreceptors These categories are based on the nature of stimuli each receptor class
transduces What is commonly referred to as touch involves more than one kind of stimulus and more than one
kind of receptor Mechanoreceptors in the skin are described as encapsulated that is surrounded by a capsule
or unencapsulated a group that includes free nerve endings A free nerve ending as its name implies is an
unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron Free nerve endings are the most common nerve endings in skin
and they extend into the middle of the epidermis Free nerve endings are sensitive to painful stimuli to hot and
cold and to light touch They are slow to adjust to a stimulus and so are less sensitive to abrupt changes in
stimulation
There are three classes of mechanoreceptors tactile proprioceptors and baroreceptors Mechanoreceptors
sense stimuli due to physical deformation of their plasma membranes They contain mechanically gated ion
channels whose gates open or close in response to pressure touch stretching and sound There are four
primary tactile mechanoreceptors in human skin Merkels disks Meissners corpuscles Ruffini endings and
Pacinian corpuscles two are located toward the surface of the skin and two are located deeper A fifth type of
mechanoreceptor Krause end bulbs are found only in specialized regions Merkels disks shown in Figure
365 are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis both in skin that has hair and on
glabrous skin that is the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers the soles of the feet and the lips of
humans and other primates Merkels disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips They are slow
adapting encapsulated nerve endings and they respond to light touch Light touch also known as discriminative
touch is a light pressure that allows the location of a stimulus to be pinpointed The receptive fields of Merkels
disks are small with welldefined borders That makes them finely sensitive to edges and they come into use in
tasks such as typing on a keyboard
