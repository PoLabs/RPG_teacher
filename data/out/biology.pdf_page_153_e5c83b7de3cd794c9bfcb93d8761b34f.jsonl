FUNCTION OF PLASMA
MEMBRANES
Figure 51 Despite its seeming hustle and bustle Grand Central Station functions with a high level of organization
People and objects move from one location to another they cross or are contained within certain boundaries and they
provide a constant flow as part of larger activity Analogously a plasma membranes functions involve movement within
the cell and across boundaries activities credit modification of work by Randy LeMoine

Introduction
The plasma membrane the cell membrane has many functions but the most basic one is to define the cells
borders and keep the cell functional The plasma membrane is selectively permeable This means that the
membrane allows some materials to freely enter or leave the cell while other materials cannot move freely but
require a specialized structure and occasionally even energy investment for crossing
