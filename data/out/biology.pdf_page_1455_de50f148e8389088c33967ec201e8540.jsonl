Altruistic Behaviors
Behaviors that lower the fitness of the individual but increase the fitness of another individual are termed
altruistic Examples of such behaviors are seen widely across the animal kingdom Social insects such as worker
bees have no ability to reproduce yet they maintain the queen so she can populate the hive with her offspring
Meerkats keep a sentry standing guard to warn the rest of the colony about intruders even though the sentry is
putting itself at risk Wolves and wild dogs bring meat to pack members not present during a hunt Lemurs take
care of infants unrelated to them Although on the surface these behaviors appear to be altruistic the truth may
not be so simple
There has been much discussion over why altruistic behaviors exist Do these behaviors lead to overall
evolutionary advantages for their species Do they help the altruistic individual pass on its own genes And what
about such activities between unrelated individuals One explanation for altruistictype behaviors is found in the
genetics of natural selection In the 1976 book The Selfish Gene scientist Richard Dawkins attempted to explain
many seemingly altruistic behaviors from the viewpoint of the gene itself Although a gene obviously cannot be
selfish in the human sense it may appear that way if the sacrifice of an individual benefits related individuals that
share genes that are identical by descent present in relatives because of common lineage Mammal parents
make this sacrifice to take care of their offspring Emperor penguins migrate miles in harsh conditions to bring
food back for their young Selfish gene theory has been controversial over the years and is still discussed among
scientists in related fields
Even lessrelated individuals those with less genetic identity than that shared by parent and offspring benefit
from seemingly altruistic behavior The activities of social insects such as bees wasps ants and termites are
good examples Sterile workers in these societies take care of the queen because they are closely related to it
and as the queen has offspring she is passing on genes from the workers indirectly Thus it is of fitness benefit
for the worker to maintain the queen without having any direct chance of passing on its genes due to its sterility
The lowering of individual fitness to enhance the reproductive fitness of a relative and thus ones inclusive fitness
evolves through kin selection This phenomenon can explain many superficially altruistic behaviors seen in
animals However these behaviors may not be truly defined as altruism in these cases because the actor is
actually increasing its own fitness either directly through its own offspring or indirectly through the inclusive
fitness it gains through relatives that share genes with it
Unrelated individuals may also act altruistically to each other and this seems to defy the selfish gene
explanation An example of this observed in many monkey species where a monkey will present its back to an
unrelated monkey to have that individual pick the parasites from its fur After a certain amount of time the roles
are reversed and the first monkey now grooms the second monkey Thus there is reciprocity in the behavior
Both benefit from the interaction and their fitness is raised more than if neither cooperated nor if one cooperated
and the other did not cooperate This behavior is still not necessarily altruism as the giving behavior of the
actor is based on the expectation that it will be the receiver of the behavior in the future termed reciprocal
altruism Reciprocal altruism requires that individuals repeatedly encounter each other often the result of living
in the same social group and that cheaters those that never give back are punished
Evolutionary game theory a modification of classical game theory in mathematics has shown that many of
these socalled altruistic behaviors are not altruistic at all The definition of pure altruism based on human
behavior is an action that benefits another without any direct benefit to oneself Most of the behaviors previously
described do not seem to satisfy this definition and game theorists are good at finding selfish components in
them Others have argued that the terms selfish and altruistic should be dropped completely when discussing
animal behavior as they describe human behavior and may not be directly applicable to instinctual animal
activity What is clear though is that heritable behaviors that improve the chances of passing on ones genes
or a portion of ones genes are favored by natural selection and will be retained in future generations as long
