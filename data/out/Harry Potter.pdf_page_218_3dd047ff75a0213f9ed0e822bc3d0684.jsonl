You cant go out said Neville youll be caught again Gryffindor
will be in even more trouble
You dont understand said Harry this is important
But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate
I wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the
portrait hole Ill  Ill fight you
Neville Ron exploded get away from that hole and dont be an idiot

Dont you call me an idiot said Neville I dont think you should be
breaking any more rules And you were the one who told me to stand up to
people
Yes but not to us said Ron in exasperation Neville you dont know
what youre doing
He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad who leapt
out of sight
Go on then try and hit me said Neville raising his fists Im
ready
Harry turned to Hermione
Do something he said desperately
Hermione stepped forward
Neville she said Im really really sorry about this
She raised her wand
Petrificus Totalus she cried pointing it at Neville
Nevilles arms snapped to his sides His legs sprang together His whole
body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face
stiff as a board
