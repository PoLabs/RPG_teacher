Figure 2411 Chytrids The chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is seen in these light micrographs as transparent
spheres growing on a a freshwater arthropod water mite and b algae This chytrid causes skin diseases in many
species of amphibians resulting in species decline and extinction credit modification of work by Johnson ML Speare

Zygomycota The Conjugated Fungi
The zygomycetes are a relatively small group of fungi belonging to the Phylum Zygomycota They include
the familiar bread mold Rhizopus stolonifer which rapidly propagates on the surfaces of breads fruits and
vegetables Most species are saprobes living off decaying organic material a few are parasites particularly
of insects Zygomycetes play a considerable commercial role For example the metabolic products of some
species of Rhizopus are intermediates in the synthesis of semisynthetic steroid hormones
Zygomycetes have a thallus of coenocytic hyphae in which the nuclei are haploid when the organism is in the
vegetative stage The fungi usually reproduce asexually by producing sporangiospores Figure 2412 The
black tips of bread mold are the swollen sporangia packed with black spores Figure 2413 When spores
land on a suitable substrate they germinate and produce a new mycelium Sexual reproduction starts when
environmental conditions become unfavorable Two opposing mating strains type  and type  must be in close
proximity for gametangia from the hyphae to be produced and fuse leading to karyogamy Each zygospore
can contain several diploid nuclei The developing diploid zygospores have thick coats that protect them from
desiccation and other hazards They may remain dormant until environmental conditions are favorable When
the zygospore germinates it undergoes meiosis and produces haploid spores which will in turn grow into a
new organism This form of sexual reproduction in fungi is called conjugation although it differs markedly from
conjugation in bacteria and protists giving rise to the name conjugated fungi
