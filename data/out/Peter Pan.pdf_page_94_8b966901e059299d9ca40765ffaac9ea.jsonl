But if I had been a weak man he said Good heavens if I had
been a weak man
And George she said timidly you are as full of remorse as
ever arent you
Full of remorse as ever dearest See my punishment living in a
kennel
But it is punishment isnt it George You are sure you are not
enjoying it
My love
You may be sure she begged his pardon and then feeling drowsy
he curled round in the kennel
Wont you play me to sleep he asked on the nursery piano
and as she was crossing to the daynursery he added thoughtlessly
And shut that window I feel a draught
O George never ask me to do that The window must always be
left open for them always always
Now it was his turn to beg her pardon and she went into the day
nursery and played and soon he was asleep and while he slept
Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room
Oh no We have written it so because that was the charming
arrangement planned by them before we left the ship but something
must have happened since then for it is not they who have flown in
it is Peter and Tinker Bell
Peters first words tell all
Quick Tink he whispered close the window bar it Thats
right Now you and I must get away by the door and when Wendy
comes she will think her mother has barred her out and she will
have to go back with me
Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me why when Peter
had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave
Tink to escort the children to the mainland This trick had been in his
head all the time
Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee
then he peeped into the daynursery to see who was playing He
whispered to Tink Its Wendys mother She is a pretty lady but not
so pretty as my mother Her mouth is full of thimbles but not so full
as my mothers was
Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother but he
sometimes bragged about her
He did not know the tune which was Home Sweet Home but
he knew it was saying Come back Wendy Wendy Wendy and he
cried exultantly You will never see Wendy again lady for the
window is barred
He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped and now he
saw that Mrs Darling had laid her head on the box and that two
tears were sitting on her eyes
She wants me to unbar the window thought Peter but I wont
not I
He peeped again and the tears were still there or another two had
taken their place
