Pacini corpuscles are found in both glabrous
and hairy skin
b
Merkels disks are abundant on the
fingertips and lips

2 Figure 3614 Cochlear implants can restore
hearing in people who have a nonfunctional cochlea
The implant consists of a microphone that picks up
sound A speech processor selects sounds in the
range of human speech and a transmitter converts
these sounds to electrical impulses which are then
sent to the auditory nerve Which of the following
types of hearing loss would not be restored by a
cochlear implant
a
Hearing loss resulting from absence or loss
of hair cells in the organ of Corti
b
Hearing loss resulting from an abnormal
auditory nerve
c
Hearing loss resulting from fracture of the
cochlea
d
Hearing loss resulting from damage to
bones of the middle ear
3 Figure 3618 Which of the following statements
about the human eye is false
a
Rods detect color while cones detect only
shades of gray
b
When light enters the retina it passes the
ganglion cells and bipolar cells before
reaching photoreceptors at the rear of the
eye
c
The iris adjusts the amount of light coming
into the eye
d
The cornea is a protective layer on the front
of the eye
