Introduction
Genetics is the study of heredity Johann Gregor Mendel set the framework for genetics long before
chromosomes or genes had been identified at a time when meiosis was not well understood Mendel selected
a simple biological system and conducted methodical quantitative analyses using large sample sizes Because
of Mendels work the fundamental principles of heredity were revealed We now know that genes carried
on chromosomes are the basic functional units of heredity with the capability to be replicated expressed or
mutated Today the postulates put forth by Mendel form the basis of classical or Mendelian genetics Not all
genes are transmitted from parents to offspring according to Mendelian genetics but Mendels experiments
serve as an excellent starting point for thinking about inheritance
