Figure 427 The extracellular matrix consists of a network of proteins and carbohydrates
Cells have protein receptors on their plasma membranes extracellular surfaces When a molecule within the
matrix binds to the receptor it changes the receptors molecular structure The receptor in turn changes
the microfilaments conformation positioned just inside the plasma membrane These conformational changes
induce chemical signals inside the cell that reach the nucleus and turn on or off the transcription of specific
DNA sections which affects the associated protein production thus changing the activities within the cell
Blood clotting provides an example of the extracellular matrixs role in cell communication When the cells lining
a blood vessel are damaged they display a protein receptor which we call tissue factor When tissue factor
binds with another factor in the extracellular matrix it causes platelets to adhere to the damaged blood vessels
wall stimulates the adjacent smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel to contract thus constricting the blood
vessel and initiates a series of steps that stimulate the platelets to produce clotting factors
Intercellular Junctions
Cells can also communicate with each other via direct contact or intercellular junctions There are differences
in the ways that plant and animal and fungal cells communicate Plasmodesmata are junctions between plant
cells whereas animal cell contacts include tight junctions gap junctions and desmosomes
Plasmodesmata
In general long stretches of the plasma membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another
because the cell wall that surrounds each cell separates them Figure 48 How then can a plant transfer water
and other soil nutrients from its roots through its stems and to its leaves Such transport uses the vascular
tissues xylem and phloem primarily There also exist structural modifications which we call plasmodesmata
singular  plasmodesma Numerous channels that pass between adjacent plant cells cell walls connect their
cytoplasm and enable transport of materials from cell to cell and thus throughout the plant Figure 428
