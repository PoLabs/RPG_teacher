they absorbed but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on In 1868 Mendel became
abbot of the monastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties He was not recognized
for his extraordinary scientific contributions during his lifetime In fact it was not until 1900 that his work was
rediscovered reproduced and revitalized by scientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of
heredity
Mendels Model System
Mendels seminal work was accomplished using the garden pea Pisum sativum to study inheritance This
species naturally selffertilizes such that pollen encounters ova within individual flowers The flower petals
remain sealed tightly until after pollination preventing pollination from other plants The result is highly inbred
or truebreeding pea plants These are plants that always produce offspring that look like the parent By
experimenting with truebreeding pea plants Mendel avoided the appearance of unexpected traits in offspring
that might occur if the plants were not true breeding The garden pea also grows to maturity within one season
meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short time Finally large quantities of
garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously allowing Mendel to conclude that his results did not come about
simply by chance
Mendelian Crosses
Mendel performed hybridizations which involve mating two truebreeding individuals that have different traits
In the pea which is naturally selfpollinating this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a
mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety In plants
pollen carries the male gametes sperm to the stigma a sticky organ that traps pollen and allows the sperm
to move down the pistil to the female gametes ova below To prevent the pea plant that was receiving pollen
from selffertilizing and confounding his results Mendel painstakingly removed all of the anthers from the plants
flowers before they had a chance to mature
Plants used in firstgeneration crosses were called P0 or parental generation one Figure 123 After each
cross Mendel collected the seeds belonging to the P0 plants and grew them the following season These
offspring were called the F1 or the first filial filial  offspring daughter or son generation Once Mendel
examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants he allowed them to selffertilize naturally He then
collected and grew the seeds from the F1 plants to produce the F2 or second filial generation Mendels
experiments extended beyond the F2 generation to the F3 and F4 generations and so on but it was the ratio
of characteristics in the P0F1F2 generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for Mendels
postulates
