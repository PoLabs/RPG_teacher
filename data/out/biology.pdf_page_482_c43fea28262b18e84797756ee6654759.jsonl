the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens occur by DNA transfer from the bacterium to the plant Although the
tumors do not kill the plants they stunt the plants and they become more susceptible to harsh environmental
conditions A tumefaciens affects many plants such as walnuts grapes nut trees and beets Artificially
introducing DNA into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells because of the thick plant cell wall
Researchers used the natural transfer of DNA from Agrobacterium to a plant host to introduce DNA fragments of
their choice into plant hosts In nature the diseasecausing A tumefaciens have a set of plasmids Ti plasmids
tumorinducing plasmids that contain genes to produce tumors in plants DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates
into the infected plant cells genome Researchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to remove the tumorcausing
genes and insert the desired DNA fragment for transfer into the plant genome The Ti plasmids carry antibiotic
resistance genes to aid selection and researchers can propagate them in E coli cells as well
The Organic Insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis
Bacillus thuringiensis Bt is a bacterium that produces protein crystals during sporulation that are toxic to many
insect species that affect plants Insects need to ingest Bt toxin in order to activate the toxin Insects that have
eaten Bt toxin stop feeding on the plants within a few hours After the toxin activates in the insects intestines
they die within a couple of days Modern biotechnology has allowed plants to encode their own crystal Bt
toxin that acts against insects Scientists have cloned the crystal toxin genes from Bt and introduced them into
plants Bt toxin is safe for the environment nontoxic to humans and other mammals and organic farmers have
approved it as a natural insecticide
Flavr Savr Tomato
The first GM crop on the market was the Flavr Savr Tomato in 1994 Scientists used antisense RNA technology
to slow the softening and rotting process caused by fungal infections which led to increased shelf life of the
GM tomatoes Additional genetic modification improved the tomatos flavor The Flavr Savr tomato did not
successfully stay in the market because of problems maintaining and shipping the crop
172  Mapping Genomes
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Define genomics

Describe genetic and physical maps

Describe genomic mapping methods
Genomics is the study of entire genomes including the complete set of genes their nucleotide sequence and
organization and their interactions within a species and with other species Genome mapping is the process
of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome The maps that genome mapping create are comparable
to the maps that we use to navigate streets A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location
on a chromosome Genetic maps provide the big picture similar to an interstate highway map and use genetic
markers similar to landmarks A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that cosegregates
shows genetic linkage with a specific trait Early geneticists called this linkage analysis Physical maps present
the intimate details of smaller chromosome regions similar to a detailed road map A physical map is a
representation of the physical distance in nucleotides between genes or genetic markers Both genetic linkage
maps and physical maps are required to build a genomes complete picture Having a complete genome map of
the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes Human genome maps help researchers
in their efforts to identify human diseasecausing genes related to illnesses like cancer heart disease and cystic
fibrosis We can use genome mapping in a variety of other applications such as using live microbes to clean
up pollutants or even prevent pollution Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to producing higher
crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to climate change
Genetic Maps
The study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency
between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment Scientists used the term
linkage before the discovery of DNA Early geneticists relied on observing phenotypic changes to understand
an organisms genotype Shortly after Gregor Mendel the father of modern genetics proposed that traits were
determined by what we now call genes other researchers observed that different traits were often inherited
