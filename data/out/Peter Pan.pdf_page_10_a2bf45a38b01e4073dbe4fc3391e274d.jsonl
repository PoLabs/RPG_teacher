though he knew about stocks and shares had no real mastery of his
tie Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest but there
were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he
had swallowed his pride and used a madeup tie
This was such an occasion He came rushing into the nursery with
the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand
Why what is the matter father dear
Matter he yelled he really yelled This tie it will not tie He
became dangerously sarcastic Not round my neck Round the bed
post Oh yes twenty times have I made it up round the bedpost but
round my neck no Oh dear no begs to be excused
He thought Mrs Darling was not sufficiently impressed and he
went on sternly I warn you of this mother that unless this tie is
round my neck we dont go out to dinner tonight and if I dont go
out to dinner tonight I never go to the office again and if I dont go
to the office again you and I starve and our children will be flung
into the streets
Even then Mrs Darling was placid Let me try dear she said
and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do and with her
nice cool hands she tied his tie for him while the children stood
around to see their fate decided Some men would have resented her
being able to do it so easily but Mr Darling had far too fine a nature
for that he thanked her carelessly at once forgot his rage and in
another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his
back
How wildly we romped says Mrs Darling now recalling it
Our last romp Mr Darling groaned
O George do you remember Michael suddenly said to me How
did you get to know me mother
I remember
They were rather sweet dont you think George
And they were ours ours and now they are gone
The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana and most
unluckily Mr Darling collided against her covering his trousers with
hairs They were not only new trousers but they were the first he had
ever had with braid on them and he had had to bite his lip to prevent
the tears coming Of course Mrs Darling brushed him but he began
to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse
George Nana is a treasure
No doubt but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks
upon the children as puppies
Oh no dear one I feel sure she knows they have souls
I wonder Mr Darling said thoughtfully I wonder It was an
opportunity his wife felt for telling him about the boy At first he
poohpoohed the story but he became thoughtful when she showed
him the shadow
It is nobody I know he said examining it carefully but it does
look a scoundrel
We were still discussing it you remember says Mr Darling
when Nana came in with Michaels medicine You will never carry
