Figure 175 Scientists use polymerase chain reaction or PCR to amplify a specific DNA sequence Primersshort
pieces of DNA complementary to each end of the target sequence combine with genomic DNA Taq polymerase and
deoxynucleotides Taq polymerase is a DNA polymerase isolated from the thermostable bacterium Thermus aquaticus
that is able to withstand the high temperatures that scientists use in PCR Thermus aquaticus grows in the Lower
Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park Reverse transcriptase PCR RTPCR is similar to PCR but cDNA is made
from an RNA template before PCR begins
DNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR
RTPCR The first step is to recreate the original DNA template strand called cDNA by applying DNA
nucleotides to the mRNA This process is called reverse transcription This requires the presence of an enzyme
called reverse transcriptase After the cDNA is made regular PCR can be used to amplify it

Hybridization Southern Blotting and Northern Blotting
Scientists can probe nucleic acid samples such as fragmented genomic DNA and RNA extracts for the
presence of certain sequences Scientists design and label short DNA fragments or probes with radioactive or
fluorescent dyes to aid detection Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their
