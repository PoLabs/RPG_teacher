Kingdom had the vote before 1832 While some countries such as France 
Switzerland and Denmark adopted universal manhood suffrage in the wake 
of the 1848 Revolutions this was in most cases a sudden leap forward France 
for example had a much smaller electorate than Britain until 1848 
There was therefore a considerable number of people formally excluded 
from the political process Campaigns for franchise reform aimed to win 
inclusion into the political nation This was an old radicalism drawing on 
ideas of political representation democracy and popular sovereigntyas 
opposed to the new radicalism of socialism which was primarily concerned 
with a critique of capitalism Many social movements were middle class in 
character vehicles for bourgeois frustration at the aristocratic hold over 
the levers of power throughout Europe although some of the most notable 
contributions were made by workingclass individuals and movements 
The argument for inclusion in the political nation as a voter and thus a 
full citizen was articulated by many social movements In Ireland during the 
1820s mass mobilisation and political protest were pioneered by the Catholic 
Association which campaigned for the removal of all political prohibitions 
on Catholics including the right to sit in parliament The withholding of 
this right Association members argued deprived a majority of the Irish 
population of a voice in the sovereign assembly of the United Kingdom After 
intense pressure and fearful of creating a revolutionary situation in Ireland 
the British government passed the Catholic Emancipation Act in 1829 
Other social movements focussed more intently on suffrage The working
class Chartist movement in the United Kingdom campaigned for universal 
male suffrage and other radical parliamentary reforms Its first historian RG 
Gammage a former member of the movement stressed the moral social and 
economic transformation that inclusion in the franchise promised In 1854 
he argued that the masses contrasted their financial hardship to the opulent 
conditions of the enfranchised classes reasoning that exclusion from 
political power is the cause of our social anomalies This was a powerful non
socialist radical critique only by allowing the working class to be able to choose 
their own political representatives could economic justice be established The 
logic was that the progressive transformation of society would follow the 
widening of the franchise
In other countries the spark for democratising the franchise came from 
more middleclass sources The driver of the 1848 Revolution in France was 
the pursuit of wider suffrage which united radical republicans and moderate 
Orlanists both of whom were firmly bourgeois It was a decidedly non
parliamentary activitythe reform banquets of 18471848that popularised 
and energised the reform campaign Much like the Chartists the French 
reformers envisioned universal suffrage as the path to political inclusion and 
greater social harmony
