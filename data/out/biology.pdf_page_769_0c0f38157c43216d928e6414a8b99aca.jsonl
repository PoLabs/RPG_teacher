style
related group of angiosperms that produce embryos with one cotyledon and pollen with a single ridge
describes a species in which the male and female reproductive organs are on the same plant
liquid rich in sugars produced by flowers to attract animal pollinators
chamber that contains and protects the ovule or female megasporangium
cone containing two ovules per scale
female gametophyte
part of the plant consisting of the calyx sepals and corolla petals
modified leaf interior to the sepals colorful petals attract animal pollinators
fused group of carpels
structure containing the male gametophyte of the plant
extension from the pollen grain that delivers sperm to the egg cell
transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma
transitional group of plants that resembled conifers because they produced wood yet still
reproduced like ferns
structure containing the embryo storage tissue and protective coat
modified leaf that encloses the bud outermost structure of a flower
seed plant from the Greek sperm seed and phyte plant
structure that contains the male reproductive organs
uppermost structure of the carpel where pollen is deposited
plant structure with a tight arrangement of sporophylls around a central stalk as seen in cones or
flowers the male strobilus produces pollen and the female strobilus produces eggs
long thin structure that links the stigma to the ovary
CHAPTER SUMMARY
261 Evolution of Seed Plants
Seed plants appeared about one million years ago during the Carboniferous period Two major innovations
were seeds and pollen Seeds protect the embryo from desiccation and provide it with a store of nutrients to
support the early growth of the sporophyte Seeds are also equipped to delay germination until growth
conditions are optimal Pollen allows seed plants to reproduce in the absence of water The gametophytes of
seed plants shrank while the sporophytes became prominent structures and the diploid stage became the
longest phase of the life cycle
In the gymnosperms which appeared during the drier Permian period and became the dominant group during
the Triassic pollen was dispersed by wind and their naked seeds developed in the sporophylls of a strobilus
Angiosperms bear both flowers and fruit Flowers expand the possibilities for pollination especially by insects
who have coevolved with the flowering plants Fruits offer additional protection to the embryo during its
development and also assist with seed dispersal Angiosperms appeared during the Mesozoic era and have
become the dominant plant life in terrestrial habitats
262 Gymnosperms
Gymnosperms are heterosporous seed plants that produce naked seeds They appeared in the Paleozoic
