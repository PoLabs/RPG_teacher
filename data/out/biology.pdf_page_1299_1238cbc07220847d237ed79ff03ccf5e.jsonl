a lysosome which digests the food Waste is excreted by exocytosis
Flame Cells of Planaria and Nephridia of Worms
As multicellular systems evolved to have organ systems that divided the metabolic needs of the body individual
organs evolved to perform the excretory function Planaria are flatworms that live in freshwater Their excretory
system consists of two tubules connected to a highly branched duct system The cells in the tubules are called
flame cells or protonephridia because they have a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when
viewed under the microscope as illustrated in Figure 4110a The cilia propel waste matter down the tubules and
out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface cilia also draw water from the interstitial
fluid allowing for filtration Any valuable metabolites are recovered by reabsorption Flame cells are found in
flatworms including parasitic tapeworms and freeliving planaria They also maintain the organisms osmotic
balance
Figure 4110 In the excretory system of the a planaria cilia of flame cells propel waste through a tubule formed
by a tube cell Tubules are connected into branched structures that lead to pores located all along the sides of the
body The filtrate is secreted through these pores In b annelids such as earthworms nephridia filter fluid from the
coelom or body cavity Beating cilia at the opening of the nephridium draw water from the coelom into a tubule As
the filtrate passes down the tubules nutrients and other solutes are reabsorbed by capillaries Filtered fluid containing
nitrogenous and other wastes is stored in a bladder and then secreted through a pore in the side of the body
Earthworms annelids have slightly more evolved excretory structures called nephridia illustrated in Figure
4110b A pair of nephridia is present on each segment of the earthworm They are similar to flame cells in that
they have a tubule with cilia Excretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore They are more evolved
than the flame cells in that they have a system for tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion
Malpighian Tubules of Insects
Malpighian tubules are found lining the gut of some species of arthropods such as the bee illustrated in Figure
4111 They are usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect Malpighian
tubules are convoluted which increases their surface area and they are lined with microvilli for reabsorption
and maintenance of osmotic balance Malpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall
of the rectum Body fluids are not filtered as in the case of nephridia urine is produced by tubular secretion
mechanisms by the cells lining the Malpighian tubules that are bathed in hemolymph a mixture of blood and
interstitial fluid that is found in insects and other arthropods as well as most mollusks Metabolic wastes like
