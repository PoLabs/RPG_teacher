chimpanzee Pan troglodytes and bonobo Pan paniscus lineages separated about 2 MYA Chimpanzees
and bonobos both live in Central Africa but the two species are separated by the Congo River a significant
geographic barrier Bonobos are slighter than chimpanzees but have longer legs and more hair on their heads
In chimpanzees white tail tufts identify juveniles while bonobos keep their white tail tufts for life Bonobos also
have higherpitched voices than chimpanzees Chimpanzees are more aggressive and sometimes kill animals
from other groups while bonobos are not known to do so Both chimpanzees and bonobos are omnivorous
Orangutan and gorilla diets also include foods from multiple sources although the predominant food items are
fruits for orangutans and foliage for gorillas

Human Evolution
The family Hominidae of order Primates includes the hominoids the great apes and humans Figure 2946
Evidence from the fossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee DNA suggests that humans
and chimpanzees diverged from a common hominoid ancestor approximately six million years ago Several
species evolved from the evolutionary branch that includes humans although our species is the only surviving
member The term hominin is used to refer to those species that evolved after this split of the primate line
thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees A number of marker
features differentiate humans from the other hominoids including bipedalism or upright posture increase in
the size of the brain and a fully opposable thumb that can touch the little finger Bipedal hominins include
several groups that were probably part of the modern human lineageAustralopithecus Homo habilis and
Homo erectusand several nonancestral groups that can be considered cousins of modern humans such as
Neanderthals and Denisovans
Determining the true lines of descent in hominins is difficult In years past when relatively few hominin fossils
had been recovered some scientists believed that considering them in order from oldest to youngest would
demonstrate the course of evolution from early hominins to modern humans In the past several years however
many new fossils have been found and it is clear that there was often more than one species alive at any one
time and that many of the fossils found and species named represent hominin species that died out and are
not ancestral to modern humans
