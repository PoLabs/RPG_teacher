amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided
When Harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of
things out of the crackers including a pack of nonexplodable luminous
balloons a GrowYourOwnWarts kit and his own new wizard chess set
The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were
going to end up as Mrs Norriss Christmas dinner
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball
fight on the grounds Then cold wet and gasping for breath they
returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room where Harry broke in
his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron He suspected he
wouldnt have lost so badly if Percy hadnt tried to help him so much
After a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and Christmas cake
everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and
watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because
theyd stolen his prefect badge
It had been Harrys best Christmas day ever Yet something had been
nagging at the back of his mind all day Not until he climbed into bed
was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had
sent it
Ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him
fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his
fourposter Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the
cloak out from under it
His fathers this had been his fathers He let the material flow
over his hands smoother than silk light as air Use it well the note
had said
He had to try it now He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak
around himself Looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and
shadows It was a very funny feeling
Use it well
Suddenly Harry felt wideawake The whole of Hogwarts was open to him
in this cloak Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the
dark and silence He could go anywhere in this anywhere and Filch
would never know
