Figure 4411 The mature cones of the jack pine Pinus banksiana open only when exposed to high temperatures
such as during a forest fire A fire is likely to kill most vegetation so a seedling that germinates after a fire is more likely
to receive ample sunlight than one that germinates under normal conditions credit USDA
Abiotic Factors Influencing Plant Growth
Temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production primary productivity and the amount
of organic matter available as food net primary productivity Net primary productivity is an estimation of
all of the organic matter available as food it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus
the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration In terrestrial environments net primary productivity is
estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area which is the total mass of living plants
excluding roots whose mass is very difficult to measure This means that a large percentage of plant biomass
which exists underground is not included in this measurement Net primary productivity is an important variable
when considering differences in biomes Very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground biomass
Annual biomass production is directly related to the abiotic components of the environment Environments with
the greatest amount of biomass produce conditions in which photosynthesis plant growth and the resulting net
primary productivity are optimized The climate of these areas is warm and wet Photosynthesis can proceed
at a high rate enzymes can work most efficiently and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive
transpiration together these factors lead to the maximal amount of carbon dioxide CO2 moving into the plant
resulting in high biomass production The aboveground biomass produces several important resources for
other living things including habitat and food Conversely dry and cold environments have lower photosynthetic
rates and therefore less biomass The animal communities living there will also be affected by the decrease in
available food
443  Terrestrial Biomes
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify the two major abiotic factors that determine terrestrial biomes

Recognize distinguishing characteristics of each of the eight major terrestrial biomes
The Earths biomes are categorized into two major groups terrestrial and aquatic Terrestrial biomes are based
on land while aquatic biomes include both ocean and freshwater biomes The eight major terrestrial biomes
on Earth are each distinguished by characteristic temperatures and amount of precipitation Comparing the
annual totals of precipitation and fluctuations in precipitation from one biome to another provides clues as to the
importance of abiotic factors in the distribution of biomes Temperature variation on a daily and seasonal basis is
also important for predicting the geographic distribution of the biome and the vegetation type in the biome The
distribution of these biomes shows that the same biome can occur in geographically distinct areas with similar
climates Figure 4412
