provincial borders There is an open debate on whether the very categories of 
centre and periphery obscure more than they illuminate
Either way each case had its own concerns and peculiarities For historians 
of France territorial privilege and autonomy along with representation and 
the social organisation of society are crucial to understanding the dynamics of 
centreperiphery relations Historians of Russia tend to trace these changing 
relations differently given the vastness of Russian territory and continuing 
territorial expansion the focus is more on the challenges of communication 
and administration shifting frontiers and evergrowing cultural diversity At 
the same time the two cases reveal a degree of contested centralisation that is 
less evident in cases such as early modern Germany where the central power 
was often in no position to impose its will

provincial Estatesassemblies representing the tripartite structure of early 
modern societythat carefully recorded these kinds of promises The Estates 
of Normandy Dauphin Brittany Barn and Artois all had such precious 
charters defining their relations with the King Provence was proud of its 
constitution made up of fiftythree requests drawn up by the Estates of Aix in 
1482 and presented to King Louis XI at the time of its unification with France 
Similarly Francis I 15151547 pronounced a declaration that recognised the 
privileges of Languedoc in fourteen articles 
The value of such provincial constitutions partly depended on how the 
lands had been united with the Crown Some seventeenth and eighteenth
century jurists distinguished between two types of union The main type lunion
