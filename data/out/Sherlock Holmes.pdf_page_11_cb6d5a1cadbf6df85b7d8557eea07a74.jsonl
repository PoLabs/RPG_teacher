A Scandal in Bohemia
Why indeed murmured Holmes
Your
Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I
was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von
Ormstein Grand Duke of CasselFelstein and heredi
tary King of Bohemia
But you can understand said our strange visitor
sitting down once more and passing his hand over his
high white forehead you can understand that I am
not accustomed to doing such business in my own
person Yet the matter was so delicate that I could
not conde it to an agent without putting myself in
his power I have come incognito from Prague for the
purpose of consulting you
Then pray consult said Holmes shutting his
eyes once more
The facts are briey these Some ve years ago
during a lengthy visit to Warsaw I made the acquain
tance of the wellknown adventuress Irene Adler The
name is no doubt familiar to you
Kindly look her up in my index Doctor mur
mured Holmes without opening his eyes For many
years he had adopted a system of docketing all para
graphs concerning men and things so that it was
difcult to name a subject or a person on which he
could not at once furnish information In this case I
found her biography sandwiched in between that of
a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staffcommander who
had written a monograph upon the deepsea shes
Let me see said Holmes
Hum
Born in
New Jersey in the year 1858 Contraltohum La
Scala hum Prima donna Imperial Opera of War
sawyes Retired from operatic stageha Living
in Londonquite so Your Majesty as I understand
became entangled with this young person wrote her
some compromising letters and is now desirous of
getting those letters back
Precisely so But how
Was there a secret marriage
None
No legal papers or certicates
None
Then I fail to follow your Majesty If this young
person should produce her letters for blackmailing or
other purposes how is she to prove their authentic
ity
There is the writing
Pooh pooh Forgery
My private notepaper
Stolen
My own seal
Imitated
My photograph
Bought
We were both in the photograph
Oh dear That is very bad Your Majesty has
indeed committed an indiscretion
I was madinsane
You have compromised yourself seriously
I was only Crown Prince then I was young I am
but thirty now
It must be recovered
We have tried and failed
Your Majesty must pay It must be bought
She will not sell
Stolen then
Five attempts have been made Twice burglars
in my pay ransacked her house Once we diverted
her luggage when she travelled Twice she has been
waylaid There has been no result
No sign of it
Absolutely none
Holmes laughed It is quite a pretty little prob
lem said he
But a very serious one to me returned the King
reproachfully
Very indeed And what does she propose to do
with the photograph
To ruin me
But how
I am about to be married
So I have heard
To Clotilde Lothman von SaxeMeningen second
daughter of the King of Scandinavia You may know
the strict principles of her family She is herself the
very soul of delicacy A shadow of a doubt as to my
conduct would bring the matter to an end
And Irene Adler
Threatens to send them the photograph And she
will do it I know that she will do it You do not know
her but she has a soul of steel She has the face of the
most beautiful of women and the mind of the most
resolute of men Rather than I should marry another
woman there are no lengths to which she would not
gonone
You are sure that she has not sent it yet
I am sure
