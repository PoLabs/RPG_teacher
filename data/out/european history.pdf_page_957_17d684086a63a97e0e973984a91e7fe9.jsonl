points of memory and heritageregional and local memories and heritage 
were zealously cultivated by local patriots throughout the nineteenth century

across Europe in regional culture and heritage But even this regionalist 
movement was nevertheless intrinsically bound up with nationalisation and 
urbanisation although it positioned itself as its alternative or adversary
