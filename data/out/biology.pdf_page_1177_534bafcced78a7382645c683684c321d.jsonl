The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone PTH PTH increases blood calcium concentrations when
calcium ion levels fall below normal PTH 1 enhances reabsorption of Ca2 by the kidneys 2 stimulates
osteoclast activity and inhibits osteoblast activity and 3 it stimulates synthesis and secretion of calcitriol by
the kidneys which enhances Ca2 absorption by the digestive system PTH is produced by chief cells of the
parathyroid PTH and calcitonin work in opposition to one another to maintain homeostatic Ca2 levels in body
fluids Another type of cells oxyphil cells exist in the parathyroid but their function is not known These hormones
encourage bone growth muscle mass and blood cell formation in children and women
Adrenal Glands
The adrenal glands are associated with the kidneys one gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated
in Figure 3718 The adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla These
regions secrete different hormones

Adrenal Cortex
The adrenal cortex is made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks These layers form
three distinct regions an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids a middle zona fasciculata
that produces glucocorticoids and an inner zona reticularis that produces androgens
The main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone which regulates the concentration of Na ions in urine sweat
