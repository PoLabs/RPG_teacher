Figure 620 Vitamins are important coenzymes or precursors of coenzymes and are required for enzymes to function
properly Multivitamin capsules usually contain mixtures of all the vitamins at different percentages
Enzyme Compartmentalization
In eukaryotic cells molecules such as enzymes are usually compartmentalized into different organelles This
allows for yet another level of regulation of enzyme activity Enzymes required only for certain cellular processes
are sometimes housed separately along with their substrates allowing for more efficient chemical reactions
Examples of this sort of enzyme regulation based on location and proximity include the enzymes involved in the
latter stages of cellular respiration which take place exclusively in the mitochondria and the enzymes involved
in digesting cellular debris and foreign materials located within lysosomes
Feedback Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways
Molecules can regulate enzyme function in many ways However a major question remains What are these
molecules and from where do they come Some are cofactors and coenzymes ions and organic molecules as
you have learned What other molecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation such as allosteric modulation
and competitive and noncompetitive inhibition The answer is that a wide variety of molecules can perform these
roles Some include pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical drugs toxins and poisons from the environment
Perhaps the most relevant sources of enzyme regulatory molecules with respect to cellular metabolism are
cellular metabolic reaction products themselves In a most efficient and elegant way cells have evolved to use
their own reactions products for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity Feedback inhibition involves using a
reaction product to regulate its own further production Figure 621 The cell responds to the abundance of
specific products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic reactions Such reaction products may
inhibit the enzymes that catalyzed their production through the mechanisms that we described above
