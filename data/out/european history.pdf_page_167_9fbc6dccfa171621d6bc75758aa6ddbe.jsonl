21 DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE
147
These numbers are even more impressive if we consider that people living at the 
end of the nineteenth century were physically better off than their predecessors 
a hundred years before Europe had broken free of the Malthusian trap 
Not only did populations grow but human life courses also started to change 
Some demographers use the term demographic transition to designate this 
change The key to this mechanism would be the transition from a population 
regime with high fertility and high mortality to a population regime with low 
fertility and low mortality 
In its most stringent form the demographic transition model divides the 
mechanism into four phases 
	
The first phase is a steady state where birth and mortality rates are 
high This phase has been described in the chapter on demographic 
change in the early modern period 
	
In the second phase the mortality rate diminishes while the birth 
rate remains high resulting in a growing gap between mortality and 
fertility rates
	
During the third phase the gap between mortality and birth rates 
decreasesafter an initial lag the birth rate starts diminishing too 
	
The fourth phase is when both rates get relatively close to each other 
again and enter a new steady state of low birth and mortality rates 
This is not necessarily the end of demographic change as will be 
discussed in the chapter on demographic change in the twentieth 
century
The demographic transition model was expected to provide a comprehensive 
explanation of the changes that took place in Europe in the nineteenth century 
and also occurred elsewhere in the twentieth century However in the last 
few decades the determinism of the theory has been heavily criticised by 
social historians historical anthropologists and demographers alike because 
the timing duration order and underlying reasons for the different phases 
of the demographic transition differed between countries Moreover the 
model is very descriptive and does not explain when or why people decided 
to have fewer children It might very well be possible that there was not a 
single demographic transition that spread through Europe but a myriad 
of demographic transitions with slightly different causes Therefore the 
demographic transition model can at best be seen as a descriptive mechanism 
merely stating that at aggregate levels there is an association between decreases 
in mortality and fertility
