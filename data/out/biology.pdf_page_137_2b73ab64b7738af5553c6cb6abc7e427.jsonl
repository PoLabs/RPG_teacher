Figure 422 Microfilaments thicken the cortex around the cells inner edge Like rubber bands they resist tension
There are microtubules in the cells interior where they maintain their shape by resisting compressive forces There are
intermediate filaments throughout the cell that hold organelles in place
Microfilaments
Of the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton microfilaments are the narrowest They function in
cellular movement have a diameter of about 7 nm and are comprised of two globular protein intertwined
strands which we call actin Figure 423 For this reason we also call microfilaments actin filaments
