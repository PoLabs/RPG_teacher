He tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without
Quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he
tripped and fell over Quirrell ignored him He was still talking to
himself What does this mirror do How does it work Help me Master
And to Harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come
from Quirrell himself
Use the boy Use the boy
Quirrell rounded on Harry
Yes  Potter  come here
He clapped his hands once and the ropes binding Harry fell off Harry
got slowly to his feet
Come here Quirrell repeated Look in the mirror and tell me what you
see
Harry walked toward him
I must lie he thought desperately I must look and lie about what I
see thats all
Quirrell moved close behind him Harry breathed in the funny smell that
seemed to come from Quirrells turban He closed his eyes stepped in
front of the mirror and opened them again
He saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first But a moment
later the reflection smiled at him It put its hand into its pocket and
pulled out a bloodred stone It winked and put the Stone back in its
pocket  and as it did so Harry felt something heavy drop into his
real pocket Somehow  incredibly  hed gotten the Stone
Well said Quirrell impatiently What do you see
Harry screwed up his courage
I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore he invented I  Ive
won the house cup for Gryffindor
