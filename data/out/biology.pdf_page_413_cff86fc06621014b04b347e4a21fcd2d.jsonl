CHAPTER SUMMARY
141 Historical Basis of Modern Understanding
DNA was first isolated from white blood cells by Friedrich Miescher who called it nuclein because it was
isolated from nuclei Frederick Griffiths experiments with strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae provided the
first hint that DNA may be the transforming principle Avery MacLeod and McCarty showed that DNA is
required for the transformation of bacteria Later experiments by Hershey and Chase using bacteriophage T2
proved that DNA is the genetic material Chargaff found that the ratio of A  T and C  G and that the
percentage content of A T G and C is different for different species
142 DNA Structure and Sequencing
The currently accepted model of the doublehelix structure of DNA was proposed by Watson and Crick Some
of the salient features are that the two strands that make up the double helix have complementary base
sequences and antiparallel orientations Alternating deoxyribose sugars and phosphates form the backbone of
the structure and the nitrogenous bases are stacked like rungs inside The diameter of the double helix 2 nm
is uniform throughout A purine always pairs with a pyrimidine A pairs with T and G pairs with C One turn of
the helix has 10 base pairs Prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features Most
prokaryotes contain a single circular chromosome In general eukaryotic chromosomes contain a linear DNA
molecule packaged into nucleosomes and have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining
reflecting different states of packaging and compaction
143 Basics of DNA Replication
During cell division each daughter cell receives a copy of each molecule of DNA by a process known as DNA
replication The single chromosome of a prokaryote or each chromosome of a eukaryote consists of a single
continuous double helix The model for DNA replication suggests that the two strands of the double helix
separate during replication and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is
copied In the conservative model of replication the parental DNA is conserved and the daughter DNA is
newly synthesized The semiconservative model suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands acts as
template for new DNA to be synthesized after replication each doublestranded DNA retains the parental or
old strand and one new strand The dispersive model suggested that the two copies of the DNA would have
segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA The Meselson and Stahl experiment supported the
semiconservative model of replication in which an entire replicated chromosome consists of one parental
strand and one newly synthesized strand of DNA
144 DNA Replication in Prokaryotes
Replication in prokaryotes starts from a sequence found on the chromosome called the origin of
replicationthe point at which the DNA opens up Helicase opens up the DNA double helix resulting in the
formation of the replication fork Singlestrand binding proteins bind to the singlestranded DNA near the
replication fork to keep the fork open Primase synthesizes an RNA primer to initiate synthesis by DNA
polymerase which can add nucleotides only to the 3 end of a previously synthesized primer strand Both new
DNA strands grow according to their respective 53 directions One strand is synthesized continuously in the
direction of the replication fork this is called the leading strand The other strand is synthesized in a direction
away from the replication fork in short stretches of DNA known as Okazaki fragments This strand is known as
the lagging strand Once replication is completed the RNA primers are replaced by DNA nucleotides and the
DNA is sealed with DNA ligase which creates phosphodiester bonds between the 3OH of one end and the 5
phosphate of the other strand
145 DNA Replication in Eukaryotes
Replication in eukaryotes starts at multiple origins of replication The mechanism is quite similar to that in
prokaryotes A primer is required to initiate synthesis which is then extended by DNA polymerase as it adds
nucleotides one by one to the growing chain The leading strand is synthesized continuously whereas the
lagging strand is synthesized in short stretches called Okazaki fragments The RNA primers are replaced with
DNA nucleotides the DNA Okazaki fragments are linked into one continuous strand by DNA ligase The ends
of the chromosomes pose a problem as the primer RNA at the 5 ends of the DNA cannot be replaced with
DNA and the chromosome is progressively shortened Telomerase an enzyme with an inbuilt RNA template
