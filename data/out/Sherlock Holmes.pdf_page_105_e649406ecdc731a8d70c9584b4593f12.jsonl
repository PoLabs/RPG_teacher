The Adventure of the Speckled Band
down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon
the pillow
It goes to the housekeepers room
It looks newer than the other things
Yes it was only put there a couple of years ago
Your sister asked for it I suppose
No I never heard of her using it We used always
to get what we wanted for ourselves
Indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a
bellpull there You will excuse me for a few minutes
while I satisfy myself as to this oor He threw him
self down upon his face with his lens in his hand and
crawled swiftly backward and forward examining
minutely the cracks between the boards Then he did
the same with the woodwork with which the cham
ber was panelled Finally he walked over to the bed
and spent some time in staring at it and in running
his eye up and down the wall Finally he took the
bellrope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug
Why its a dummy said he
Wont it ring
No it is not even attached to a wire This is very
interesting You can see now that it is fastened to
a hook just above where the little opening for the
ventilator is
How very absurd I never noticed that before
Very strange muttered Holmes pulling at the
rope There are one or two very singular points
about this room For example what a fool a builder
must be to open a ventilator into another room when
with the same trouble he might have communicated
with the outside air
That is also quite modern said the lady
Done about the same time as the bellrope re
marked Holmes
Yes there were several little changes carried out
about that time
They seem to have been of a most interesting
characterdummy bellropes and ventilators which
do not ventilate With your permission Miss Stoner
we shall now carry our researches into the inner apart
ment
Dr Grimesby Roylotts chamber was larger than
that of his stepdaughter but was as plainly fur
nished A campbed a small wooden shelf full of
books mostly of a technical character an armchair
beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall
a round table and a large iron safe were the principal
things which met the eye Holmes walked slowly
round and examined each and all of them with the
keenest interest
Whats in here he asked tapping the safe
My stepfathers business papers
Oh you have seen inside then
Only once some years ago I remember that it
was full of papers
There isnt a cat in it for example
No What a strange idea
Well look at this He took up a small saucer of
milk which stood on the top of it
No we dont keep a cat But there is a cheetah
and a baboon
Ah yes of course Well a cheetah is just a big cat
and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satis
fying its wants I daresay There is one point which
I should wish to determine He squatted down in
front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it
with the greatest attention
Thank you That is quite settled said he rising
and putting his lens in his pocket Hullo Here is
something interesting
The object which had caught his eye was a small
dog lash hung on one corner of the bed The lash
however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make
a loop of whipcord
What do you make of that Watson
Its a common enough lash But I dont know
why it should be tied
That is not quite so common is it Ah me its a
wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains
to crime it is the worst of all I think that I have seen
enough now Miss Stoner and with your permission
we shall walk out upon the lawn
I had never seen my friends face so grim or his
brow so dark as it was when we turned from the
scene of this investigation We had walked several
times up and down the lawn neither Miss Stoner nor
myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he
roused himself from his reverie
It is very essential Miss Stoner said he that
you should absolutely follow my advice in every re
spect
I shall most certainly do so
The matter is too serious for any hesitation Your
life may depend upon your compliance
I assure you that I am in your hands
In the rst place both my friend and I must
spend the night in your room
