The Adventure of the Engineers Thumb
O
f all the problems which have been submit
ted to my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes for
solution during the years of our intimacy
there were only two which I was the means
of introducing to his noticethat of Mr Hatherleys
thumb and that of Colonel Warburtons madness Of
these the latter may have afforded a ner eld for
an acute and original observer but the other was so
strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details
that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon
record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for
those deductive methods of reasoning by which he
achieved such remarkable results The story has I
believe been told more than once in the newspapers
but like all such narratives its effect is much less
striking when set forth en bloc in a single halfcolumn
of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your
own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as
each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on
to the complete truth At the time the circumstances
made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of
two years has hardly served to weaken the effect
It was in the summer of 89 not long after my mar
riage that the events occurred which I am now about
to summarise I had returned to civil practice and had
nally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms
although I continually visited him and occasionally
even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so
far as to come and visit us My practice had steadily
increased and as I happened to live at no very great
distance from Paddington Station I got a few patients
from among the ofcials One of these whom I had
cured of a painful and lingering disease was never
weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring
to send me on every sufferer over whom he might
have any inuence
One morning at a little before seven oclock I
was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to
announce that two men had come from Paddington
and were waiting in the consultingroom I dressed
hurriedly for I knew by experience that railway cases
were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs As I
descended my old ally the guard came out of the
room and closed the door tightly behind him
Ive got him here he whispered jerking his
thumb over his shoulder hes all right
What is it then I asked for his manner sug
gested that it was some strange creature which he
had caged up in my room
Its a new patient he whispered I thought Id
bring him round myself then he couldnt slip away
There he is all safe and sound I must go now Doctor
I have my dooties just the same as you And off he
went this trusty tout without even giving me time to
thank him
I entered my consultingroom and found a gentle
man seated by the table He was quietly dressed in
a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which
he had laid down upon my books Round one of his
hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was
mottled all over with bloodstains He was young not
more than veandtwenty I should say with a strong
masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave
me the impression of a man who was suffering from
some strong agitation which it took all his strength
of mind to control
I am sorry to knock you up so early Doctor said
he but I have had a very serious accident during
the night I came in by train this morning and on
inquiring at Paddington as to where I might nd a
doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here
I gave the maid a card but I see that she has left it
upon the sidetable
I took it up and glanced at it Mr Victor Hather
ley hydraulic engineer 16A Victoria Street 3rd
oor That was the name style and abode of my
morning visitor I regret that I have kept you wait
ing said I sitting down in my librarychair You
are fresh from a night journey I understand which is
in itself a monotonous occupation
Oh my night could not be called monotonous
said he and laughed He laughed very heartily with
a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and
shaking his sides All my medical instincts rose up
against that laugh
Stop it I cried pull yourself together and I
poured out some water from a caraffe
It was useless however He was off in one of those
hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature
when some great crisis is over and gone Presently
he came to himself once more very weary and pale
looking
I have been making a fool of myself he gasped
Not at all Drink this I dashed some brandy
into the water and the colour began to come back to
his bloodless cheeks
Thats better said he And now Doctor per
haps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather
to the place where my thumb used to be
He unwound the handkerchief and held out his
hand It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to
look at it There were four protruding ngers and a
horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should
