The first largescale businesses such as the manufactories were established 
to satisfy the needs of modern states which were undertaking to develop their 
armies in the sixteenth century The state was especially interested in arms 
production the textile industry and metallurgy Manufactories were heavily 
subsidised by the state
Manufactories also acted as indispensable levers of technological transfer 
Apprentices of small workshops operating with two or three employees within 
the guild system tended to acquire work and life experiences in the course of 
their wandering about Europe With the manufactories finally there seems to 
have developed an intrinsic relationship between migration and innovation 
Italian craftsmen producing highly esteemed stained glasses or silk fabrics 
fled from the Spanish Inquisition and settled in the Holy Roman Empire in 
the sixteenth century Huguenot weavers and makers of Gobelin tapestries 
fled from France in the late seventeenth century and settled in England and 
the United Provinces of the Netherlands and they exerted lasting influence 
on the development of Prussias network of manufactories Nevertheless 
the proportion of largescale businesses remained relatively low in the early 
modern age even at the end of the eighteenth century in continental Europe 
there existed very few manufactories employing as many as several hundred 
people Barcelona stood out in this respect as there were approximately 100 
large manufacturing plants in the city
The rise of the modern industrial age could not do without the division 
of labour largescale specialisation technological innovation and continuous 
capital investment This first manifested in England from the 1730s onwards 
with the advent of the industrial revolution The term revolution may be 
somewhat misleading however as the development was far from radical and 
swift
Regarding the direct application of set procedures the skills and knowledge 
involved in the eighteenthcentury beginnings of modern industry were rather 
precarious though certain practices based on observation and experimentation 
had already been methodically applied from the late seventeenth century 
onwards The most striking feature of eighteenthcentury technical innovations 
in England had not been worked out by scientists but rather by experimenting 
tinkers selftaught mechanics engineers and entrepreneurs The early 
decades of the eighteenth century saw two foundational innovations which 
had lasting effects First there was the introduction of coke heating in the 
process of melting iron getting rid of the dependency on charcoal invented in 
Coalbrookdale in 1709 by Abraham Darby 16781717 an ironmonger The 
second invention which supplemented and gradually replaced the wind and 
water wheels as a source of energy was the development of the steam engine 
invented in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen 16641729 tinker and ironmonger 
in Staffordshire and developed in 1769 by James Watt mathematician and
