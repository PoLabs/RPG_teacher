Negative Regulation of the Cell Cycle
The second group of cellcycle regulatory molecules are negative regulators which stop the cell cycle
Remember that in positive regulation active molecules cause the cycle to progress
The best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein Rb p53 and p21
Retinoblastoma proteins are a group of tumorsuppressor proteins common in many cells We should note here
that the 53 and 21 designations refer to the functional molecular masses of the proteins p in kilodaltons a
dalton is equal to an atomic mass unit which is equal to one proton or one neutron or 1 gmol Much of what
is known about cellcycle regulation comes from research conducted with cells that have lost regulatory control
All three of these regulatory proteins were discovered to be damaged or nonfunctional in cells that had begun
to replicate uncontrollably ie became cancerous In each case the main cause of the unchecked progress
through the cell cycle was a faulty copy of the regulatory protein
Rb p53 and p21 act primarily at the G1 checkpoint p53 is a multifunctional protein that has a major impact on
the commitment of a cell to division because it acts when there is damaged DNA in cells that are undergoing the
preparatory processes during G1 If damaged DNA is detected p53 halts the cell cycle and then recruits specific
enzymes to repair the DNA If the DNA cannot be repaired p53 can trigger apoptosis or cell suicide to prevent
the duplication of damaged chromosomes As p53 levels rise the production of p21 is triggered p21 enforces
the halt in the cycle dictated by p53 by binding to and inhibiting the activity of the Cdkcyclin complexes As a cell
is exposed to more stress higher levels of p53 and p21 accumulate making it less likely that the cell will move
into the S phase
Rb which largely monitors cell size exerts its regulatory influence on other positive regulator proteins In the
active dephosphorylated state Rb binds to proteins called transcription factors most commonly E2F Figure
1013 Transcription factors turn on specific genes allowing the production of proteins encoded by that gene
When Rb is bound to E2F production of proteins necessary for the G1S transition is blocked As the cell
increases in size Rb is slowly phosphorylated until it becomes inactivated Rb releases E2F which can now turn
on the gene that produces the transition protein and this particular block is removed For the cell to move past
each of the checkpoints all positive regulators must be turned on and all negative regulators must be turned
off
Figure 1013 Rb halts the cell cycle and releases its hold in response to cell growth
Rb and other proteins that negatively regulate the cell cycle are sometimes called tumor suppressors Why
do you think the name tumor suppressor might be appropriate for these proteins
