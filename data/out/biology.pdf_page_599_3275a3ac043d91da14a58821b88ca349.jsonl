Introduction
In the recent past scientists grouped living things into five kingdomsanimals plants fungi protists and
prokaryotesbased on several criteria such as the absence or presence of a nucleus and other membrane
bound organelles the absence or presence of cell walls multicellularity and so on In the late 20th century the
pioneering work of Carl Woese and others compared sequences of smallsubunit ribosomal RNA SSU rRNA
which resulted in a more fundamental way to group organisms on Earth Based on differences in the structure
of cell membranes and in rRNA Woese and his colleagues proposed that all life on Earth evolved along three
lineages called domains The domain Bacteria comprises all organisms in the kingdom Bacteria the domain
Archaea comprises the rest of the prokaryotes and the domain Eukarya comprises all eukaryotesincluding
organisms in the kingdoms Animalia Plantae Fungi and Protista
Two of the three domainsBacteria and Archaeaare prokaryotic Prokaryotes were the first inhabitants on
