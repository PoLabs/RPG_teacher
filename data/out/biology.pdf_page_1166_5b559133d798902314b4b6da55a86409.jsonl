When blood glucose levels decline below normal levels for example between meals or when glucose is utilized
rapidly during exercise the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas Glucagon raises
blood glucose levels eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to
glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis Glucose can then be utilized
as energy by muscle cells and released into circulation by the liver cells Glucagon also stimulates absorption of
amino acids from the blood by the liver which then converts them to glucose This process of glucose synthesis
is called gluconeogenesis Glucagon also stimulates adipose cells to release fatty acids into the blood These
actions mediated by glucagon result in an increase in blood glucose levels to normal homeostatic levels Rising
blood glucose levels inhibit further glucagon release by the pancreas via a negative feedback mechanism In
this way insulin and glucagon work together to maintain homeostatic glucose levels as shown in Figure 3711
