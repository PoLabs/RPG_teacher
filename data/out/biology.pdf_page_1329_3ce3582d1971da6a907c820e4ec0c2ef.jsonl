Vaccinologist
Vaccination or immunization involves the delivery usually by injection as shown in Figure 4218 of
noninfectious antigens derived from known pathogens Other components called adjuvants are delivered
in parallel to help stimulate the immune response Immunological memory is the reason vaccines work
Ideally the effect of vaccination is to elicit immunological memory and thus resistance to specific pathogens
without the individual having to experience an infection

Vaccinologists are involved in the process of vaccine development from the initial idea to the availability
of the completed vaccine This process can take decades can cost millions of dollars and can involve
many obstacles along the way For instance injected vaccines stimulate the systemic immune system
eliciting humoral and cellmediated immunity but have little effect on the mucosal response which presents
a challenge because many pathogens are deposited and replicate in mucosal compartments and the
injection does not provide the most efficient immune memory for these disease agents For this reason
vaccinologists are actively involved in developing new vaccines that are applied via intranasal aerosol
oral or transcutaneous absorbed through the skin delivery methods Importantly mucosaladministered
vaccines elicit both mucosal and systemic immunity and produce the same level of disease resistance as
injected vaccines
