owls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an everythin
Twenty minutes later they left Eeylops Owl Emporium which had been
dark and full of rustling and flickering jewelbright eyes Harry now
carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with
her head under her wing He couldnt stop stammering his thanks
sounding just like Professor Quirrell
Don mention it said Hagrid gruffly Don expect youve had a lotta
presents from them Dursleys Just Ollivanders left now  only place fer
wands Ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wand
A magic wand this was what Harry had been really looking forward to
The last shop was narrow and shabby Peeling gold letters over the door
read Ollivanders Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC A single wand lay
on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped
inside It was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair
that Hagrid sat on to wait Harry felt strangely as though he had
entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that
had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow
boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling For some reason the back of
his neck prickled The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle
with some secret magic
Good afternoon said a soft voice Harry jumped Hagrid must have
jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly
off the spindly chair
An old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like
moons through the gloom of the shop
Hello said Harry awkwardly
Ah yes said the man Yes yes I thought Id be seeing you soon
Harry Potter It wasnt a question You have your mothers eyes It
seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand Ten
and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow Nice wand for charm
work
Mr Ollivander moved closer to Harry Harry wished he would blink Those
