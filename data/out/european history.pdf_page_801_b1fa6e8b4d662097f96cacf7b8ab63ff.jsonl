The literary scholar Edward Said developed the notion of Orientalism as 
an ideological mechanism for the selfdefinition of Europeans through the 
differentiation of the Other inferior and the Self superior This is closely 
connected to the westeast framework of centreperipheries However within 
the European continent itself the centreperiphery relationship is also present 
It can be observed in both eastwest and northsouth relations on the one hand 
Eastern Europe including the postcommunist countries that were behind the 
Iron Curtain in contrast with the centre of Europe Benelux France Germany 
or the United Kingdom on the other hand the more symbolic construction 
of northsouth in which Scandinavian countries are seen as modern and 
developed in comparison with the southern countries of the Mediterranean 
peninsulas Nonetheless some scholars reject these dichotomies usually in 
relation to particular countries In relation to Russia they argue instead in 
favour of an awkward triptych in which Russia was neither fully western 
nor eastern but was rather inserted between West and East Therefore it is 
important to note that in this imaginary geography of Europe built from 
centreperiphery dualities some countries receive an exotic representation 
such as Russia or even Spain through Flamenco Muslim architecture the idea 
of religious obscurantism or the dictatorship of Francisco Franco Therefore 
these symbolic constructions reinforce the orientalisation of some countries or 
regions within the European continent itself
European Empires From Pax Britannica to the European 
Union
There is a wellknown map from 1904 by the British geographer Halford 
Mackinder 18611947 on which the developed world is a periphery in 
relation to the pivot area What Mackinder designates as the pivot is a large 
nearly uninhabited part of the world History happened in the periphery 
but as Mackinder suggests the real question was that of who ruled the pivot 
area Britain at the time of this maps drawing was at the zenith of its imperial 
power and this was a very British view of power relations at that time 
Since Britain was the dominant player in European power relations we can 
characterise the beginning of the twentieth century as a Pax Britannica the 
core element of which was to maintain balance among the powers of mainland 
Europe The great challenger of the Pax Britannica was the rising power of 
Germany This new power was basically confined to Central Europe and 
had longlasting rivalries with the old powersincluding France and Britain 
with their hinterlands on other continents This contest led to two World
