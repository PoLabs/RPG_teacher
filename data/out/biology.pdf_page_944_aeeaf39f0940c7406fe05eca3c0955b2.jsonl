The products from the source are usually translocated to the nearest sink through the phloem For example
the highest leaves will send photosynthates upward to the growing shoot tip whereas lower leaves will direct
photosynthates downward to the roots Intermediate leaves will send products in both directions unlike the
flow in the xylem which is always unidirectional soil to leaf to atmosphere The pattern of photosynthate flow
changes as the plant grows and develops Photosynthates are directed primarily to the roots early on to shoots
and leaves during vegetative growth and to seeds and fruits during reproductive development They are also
directed to tubers for storage
Translocation Transport from Source to Sink
Photosynthates such as sucrose are produced in the mesophyll cells of photosynthesizing leaves From there
they are translocated through the phloem to where they are used or stored Mesophyll cells are connected by
cytoplasmic channels called plasmodesmata Photosynthates move through these channels to reach phloem
sievetube elements STEs in the vascular bundles From the mesophyll cells the photosynthates are loaded
into the phloem STEs The sucrose is actively transported against its concentration gradient a process requiring
ATP into the phloem cells using the electrochemical potential of the proton gradient This is coupled to the
uptake of sucrose with a carrier protein called the sucroseH symporter
Phloem STEs have reduced cytoplasmic contents and are connected by a sieve plate with pores that allow
for pressuredriven bulk flow or translocation of phloem sap Companion cells are associated with STEs They
assist with metabolic activities and produce energy for the STEs Figure 3036
Figure 3036 Phloem is comprised of cells called sievetube elements Phloem sap travels through perforations called
sieve tube plates Neighboring companion cells carry out metabolic functions for the sievetube elements and provide
them with energy Lateral sieve areas connect the sievetube elements to the companion cells
Once in the phloem the photosynthates are translocated to the closest sink Phloem sap is an aqueous solution
that contains up to 30 percent sugar minerals amino acids and plant growth regulators The high percentage of
sugar decreases s which decreases the total water potential and causes water to move by osmosis from the
adjacent xylem into the phloem tubes thereby increasing pressure This increase in total water potential causes
the bulk flow of phloem from source to sink Figure 3037 Sucrose concentration in the sink cells is lower
than in the phloem STEs because the sink sucrose has been metabolized for growth or converted to starch for
storage or other polymers such as cellulose for structural integrity Unloading at the sink end of the phloem tube
occurs by either diffusion or active transport of sucrose molecules from an area of high concentration to one of
low concentration Water diffuses from the phloem by osmosis and is then transpired or recycled via the xylem
back into the phloem sap
