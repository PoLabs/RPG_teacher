reviews became the guardians or police of the disciplines by acknowledging 
those scholars who acted according to these rules and excluding those who 
did not Professionalisation also changed how certain scholars regarded their 
larger community the nation Historians from Central Europe for instance 
tended to act less as fathers of the nation and saw themselves more as part of 
a scientific community that respected scientific standards even if this meant 
sometimes challenging the prevailing ideology in their own nation In the late 
nineteenth century Czech philologists and historians exposed Vclav Hankas

as an example In the countryside reading societies were created in order to 
fight an enemy of the national ideal one that was more acrimonious than the 
censorship of the imperial state indifference 
Instruction in the mother tongue was a central aim in many parts of Europe
