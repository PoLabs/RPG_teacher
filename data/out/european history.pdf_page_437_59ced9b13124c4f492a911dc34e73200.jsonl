417
centres workers joined troops in the revolt and formed councils much like the 
Russian soviets Germany then fell prey to generalised unrest in January 1919 
the Spartacists the revolutionary far left disappointed with the progress 
of the revolution decided to take over Berlin In Hungary and Austria too 
communist parties founded by charismatic leaders met with varied success 
All these movements were quickly subjected to fierce repression In Germany 
the army and the Freikorps heterogeneous volunteer armies violently crushed 
the Spartacist insurrection In Hungary counterrevolutionaries received the 
support of the Allied troops occupying the country the Romanian intervention 
in JulyAugust 1919 sounded the death knell for the Hungarian communists 
Bela Kun had to flee to Russia and Admiral Horthy began an authoritarian 
regency 
In the other European countries governments reacted differently to the 
revolutionary strikes that followed the war In France trade union leaders 
were arrested and the main left trade union Confdration Gnrale du Travail 
CGT was declared illegal In Italy the government depended on the support 
of many large industrialists and landlords enabling the fascists and Mussolini 
to extend their influence In Britain the army put down the railway workers 
strike In Spain waves of peasant revolts and strikes led by socialists and 
anarchists were severely and drastically put down by the government and the 
employers federation By 1920 with the exception of Soviet Russiathe focal 
point of the revolutionrevolutionary movements were ending in failure 
throughout Europe
The economic crisis that hit European countries in the 1930s improved the 
fortunes of both right and leftwing movements The struggle between them 
often degenerated into street clashes In Italy and in Germany dictatorships 
set to work mitigating the effects of the economic crisis and reorienting their 
economies towards the preparation for war while also restricting public and 
individual liberties Poland and Hungary offered examples of authoritarian 
regimes that were not strictly fascist in nature Pisudski carried out a policy 
of cleaning up political life by using forceful decrees and censorship Sanacja 
while Horthy steered Hungary along the path of nationalist and antisemitic 
conservatism In Spain the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera failed in 1930 
partly due to the economic crisis and partly because of dynastic republican 
nationalist and extremeleft opposition
Communism though had the wind in its sails in the 1930s It was 
strengthened by the difficulties caused by economic crisis the lack of enthusiasm 
among Europeans for the apparent inefficiencies of liberal democracy and by 
the hopes of youth that had not given up the dream of an ideal society This 
partly explains the favour enjoyed by the young communist movement 
The extreme right also experienced a resurgence However fascist parties 
and reactionary formations in the countries of Western and Northern Europe
