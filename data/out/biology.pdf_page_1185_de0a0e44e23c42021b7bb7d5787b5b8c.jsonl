and T4 from the thyroid gland
thyroid hormone containing 4 iodines that controls the basal metabolic rate
thyroid hormone containing 3 iodines that controls the basal metabolic rate
an increase in the number of hormone receptors in response to increased hormone levels
CHAPTER SUMMARY
371 Types of Hormones
There are three basic types of hormones lipidderived amino acidderived and peptide Lipidderived
hormones are structurally similar to cholesterol and include steroid hormones such as estradiol and
testosterone Amino acidderived hormones are relatively small molecules and include the adrenal hormones
epinephrine and norepinephrine Peptide hormones are polypeptide chains or proteins and include the pituitary
hormones antidiuretic hormone vasopressin and oxytocin
372 How Hormones Work
Hormones cause cellular changes by binding to receptors on target cells The number of receptors on a target
cell can increase or decrease in response to hormone activity Hormones can affect cells directly through
intracellular hormone receptors or indirectly through plasma membrane hormone receptors
Lipidderived soluble hormones can enter the cell by diffusing across the plasma membrane and binding to
DNA to regulate gene transcription and to change the cells activities by inducing production of proteins that
affect in general the longterm structure and function of the cell Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on
the plasma membrane surface and trigger a signaling pathway to change the cells activities by inducing
production of various cell products that affect the cell in the shortterm The hormone is called a first messenger
and the cellular component is called a second messenger Gproteins activate the second messenger cyclic
AMP triggering the cellular response Response to hormone binding is amplified as the signaling pathway
progresses Cellular responses to hormones include the production of proteins and enzymes and altered
membrane permeability
373 Regulation of Body Processes
Water levels in the body are controlled by antidiuretic hormone ADH which is produced in the hypothalamus
and triggers the reabsorption of water by the kidneys Underproduction of ADH can cause diabetes insipidus
Aldosterone a hormone produced by the adrenal cortex of the kidneys enhances Na reabsorption from the
extracellular fluids and subsequent water reabsorption by diffusion The reninangiotensinaldosterone system
is one way that aldosterone release is controlled
The reproductive system is controlled by the gonadotropins folliclestimulating hormone FSH and luteinizing
hormone LH which are produced by the pituitary gland Gonadotropin release is controlled by the
hypothalamic hormone gonadotropinreleasing hormone GnRH FSH stimulates the maturation of sperm cells
in males and is inhibited by the hormone inhibin while LH stimulates the production of the androgen
testosterone FSH stimulates egg maturation in females while LH stimulates the production of estrogens and
progesterone Estrogens are a group of steroid hormones produced by the ovaries that trigger the development
of secondary sex characteristics in females as well as control the maturation of the ova In females the pituitary
also produces prolactin which stimulates milk production after childbirth and oxytocin which stimulates uterine
contraction during childbirth and milk letdown during suckling
Insulin is produced by the pancreas in response to rising blood glucose levels and allows cells to utilize blood
glucose and store excess glucose for later use Diabetes mellitus is caused by reduced insulin activity and
causes high blood glucose levels or hyperglycemia Glucagon is released by the pancreas in response to low
blood glucose levels and stimulates the breakdown of glycogen into glucose which can be used by the body
The bodys basal metabolic rate is controlled by the thyroid hormones thyroxine T4 and triiodothyronine T3
The anterior pituitary produces thyroid stimulating hormone TSH which controls the release of T3 and T4 from
the thyroid gland Iodine is necessary in the production of thyroid hormone and the lack of iodine can lead to a
condition called goiter
Parathyroid hormone PTH is produced by the parathyroid glands in response to low blood Ca2 levels The
