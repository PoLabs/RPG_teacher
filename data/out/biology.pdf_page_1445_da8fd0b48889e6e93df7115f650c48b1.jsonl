is an example of a commensal relationship in which one species the bird benefits while the other the tree neither
benefits nor is harmed credit HanayWikimedia Commons
Mutualism
A second type of symbiotic relationship is called mutualism where two species benefit from their interaction
Some scientists believe that these are the only true examples of symbiosis For example termites have a
mutualistic relationship with protozoa that live in the insects gut Figure 4526a The termite benefits from the
ability of bacterial symbionts within the protozoa to digest cellulose The termite itself cannot do this and without
the protozoa it would not be able to obtain energy from its food cellulose from the wood it chews and eats
The protozoa and the bacterial symbionts benefit by having a protective environment and a constant supply of
food from the wood chewing actions of the termite Lichens have a mutualistic relationship between fungus and
photosynthetic algae or bacteria Figure 4526b As these symbionts grow together the glucose produced by
the algae provides nourishment for both organisms whereas the physical structure of the lichen protects the
algae from the elements and makes certain nutrients in the atmosphere more available to the algae

Parasitism
A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it In this
relationship the parasite benefits but the host is harmed The host is usually weakened by the parasite as it
siphons resources the host would normally use to maintain itself The parasite however is unlikely to kill the
host especially not quickly because this would allow no time for the organism to complete its reproductive cycle
by spreading to another host
The reproductive cycles of parasites are often very complex sometimes requiring more than one host species
A tapeworm is a parasite that causes disease in humans when contaminated undercooked meat is consumed
