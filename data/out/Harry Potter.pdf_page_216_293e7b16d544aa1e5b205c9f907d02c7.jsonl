and Ive only just got away I dont know where Snape went
Well thats it then isnt it Harry said
The other two stared at him He was pale and his eyes were glittering
Im going out of here tonight and Im going to try and get to the Stone
first
Youre mad said Ron
You cant said Hermione After what McGonagall and Snape have said
Youll be expelled
SO WHAP Harry shouted Dont you understand If Snape gets hold of
the Stone Voldemorts coming back Havent you heard what it was like
when he was trying to take over There wont be any Hogwarts to get
expelled from Hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the Dark
Arts Losing points doesnt matter anymore cant you see Dyou think
hell leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house
cup If I get caught before I can get to the Stone well Ill have to
go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there its
only dying a bit later than I would have because Im never going over
to the Dark Side Im going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing
you two say is going to stop me Voldemort killed my parents remember
He glared at them
Youre right Harry said Hermione in a small voice
Ill use the invisibility cloak said Harry Its just lucky I got it
back
But will it cover all three of us said Ron
All  all three of us
Oh come off it you dont think wed let you go alone
Of course not said Hermione briskly How do you think youd get to
the Stone without us Id better go and took through my books there
might be something useful
