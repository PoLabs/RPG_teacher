the salivary glands mixes with the food Saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals
There are three major glands that secrete salivathe parotid the submandibular and the sublingual Saliva
contains mucus that moistens food and buffers the pH of the food Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and
lysozymes which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria Saliva
also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into
a disaccharide called maltose Another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue Lipases are
a class of enzymes that can breakdown triglycerides The lingual lipase begins the breakdown of fat components
in the food The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called
the bolus for swallowing The tongue helps in swallowingmoving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx
The pharynx opens to two passageways the trachea which leads to the lungs and the esophagus which leads
to the stomach The trachea has an opening called the glottis which is covered by a cartilaginous flap called
the epiglottis When swallowing the epiglottis closes the glottis and food passes into the esophagus and not the
trachea This arrangement allows food to be kept out of the trachea
Figure 349 Digestion of food begins in the a oral cavity Food is masticated by teeth and moistened by saliva
secreted from the b salivary glands Enzymes in the saliva begin to digest starches and fats With the help of the
tongue the resulting bolus is moved into the esophagus by swallowing credit modification of work by the National

Esophagus
The esophagus is a tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach The chewed and softened food
passes through the esophagus after being swallowed The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo a series
of wave like movements called peristalsis that push the food toward the stomach as illustrated in Figure 3410
The peristalsis wave is unidirectionalit moves food from the mouth to the stomach and reverse movement is
not possible The peristaltic movement of the esophagus is an involuntary reflex it takes place in response to
the act of swallowing
