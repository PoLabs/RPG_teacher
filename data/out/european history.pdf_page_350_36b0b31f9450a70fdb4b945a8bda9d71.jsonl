UNIT 3 POWER AND CITIZENSHIP
330
rebellion is to talk of a takeover of central power in a state which in turn 
requires that some form of centralised state exists in the first place This was 
not the case in Europe before the late Middle Ages although states had also 
existed in ancient timesand thus presumably events that might qualify as 
revolutions took place Some regions of Europe were more precocious than 
others of course especially those in the south the Sicilian Vespers of 1282 a 
bloody event which saw Sicilians drive their French masters from the island 
may well have been the first revolution properly speaking It also shows 
another important feature of revolutions the participation of sections of the 
population and not just of a small elite in overthrowing a regimeotherwise 
we might more fittingly speak of a coup dtat a putsch or a palace revolt
Western Europe
Although the phenomenon of revolutions is quite a bit older than the term 
itself it was nevertheless relatively rare in premodern times for a regime to be 
overthrown The reason is simple states had been created and continued to be 
ruled by monarchs and their dynasties and while it might seem legitimate to 
depose a particular monarch deemed unfit to rule it was quite unthinkable to 
depose his or her dynastic kin altogether as state and dynasty were generally 
seen as one and the same The situation might be different though when a 
foreign dynasty took oversuch as in latethirteenthcentury Sicilyor when 
the rulers next of kin was foreign or considered as such This was the case 
with the midsixteenthcentury Spanish inheritance of the Netherlands or 
somewhat less conspicuously the Scottish Stuarts succession to the English 
throne in the early seventeenth century In both cases rebellion and ultimately 
revolution were caused by grave blunders and miscalculations on the part of 
the monarchsbut these mistakes were committed largely because the rulers 
did not sufficiently understand and respect the political traditions of their new 
dominions and were in turn accused of just this In both cases too it took 
many years for resistance to foment into rebellion and many more years for the 
latter to succeed Still they became fullblown revolutions involving all parts 
of the population and leading to the deposition of Philip II of Spain in 1581 
and even in the case of Charles I of England to the first public execution of a 
ruling monarch 1649 Both revolutions also led to republican regimes if only 
shortlived in England and never entirely without some monarchical traits in 
the Netherlands
These two major early modern revolutions had yet another feature in 
common a civil war that accompanied them In both instances opponents and 
defenders of the king fought each other over many years and in both cases 
different religious allegiances played a major part in this division which
