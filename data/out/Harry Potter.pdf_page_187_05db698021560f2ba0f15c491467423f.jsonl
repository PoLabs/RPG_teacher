Then one breakfast time Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid
He had written only two words Its hatching
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut Hermione
wouldnt hear of it
Hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon
hatching
Weve got lessons well get into trouble and thats nothing to what
Hagrids going to be in when someone finds out what hes doing 
Shut up Harry whispered
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen How
much had he heard Harry didnt like the look on Malfoys face at all
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end
Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrids with the other two during
morning break When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their
lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried
through the grounds to the edge of the forest Hagrid greeted them
looking flushed and excited
Its nearly out He ushered them inside
The egg was lying on the table There were deep cracks in it Something
was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it
They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated
breath
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open The baby
dragon flopped onto the table It wasnt exactly pretty Harry thought
it looked like a crumpled black umbrella Its spiny wings were huge
compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils
the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes
It sneezed A couple of sparks flew out of its snout
Isnt he beautiful Hagrid murmured He reached out a hand to stroke
the dragons head It snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs
