Amos Komensk Comenius the Moravian educator of European fame taught 
from 1650 in Srospatak and there wrote his Orbis Sensualium Pictus 1658 
a multilingual elementary textbook with illustrative engravings Moving to 
Leszno and then fleeing Catholic persecution he arrived in Amsterdam in 
1657 where plans to make him a professor at the local Athenaeum foundered 
Yet he exercised a profound influence on later generations of educators a 
consequence of his unabated activity in EnglishDutchGerman intellectual 
networks alongside his education theories regarding curricula that could 
fit the natural development of children His ideas were also central to the 
socalled Hartlib Circlea network of Protestant educational reformers who 
spanned the arc of Northern Europe from England to Bohemia The activities 
of these people led to modern practiceoriented subjects finding their ways 
into curricula including geography mathematics or experimental physics 
which incorporated the theories of Leibniz Wolff and Newton 
Yet despite the socalled scientific revolution it was the philological
historical humanist tradition that in Germany was drilled into every new 
generation until well into the eighteenth century It is often assumed that the 
devastation of the Thirty Years War destroyed the institutions and networks 
of learning but scholars teachers and the learned book trade proved 
remarkably resilient Individual German states might have attempted to exert 
rigid control over their educational systems but from a birdseye view the 
patchy territories of Germany showed not only a large number of schools 
and universities but also a highly diverse and incredibly competitive market 
Political fragmentation did not cripple the educational system but enriched 
it Latin schools proved tremendously flexible and independent in attending 
to local needs and regional competition Despite the constant adaptations in 
pedagogical method in the daily routine there was little taught or discovered 
that was truly innovative Ramism a procedural system of classification 
expounded by the French philosopher Pierre de la Rame 15151572 as an 
alternative to Aristotelian categorisations proved very popular in the schools 
of central Germany in the seventeenth century Latin schools were often centres 
of learning outside courts and academia German Latin schools played a 
crucial double role in education their lowest forms were tailored to a German
speaking market of artisan families while their higher forms targeted aspiring 
students These schools were successful in enhancing the social mobility of 
familiesnot quickly but steadily over generations
The mobility of scholars was not only caused by wars and persecution It 
tied in with a generationsold practice of students travelling around Europe 
for educational reasons As part of their peregrinatio academica or gelehrte Reise 
or Kavalierstour students and noblemen toured the universities of Europe
