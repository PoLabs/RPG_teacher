Introduction
Over the course of the twentieth century Europeans the European 
environment and their mutual relationship underwent dramatic changes The 
acceleration of industrialisation at the turn of the century amplified existing 
problems like water and air pollution So too did two catastrophic World 
Wars which dramatically affected humans and their environment bombshell
scared landscapes are still seen today phosphor from sunken munitions is 
often mistaken for amber on the beaches on the Baltic Sea 
As the Cold War developed Europe was separated into two opposing 
blocscommunist and capitalistdemocratic As much as these two were 
ideologically opposed both sides still shared a strong faith in planning which 
would have an important impact on the environment Belief in a scientific
technological revolution in the East and systematic modelling of the future 
in the West led to the construction of largescale infrastructure projects 
which exacerbated environmental problems that had already emerged with 
industrialisation in the nineteenth century 
The world beyond Europe had also been environmentally divided into 
North and South A mechanised chemically intensive agricultural sector 
and the development of mass consumption generated new environmental 
questions regarding waste deposits and energy supplies for example or the 
outsourcing of environmental problems from richer to poorer countries By 
the 1970s the environmental crisis had caught up with European societies the 
environment became established as a political field an object of diplomacy a 
topic of public as well as scientific debate and an issue for social movements
