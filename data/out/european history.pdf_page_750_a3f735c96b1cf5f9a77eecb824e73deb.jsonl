The school of natural law further deepened this autonomy and definitively 
changed the way of thinking about politics in Europe through the promotion 
of law The German jurist Samuel von Pufendorf 16321694 sought to make 
this discipline a universal science based on a law of sociability that obliges 
everyone to respect each others commitments According to Pufendorf the 
rules of natural law were first and foremost those of the conservation of life 
Therefore the political contract must aim at the safety of free individuals The 
Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius 15831645 adopted the same approach convinced 
of the existence of a law common to all peoples He laid the foundations of the 
law of war in On the Law of War and Peace published in 1625 
The works of English philosophers Thomas Hobbes 15881679 and John 
Locke 16321704 stem from this same individualism this same concern for 
peace and security Moreover the doctrine of natural law allowed any power 
to be justified as long as it appeared reasonable and useful to society Thus 
as absolutism lost ground theories of natural law took on a different political 
content from that of Grotius or Pufendorf For Thomas Hobbes the individuals 
right to selfpreservation justified absolutism As a rationalist Hobbes 
observes the laws of nature which dictate that men defend their property and 
hence surrender their rights to the prince The state both ecclesiastical and 
civil is thus the result of an irreversible contract and has the task of defending 
everyone and guaranteeing peace The influence of his magnum opus Leviathan 
published in 1651 was farreaching On the one hand it sparked the disgust of 
Catholics Anglican bishops and libertarians but on the other hand it laid the 
foundations for a mechanistic political thinking that is still influential today 
John Lockes understanding of the nature of politics as a purely human 
activity was particularly influential He returned to the purpose of power from 
the reflections of Hobbes arguing that the great end for which men enter into 
society is to enjoy their goods in peace and security But unlike Hobbes Locke 
believed that the state of nature was a peaceful state of freedom and equality 
and that private property existed in this original state prior to civil society 
From then on all that the power in question must be used for is to make 
laws Locke is therefore a theorist of the superiority of legislative power As 
a result he considered in his work Two Treatises of Civil Government published 
in 1690 that in all states the first and fundamental positive law is that which 
establishes the legislative power His political theories are opposed to the 
ideas of the English theorist Robert Filmer 15881653 or the French bishop 
and author Bossuet 16271704 both of whom defended the divine right of 
kings For Bossuet royal authority is as with Locke paternal and reasonable 
but princes are seen as Gods lieutenants on earth their authority is therefore 
sacred 
With Locke Europe witnessed the ideological triumph of liberalism which 
according to historian Quentin Skinner not only discredited the neoRoman
