more complex protein and RNA products But there is an advantage to having a single compartment as well RNA
and protein synthesis occurs much more quickly in a prokaryotic cell 3 Figure 1421 If three nucleotides are added
one additional amino acid will be incorporated into the protein chain but the reading frame wont shift 4 C 6 D 8

21 Live R cells acquired genetic information from the heatkilled S cells that
transformed the R cells into S cells 23 If the tetranucleotide hypothesis were true then DNA would have to contain
equal amounts of all four nucleotides ATGC However Chargaff demonstrated that AT and GC but that the
four nucleotides are not present in equal amounts
25 DNA has two strands in antiparallel orientation The sugar
phosphate linkages form a backbone on the outside and the bases are paired on the inside A with T and G with
C like rungs on a spiral ladder 27 Meselsons experiments with E coli grown in 15N deduced this finding 29 At
an origin of replication two replication forks are formed that are extended in two directions On the lagging strand
Okazaki fragments are formed in a discontinuous manner 31 1333 seconds or 222 minutes 33 Primer provides a
3OH group for DNA pol to start adding nucleotides There would be no reaction in the tube without a primer and no
bands would be visible on the electrophoresis 35 Telomerase has an inbuilt RNA template that extends the 3 end so
primer is synthesized and extended Thus the ends are protected 37 This is a frameshift mutation with a deletion of
an A in the 12th position of the coding region

19 For 200 commonly occurring amino acids
codons consisting of four types of nucleotides would have to be at least four nucleotides long because 44  256 There
would be much less degeneracy in this case 21 Met Cys Arg Asn Ser Arg The first step to writing the amino acid
sequence is to find the start codon AUG Then the nucleotide sequence is separated into triplets CU AUG UGU CGU
AAC AGC CGA UGA We stop the translation at UGA because that triplet encodes a stop codon When we convert
these codons to amino acids the sequence becomes Met Cys Arg Asn Ser Arg 23 Rhodependent termination is
controlled by the rho protein which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain Near the end
of the gene the polymerase stalls at a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template The rho protein collides with the
polymerase and releases mRNA from the transcription bubble Rhoindependent termination is controlled by specific
sequences in the DNA template strand As the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed it encounters
a region rich in CG nucleotides This creates an mRNA hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall right as it begins
to transcribe a region rich in AT nucleotides Because AU bonds are less thermostable the core enzyme falls
away 25 To determine that a RNA polymerase I mutation or deficiency is causing the defect in protein production
the scientist would need to make observations that provide evidence that RNA polymerases II and III are working in
the cell The observations eliminating RNA polymerase II as the defect could include
Transcription of mRNAs

could include
Isolation of small nuclear RNAs from the cellIsolation of microRNAs from the cellTranscription of
5S rRNA in the nucleusPresence of tRNAs in the cytoplasm The observations implicating RNA polymerase I could
include
A lack of functional ribosomes in the cytoplasm RNA polymerase I or IIIA lack of RNA polymerase

The protein would be MAGY Even though there are six codons the fifth codon corresponds to a stop so the sixth
codon would not be translated 29 Original mRNA 5 UGCC AUG GUA AUA ACA CAU GAG GCC UGA AC 3

because they shift the reading frame for the codons This changes the amino acids encoded by the mRNA and can
introduce premature start or stop sites
