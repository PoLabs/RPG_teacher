Ron grunted in his sleep Should Harry wake him Something held him back
 his fathers cloak  he felt that this time  the first time  he
wanted to use it alone
He crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room
and climbed through the portrait hole
Whos there squawked the Fat Lady Harry said nothing He walked
