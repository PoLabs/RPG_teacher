by the purine guanine Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine or vice
versa for example cytosine a pyrimidine is replaced by adenine a purine Some point mutations are not
expressed these are known as silent mutations Silent mutations are usually due to a substitution in the third
base of a codon which often represents the same amino acid as the original codon Other point mutations
can result in the replacement of one amino acid by another which may alter the function of the protein Point
mutations that generate a stop codon can terminate a protein early
Some mutations can result in an increased number of copies of the same codon These are called trinucleotide
repeat expansions and result in repeated regions of the same amino acid Mutations can also be the result of
the addition of a base known as an insertion or the removal of a base also known as deletion If an insertion or
deletion results in the alteration of the translational reading frame a frameshift mutation the resultant protein
is usually nonfunctional Sometimes a piece of DNA from one chromosome may get translocated to another
chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome this is also known as translocation These mutation
types are shown in Figure 1421
Figure 1421 Mutations can lead to changes in the protein sequence encoded by the DNA
A frameshift mutation that results in the insertion of three nucleotides is often less deleterious than a
mutation that results in the insertion of one nucleotide Why
Mutations in repair genes have been known to cause cancer Many mutated repair genes have been implicated
in certain forms of pancreatic cancer colon cancer and colorectal cancer Mutations can affect either somatic
cells or germ cells If many mutations accumulate in a somatic cell they may lead to problems such as the
uncontrolled cell division observed in cancer If a mutation takes place in germ cells the mutation will be passed
on to the next generation as in the case of hemophilia and xeroderma pigmentosa
