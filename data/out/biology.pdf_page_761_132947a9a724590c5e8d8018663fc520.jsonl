264  The Role of Seed Plants
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how angiosperm diversity is due in part to multiple complex interactions with animals

Describe ways in which pollination occurs

Discuss the roles that plants play in ecosystems and how deforestation threatens plant biodiversity
Without seed plants life as we know it would not be possible Plants play a key role in the maintenance of
terrestrial ecosystems through the stabilization of soils cycling of carbon and climate moderation Large tropical
forests release oxygen and act as carbon dioxide sinks Seed plants provide shelter to many life forms as well
as food for herbivores thereby indirectly feeding carnivores Plant secondary metabolites are used for medicinal
purposes and industrial production Virtually all animal life is dependent on plants for survival
Animals and Plants Herbivory
Coevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support
especially because both angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle Mesozoic
Many authors have attributed the diversity of plants and insects to both pollination and herbivory or the
consumption of plants by insects and other animals Herbivory is believed to have been as much a driving force
as pollination Coevolution of herbivores and plant defenses is easily and commonly observed in nature Unlike
animals most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry animals although mimicry
has been used to entice pollinators A sort of arms race exists between plants and herbivores To combat
herbivores some plant seedssuch as acorn and unripened persimmonare high in alkaloids and therefore
unsavory to some animals Other plants are protected by bark although some animals developed specialized
mouth pieces to tear and chew vegetal material Spines and thorns Figure 2620 deter most animals except
for mammals with thick fur and some birds have specialized beaks to get past such defenses

Herbivory has been exploited by seed plants for their own benefit The dispersal of fruits by herbivorous animals
is a striking example of mutualistic relationships The plant offers to the herbivore a nutritious source of food in
return for spreading the plants genetic material to a wider area
An extreme example of coevolution discovered by Dan Jansen between an animal and a plant is exemplified
by Mexican acacia trees and their attendant acacia ants Pseudomyrmex spp this is termed myrmecophytism
The trees support the ants with shelter and food The ants nest in the hollows of large thorns produced by the
tree and feed on sugary secretions produced at the ends of the leaves The sugar pellets also help to keep
the ants from interfering with insect pollinators In return ants discourage herbivores both invertebrates and
vertebrates by stinging and attacking leafeaters and insects ovipositing on the plants The ants also help to
remove potential plant pathogens such as fungal growths Another case of insectplant coevolution is found in
bracken fern Pteridium aquinilum whose subspecies are found throughout the world Bracken ferns produce
a number of secondary plant compounds in their adult fronds that serve as defensive compounds against
nonadapted insect attack these compounds include cyanogenic glucosides tannins and phenolics However
