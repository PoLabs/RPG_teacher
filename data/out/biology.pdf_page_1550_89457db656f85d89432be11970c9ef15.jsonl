cell 30 To determine the function of a specific brain area scientists can look at patients who have damage in that brain
area and see what symptoms they exhibit Researchers can disable the brain structure temporarily using transcranial
magnetic stimulation They can disable or remove the area in an animal model fMRI can be used to correlate specific
functions with increased blood flow to brain regions 32 Potential answers
Frontal lobe Alzheimers patients
experience changes in personality judgment and behaviorParietal lobe Alzheimers patients experience difficulties
with recalling and using language as disease progressesTemporal lobe The hippocampus is one of the main areas of
the brain affected in Alzheimers disease Patients lose the ability to make new memories and access memories 34
The sensorysomatic nervous system transmits sensory information from the skin muscles and sensory organs
to the CNS It also sends motor commands from the CNS to the muscles causing them to contract 36 Many
events in modern human life are not physical dangers instead they are events we think of as stress Finding the
money to pay your student loans or being nervous before a test still activate the sympathetic nervous system but
these situations do not require the fightorflight response to survive
38 Possible treatments for patients with major
depression include psychotherapy and prescription medications MAO inhibitor drugs inhibit the breakdown of certain
neurotransmitters including dopamine serotonin norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft SSRI medications inhibit the
reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron

sensory information from the receptor to the central nervous system will be impaired and thus perception of stimuli
which occurs in the brain will be halted 26 General sensory receptors are located throughout the body in the skin
and internal organs Conversely special senses are all located in the head region and require specialized organs
28 Pain is a subjective sensation that relies on the brain interpreting the nociception signals received by the sensory
receptors perception Therefore even though two people experience identical stimuli their brains can perceive them
as very different sensory experiences
30 The animal might not be able to recognize the differences in food sources
and thus might not be able to discriminate between spoiled food and safe food or between foods that contain necessary
nutrients such as proteins and foods that do not 32 The sound would slow down because it is transmitted through
the particles gas and there are fewer particles lower density at higher altitudes 34 The first step in processing a
sound in humans is the collection of sound by the pinna When a person encounters a sound the pinna on both sides
of the head will collect the vibrations Since the waves originate from a single site the two pinnae will not collect the
sound at the exact same time When the sound is processed by the auditory system the brain is able to use this slight
difference in timing to determine the location of the sound
36 The photoreceptors tonically inhibit the bipolar cells
and stimulation of the receptors turns this inhibition off activating the bipolar cells

21 Although there are many different hormones in the human body they can be divided into
three classes based on their chemical structure lipidderived amino acidderived and peptide hormones One of the
key distinguishing features of the lipidderived hormones is that they can diffuse across plasma membranes whereas
the amino acidderived and peptide hormones cannot 23 Glucagon acts in opposition to insulin the peptide hormone
that stimulates cells to take up glucose from the bloodstream to maintain blood glucose within healthy levels When
glucagon is released into the blood in response to falling blood sugar levels the liver catabolizes its glycogen stores
to release glucose If glucagon does not function properly the blood sugar will drop too low from insulin signaling
driving cellular uptake from the blood
25 Depending on the location of the protein receptor on the target cell and the
chemical structure of the hormone hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to intracellular receptors and
modulating gene transcription or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways 27
In addition to producing FSH and LH the anterior pituitary also produces the hormone prolactin PRL in females
Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth Prolactin levels are regulated
by the hypothalamic hormones prolactinreleasing hormone PRH and prolactininhibiting hormone PIH which is now
known to be dopamine PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it The posterior pituitary releases the
hormone oxytocin which stimulates contractions during childbirth The uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive
to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks Stretching of tissues
in the uterus and vagina stimulates oxytocin release in childbirth Contractions increase in intensity as blood levels of
oxytocin rise until the birth is complete 29 The stressed patients that catch a cold must be chronically longterm
stressed Longterm stress results in the production of glucocorticoids such as cortisol These hormones inhibit the
function of the immune system which makes people more susceptible to infectious diseases
31 The term humoral is
derived from the term humor which refers to bodily fluids such as blood Humoral stimuli refer to the control of hormone
release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the ion concentration in the blood For example
a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release of insulin Insulin causes blood glucose levels to drop
which signals the pancreas to stop producing insulin in a negative feedback loop Hormonal stimuli refer to the release
