Minerals and Their Function in the Human Body
Mineral
Function
Deficiencies Can
Lead To
Sources
Chlorine
Needed for production of hydrochloric
acid HCl in the stomach and nerve
function osmotic balance
Muscle cramps mood
disturbances reduced
appetite
Table salt
Copper
trace
amounts
Required component of many redox
enzymes including cytochrome c
oxidase cofactor for hemoglobin
synthesis
Copper deficiency is
rare
Liver oysters cocoa
chocolate sesame nuts
Iodine
Required for the synthesis of thyroid
hormones
Goiter
Seafood iodized salt dairy
products
Iron
Required for many proteins and
enzymes notably hemoglobin to
prevent anemia
Anemia which causes
poor concentration
fatigue and poor
immune function
Red meat leafy green
vegetables fish tuna
salmon eggs dried fruits
beans whole grains
Magnesium
Required cofactor for ATP formation
bone formation normal membrane
functions muscle function
Mood disturbances
muscle spasms
Whole grains leafy green
vegetables
Manganese
trace
amounts
A cofactor in enzyme functions trace
amounts are required
Manganese deficiency
is rare
Common in most foods
Molybdenum
trace
amounts
Acts as a cofactor for three essential
enzymes in humans sulfite oxidase
xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase
Molybdenum deficiency
is rare
Phosphorus
A component of bones and teeth helps
regulate acidbase balance nucleotide
synthesis
Weakness bone
abnormalities calcium
loss
Milk hard cheese whole
grains meats
Potassium
Vital for muscles heart and nerve
function
Cardiac rhythm
disturbance muscle
weakness
Legumes potato skin
tomatoes bananas
Selenium
trace
amounts
A cofactor essential to activity of
antioxidant enzymes like glutathione
peroxidase trace amounts are required
Selenium deficiency is
rare
Common in most foods
Sodium
Systemic electrolyte required for many
functions acidbase balance water
balance nerve function
Muscle cramps
fatigue reduced
appetite
Table salt
Zinc trace
amounts
Required for several enzymes such as
carboxypeptidase liver alcohol
dehydrogenase and carbonic
anhydrase
Anemia poor wound
healing can lead to
short stature
Common in most foods
Greater than 200mgday required
