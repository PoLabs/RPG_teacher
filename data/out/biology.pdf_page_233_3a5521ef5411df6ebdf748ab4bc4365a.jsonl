KEY TERMS
combination of an acetyl group derived from pyruvic acid and coenzyme A which is made from
pantothenic acid a Bgroup vitamin
process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen
process that does not use oxygen
process in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of
oxygen
also F1F0 ATP synthase membraneembedded protein complex that adds a phosphate to ADP
with energy from protons diffusing through it
process in which there is a production of adenosine triphosphate ATP in cellular metabolism
by the involvement of a proton gradient across a membrane
also Krebs cycle series of enzymecatalyzed chemical reactions of central importance in all
living cells for extraction of energy from carbohydrates
removal of a phosphate group from a molecule
process of regenerating NAD with either an inorganic or organic compound serving as the final
electron acceptor occurs in the absence of oxygen
integral membrane protein that transports glucose
process of breaking glucose into two threecarbon molecules with the production of ATP and NADH
enzyme that converts a molecule into its isomer
also citric acid cycle alternate name for the citric acid cycle named after Hans Krebs who first
identified the steps in the pathway in the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles see citric acid cycle
production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis in the presence of oxygen
addition of a highenergy phosphate to a compound usually a metabolic intermediate a
protein or ADP
also prosthetic cofactor molecule bound to a protein that facilitates the function of the
protein
threecarbon sugar that can be decarboxylated and oxidized to make acetyl CoA which enters the
citric acid cycle under aerobic conditions the end product of glycolysis
chemical reaction that consists of the coupling of an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction
production of ATP from ADP using the excess energy from a chemical
reaction and a phosphate group from a reactant
also citric acid cycle alternate name for the citric acid cycle named after the group name for citric
acid tricarboxylic acid TCA see citric acid cycle
soluble electron transporter in the electron transport chain that connects the first or second complex
to the third
