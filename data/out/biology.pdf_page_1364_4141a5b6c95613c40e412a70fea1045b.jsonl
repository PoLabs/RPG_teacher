The gestation period is divided into three equal periods or trimesters During the first two to four weeks of
the first trimester nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion As the trimester
progresses the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium and the placenta forms This
organ takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus with the mothers blood passing
nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it Chemicals from the fetus such as bilirubin are processed
by the mothers liver for elimination Some of the mothers immunoglobulins will pass through the placenta
providing passive immunity against some potential infections
Internal organs and body structures begin to develop during the first trimester By five weeks limb buds eyes
the heart and liver have been basically formed By eight weeks the term fetus applies and the body is
essentially formed as shown in Figure 4319 The individual is about five centimeters two inches in length
and many of the organs such as the lungs and liver are not yet functioning Exposure to any toxins is
especially dangerous during the first trimester as all of the bodys organs and structures are going through initial
development Anything that affects that development can have a severe effect on the fetus survival
