established that sovereignty resides essentially in the nation and therefore 
the right to establish its fundamental laws belongs exclusively to it
Accordingly those scholars who understand the nation in its modern sense 
as a product of this Age of Revolution stress its artificial nature nations were 
constructed by state and capitalist institutions to provide common elements 
with which citizens could identify and operate such as a common past the 
national history taught in public schools and displayed in national museums 
or a national market supervised by the state Notably Benedict Anderson 
described the modern nation as an imagined community imagined both 
as sovereign and limited because no nation identifies itself with humanity 
In such communities horizontal personal ties among its members became 
central One of the goals of the liberal revolutions was to construct a community 
of equals in order to eradicate the legal privileges and inequalities that had 
characterised the ancien rgime Equality before the law would allow citizens to 
identify with their compatriots equals in rights and duties thus strengthening 
national commitment
From this perspective nations were built through political and cultural 
actions by which states sought to turn the inhabitants of their territory 
into participants of a political community Nationhood would provide this 
community with a cultural identity through the establishment of national 
myths traditions and shared symbols usually those of the dominant ethnic 
group in the territory
Nations therefore were not predetermined when the nineteenth century 
began Rather they were rooted in the convictions of the individuals that 
formed them and the result of theoretical elaborations of political and cultural 
agents selfproclaimed nationalists or patriots Initially nationalist activists 
cooperated in transnational networks vowing allegiance to the mutual cause 
of building a continent or world of nationstates Italian intellectuals cherished 
the idea of a shared fate between Italy and Germany and used it to win over 
the hearts and minds of German nationalists In central Europe contrary to the 
image of hermeticallysealed national cultures important intellectuals from 
different national groups often maintained tight connections with figures from 
rival nations They were educated at western European universities which 
ensured the transfer of western European ideas 
Such a social constructivist view should not however imply that any 
national project was viable in the nineteenth century Some scholars argue that 
for a nation to be feasible it must spring from existing political structures that 
are attached to the common experiences of its citizens or from the existence of 
ethnic groups defined by Anthony Smith as human groups linked to a mythic
symbolic system that typically preserves the idea of a common origin Even if 
ethnic groups were not natural units they were able to maintain themselves
