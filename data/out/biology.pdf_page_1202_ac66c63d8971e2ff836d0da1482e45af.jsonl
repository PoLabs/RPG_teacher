Long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends The diaphysis or central shaft
contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity The rounded ends the epiphyses are covered with articular cartilage
and are filled with red bone marrow which produces blood cells Figure 3817 Most of the limb bones are long
bonesfor example the femur tibia ulna and radius Exceptions to this include the patella and the bones of
the wrist and ankle
Figure 3817 The long bone is covered by articular cartilage at either end and contains bone marrow shown in yellow
in this illustration in the marrow cavity
Short bones or cuboidal bones are bones that are the same width and length giving them a cubelike shape
For example the bones of the wrist carpals and ankle tarsals are short bones Figure 3816
Flat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or
where broad surfaces of muscle attachment are required Examples of flat bones are the sternum breast bone
ribs scapulae shoulder blades and the roof of the skull Figure 3816
Irregular bones are bones with complex shapes These bones may have short flat notched or ridged surfaces
Examples of irregular bones are the vertebrae hip bones and several skull bones
Sesamoid bones are small flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed The patellae are sesamoid
bones Figure 3818 Sesamoid bones develop inside tendons and may be found near joints at the knees
hands and feet
