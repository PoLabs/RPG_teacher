The search for alternative ways of living was also reflected in the rise of early 
science fiction novels such as News from Nowhere by the British artist William 
Morris 18341896 Published in 1890 the novel is set 200 years in the future 
after a violent socialist revolution has brought about a society without private 
property a monetary system marriage or divorce courts and prisons There 
are no big polluted cities anymore and poverty and misery have disappeared 
The ideas of SaintSimon and Fourier also had an important influence on 
the French Revolution of 1848 and the Paris Commune of 1871 Arguably the 
Commune the shortlived revolutionary government that seized power in the 
French capital following the defeat in the FrancoPrussian War of 18701871 
was the most famous and influential utopian experiment of the century The 
Commune drew up an ambitious programme of socialist selfrule based on 
collaboration and cooperation including measures like free education the 
nationalisation of church property and the liberalisation of marriage laws 
Although it was crushed after a little over two months and only a few of the 
planned measures were implemented during its existence the Commune 
became an important inspiration for socialist movements around the world
Painting and Sculpture
During the revolutionary upheavals that shook the continent art was seen 
as a force for social change This sentiment was reflected in the military 
origins of the term avantgarde which put artists in the same category as the 
revolutionaries fighting on the barricades For example during the days of the 
Commune the Federation of Artists was established to support young artists 
and unorthodox styles 
The jurors of the Salonthe annual exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts 
in Paris that exerted a major influence on the European art world during the 
nineteenth centurydisapproved of this idea of a socially engaged art They 
rejected many innovative works that are now considered masterpieces and 
by the 1860s the salons were seen as staid and outmoded In a review from 
1866 the French novelist and journalist mile Zola 18401902 decried the 
conventional nature of most exhibited works which in the face of the changes 
of their time amounted to escapism Confronted with the invasion of science 
and industry artists in reaction throw themselves into a dream into a shoddy 
heaven of tinsel and tissue paper By then the mounting public pressure had 
led to the establishment in 1863 of an associated exhibition of the rejected 
worksthe socalled Salon des Refuss This official acknowledgement is often 
seen as the birth of the avantgarde marking its beginning as the dominant 
force in European art and culture
