The Man with the Twisted Lip
An enemy
Yes one of my natural enemies or shall I say
my natural prey Briey Watson I am in the midst
of a very remarkable inquiry and I have hoped to
nd a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots
as I have done before now Had I been recognised
in that den my life would not have been worth an
hours purchase for I have used it before now for my
own purposes and the rascally Lascar who runs it
has sworn to have vengeance upon me There is a
trapdoor at the back of that building near the corner
of Pauls Wharf which could tell some strange tales
of what has passed through it upon the moonless
nights
What You do not mean bodies
Ay bodies Watson We should be rich men if we
had 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to
death in that den It is the vilest murdertrap on the
whole riverside and I fear that Neville St Clair has
entered it never to leave it more But our trap should
be here He put his two forengers between his teeth
and whistled shrillya signal which was answered by
a similar whistle from the distance followed shortly
by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs
Now Watson said Holmes as a tall dogcart
dashed up through the gloom throwing out two
golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns
Youll come with me wont you
If I can be of use
Oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a
chronicler still more so My room at The Cedars is a
doublebedded one
The Cedars
Yes that is Mr St Clairs house I am staying
there while I conduct the inquiry
Where is it then
Near Lee in Kent We have a sevenmile drive
before us
But I am all in the dark
Of course you are
Youll know all about it
presently Jump up here All right John we shall
not need you Heres half a crown Look out for me
tomorrow about eleven Give her her head So long
then
He icked the horse with his whip and we dashed
away through the endless succession of sombre and
deserted streets which widened gradually until we
were ying across a broad balustraded bridge with
the murky river owing sluggishly beneath us Be
yond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar
its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall
of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some
belated party of revellers A dull wrack was drift
ing slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled
dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds
Holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his
breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought
while I sat beside him curious to learn what this new
quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so
sorely and yet afraid to break in upon the current of
his thoughts We had driven several miles and were
beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban
villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoul
ders and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who
has satised himself that he is acting for the best
You have a grand gift of silence Watson said he
It makes you quite invaluable as a companion Pon
my word it is a great thing for me to have someone
to talk to for my own thoughts are not overpleasant
I was wondering what I should say to this dear little
woman tonight when she meets me at the door
You forget that I know nothing about it
I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the
case before we get to Lee It seems absurdly sim
ple and yet somehow I can get nothing to go upon
Theres plenty of thread no doubt but I cant get the
end of it into my hand Now Ill state the case clearly
and concisely to you Watson and maybe you can see
a spark where all is dark to me
Proceed then
Some
years
agoto
be
denite
in
May
1884there came to Lee a gentleman Neville St Clair
by name who appeared to have plenty of money He
took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely
and lived generally in good style
By degrees he
made friends in the neighbourhood and in 1887 he
married the daughter of a local brewer by whom he
now has two children He had no occupation but
was interested in several companies and went into
town as a rule in the morning returning by the 514
from Cannon Street every night Mr St Clair is now
thirtyseven years of age is a man of temperate habits
a good husband a very affectionate father and a man
who is popular with all who know him I may add
that his whole debts at the present moment as far as
we have been able to ascertain amount to 88 10s
while he has 220 standing to his credit in the Capital
and Counties Bank There is no reason therefore to
think that money troubles have been weighing upon
his mind
Last Monday Mr Neville St Clair went into town
rather earlier than usual remarking before he started
