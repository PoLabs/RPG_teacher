de Louvois 16411691 But France was also immensely strained under the 
pressure to maintain such a large army and navy and had to agree to the Treaty 
of Rijswijk 1697 that ended the War of the League of Augsburg forcing Louis 
XIV the socalled Sun King to return almost all the territory he had gained 
since 1679
European Warfare until Napoleon
The eighteenth century opened with a major conflict the War of the Spanish 
Succession 17011713 which was settled by the Peace of Utrecht 17131714 
Three features and consequences of the Peace of Utrecht would characterise 
geopolitics throughout the century the fall of France as the most powerful 
player in European politics the rise of Great Britain and Russia as major 
military powers and the increasing tendency for European conflicts to involve 
colonial territories far away from Europe The war began when Spanish King 
Charles II 16611700 died without an heir He declared Louis XIVs second 
grandson Philip Duke of Anjou 16831746 as his successor which the 
Austrian Emperor Leopold I 16401705 refused to accept France lost a series 
of battles against the Holy Roman Empire and England led by Prince Eugene 
16631736 and the Duke of Marlborough 16501722 respectively Under the 
terms of the Peace of Utrecht Philip was recognised as King but had to renounce 
any claims to the French throne thus barring unification of the kingdoms and 
France ceded territory in Canada to the British Newfoundland the Hudson 
Bay area and most of Nova Scotia Another succession war that of the Austrian 
Succession 17401748 occurred when Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI 
16851740 died without a male heir and the Prussian King Frederick II 
17121786 thought that Charles VIs daughter the newlycrowned Austrian 
Empress Maria Theresa 17171780 would be too weak to stop his invasion 
of the rich Austrian territory of Silesia France joined the fray to humiliate its 
longstanding enemies the Austrians and Great Britain allied with Austria to 
prevent the French from taking the Austrian Netherlands The Peace of Aixla
Chapelle 1748 that ended the conflict recognised Maria Theresa as Empress 
of Austria but she had to recognise Prussian control of Silesia Frederick IIs 
later Frederick the Greats Prussia became established as a great European 
power with the most efficient and wellorganised army of the era
The Peace of AixlaChapelle failed to resolve longstanding colonial 
disputes however and just eight years later in 1756 there occurred a major 
realignment of the European powers and the outbreak of what British Prime 
Minister Winston Churchill 18741965 would later famously call the first 
world war the Seven Years War 17561763 Prussia and Great Britain 
signed a defensive alliance which prompted Austria to overlook centuries of 
enmity with France and ally with Louis XV 17101774 in what historians
