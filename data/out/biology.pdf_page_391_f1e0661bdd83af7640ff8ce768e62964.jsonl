Figure 143 Two strains of S pneumoniae were used in Griffiths transformation experiments The R strain is non
pathogenic whereas the S strain is pathogenic and causes death When Griffith injected a mouse with the heatkilled
S strain and a live R strain the mouse died The S strain was recovered from the dead mouse Griffith concluded
that something had passed from the heatkilled S strain to the R strain transforming the R strain into the S strain in
the process credit living mouse modification of work by NIH credit dead mouse modification of work by Sarah

Scientists Oswald Avery Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty 1944 were interested in exploring this
transforming principle further They isolated the S strain from the dead mice and isolated the proteins and nucleic
acids RNA and DNA as these were possible candidates for the molecule of heredity They used enzymes that
specifically degraded each component and then used each mixture separately to transform the R strain They
found that when DNA was degraded the resulting mixture was no longer able to transform the bacteria whereas
all of the other combinations were able to transform the bacteria This led them to conclude that DNA was the
transforming principle
Forensic Scientists used DNA analysis evidence for the first time to solve an immigration case The story
started with a teenage boy returning to London from Ghana to be with his mother Immigration authorities
at the airport were suspicious of him thinking that he was traveling on a forged passport After much
persuasion he was allowed to go live with his mother but the immigration authorities did not drop the case
against him All types of evidence including photographs were provided to the authorities but deportation
proceedings were started nevertheless Around the same time Dr Alec Jeffreys of Leicester University in
the United Kingdom had invented a technique known as DNA fingerprinting The immigration authorities
approached Dr Jeffreys for help He took DNA samples from the mother and three of her children as well
as an unrelated mother and compared the samples with the boys DNA Because the biological father was
not in the picture DNA from the three children was compared with the boys DNA He found a match in the
boys DNA for both the mother and his three siblings He concluded that the boy was indeed the mothers
son
Forensic scientists analyze many items including documents handwriting firearms and biological
samples They analyze the DNA content of hair semen saliva and blood and compare it with a database
of DNA profiles of known criminals Analysis includes DNA isolation sequencing and sequence analysis
Forensic scientists are expected to appear at court hearings to present their findings They are usually
employed in crime labs of city and state government agencies Geneticists experimenting with DNA
techniques also work for scientific and research organizations pharmaceutical industries and college and
university labs Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist should have at least a bachelors
degree in chemistry biology or physics and preferably some experience working in a laboratory
Although the experiments of Avery McCarty and McLeod had demonstrated that DNA was the informational
component transferred during transformation DNA was still considered to be too simple a molecule to carry
biological information Proteins with their 20 different amino acids were regarded as more likely candidates
The decisive experiment conducted by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952 provided confirmatory
evidence that DNA was indeed the genetic material and not proteins Chase and Hershey were studying a
