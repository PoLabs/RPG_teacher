Responses and Intellectual Answers to Inequality 
Capitalism created stunning inequalities in the distribution of wealth and 
the first comprehensive intellectual and practical answer to these stunning 
inequalities was put forward by German philosophers Karl Marx 18181883 
and Friedrich Engels 18201895 In The Communist Manifesto published in 
1848 they argued that human history was the history of class struggle In their 
account capitalism had two main classes the bourgeoisie and the proletariat 
and the latter was exploited by the wealthy classes landed aristocracy and 
capitalists Following the death of their progenitor Karl Marx a schism split 
Marxist parties between two different perspectives on the path to power One 
perspective that of the communists argued that parliamentary democracies 
served the interests of the bourgeoisie and therefore the labour movement 
had to be revolutionary and conquer political power through the means of 
class struggle Social democrats on the other hand thought that universal 
suffrage would help the working classes to power without revolution While 
the communists were suspicious of the welfare measures of capitalist states 
which softened the revolutionary consciousness of the oppressed classes 
for social democrats universal suffrage which was expected to bring the 
socialist parties into political power and the economic programme of a welfare 
state creating a more proportionate wealth and income distribution through 
state measures was a means to achieve the social economic and cultural 
emancipation of the working classes 
The English historian E P Thompson originated the concept of moral 
economy 1971the idea that peasant communities share a set of normative 
attitudes concerning social relations and social behaviours that surround 
the local economy eg the availability of food the prices of subsistence 
commodities the proper administration of taxation and the operation of 
charity This is sometimes referred to as a subsistence ethic the idea that 
local social arrangements should be structured in such a way as to respect 
the subsistence needs of the rural poor The associated theory of political 
behaviour argues something like this peasant communities are aroused to 
protest and rebellion when the terms of the local subsistence ethic are breached 
by local elites state authorities or market forces The social reactions to the 
gross material inequalities that capitalism can trigger are varied the formation 
of protective workingclass associations such as trade unions or charities 
taxation social patronage the welfare state oras the most radical form of 
social changethe building of a communist society
