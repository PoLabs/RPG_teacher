92 Propagation of the Signal
Ligand binding to the receptor allows for signal transduction through the cell The chain of events that conveys
the signal through the cell is called a signaling pathway or cascade Signaling pathways are often very complex
because of the interplay between different proteins A major component of cell signaling cascades is the
phosphorylation of molecules by enzymes known as kinases Phosphorylation adds a phosphate group to
serine threonine and tyrosine residues in a protein changing their shapes and activating or inactivating the
protein Small molecules like nucleotides can also be phosphorylated Second messengers are small non
protein molecules that are used to transmit a signal within a cell Some examples of second messengers are
calcium ions Ca2 cyclic AMP cAMP diacylglycerol DAG and inositol triphosphate IP3
93 Response to the Signal
The initiation of a signaling pathway is a response to external stimuli This response can take many different
forms including protein synthesis a change in the cells metabolism cell growth or even cell death Many
pathways influence the cell by initiating gene expression and the methods utilized are quite numerous Some
pathways activate enzymes that interact with DNA transcription factors Others modify proteins and induce
them to change their location in the cell Depending on the status of the organism cells can respond by storing
energy as glycogen or fat or making it available in the form of glucose A signal transduction pathway allows
muscle cells to respond to immediate requirements for energy in the form of glucose Cell growth is almost
always stimulated by external signals called growth factors Uncontrolled cell growth leads to cancer and
mutations in the genes encoding protein components of signaling pathways are often found in tumor cells
Programmed cell death or apoptosis is important for removing damaged or unnecessary cells The use of
cellular signaling to organize the dismantling of a cell ensures that harmful molecules from the cytoplasm are
not released into the spaces between cells as they are in uncontrolled death necrosis Apoptosis also ensures
the efficient recycling of the components of the dead cell Termination of the cellular signaling cascade is very
important so that the response to a signal is appropriate in both timing and intensity Degradation of signaling
molecules and dephosphorylation of phosphorylated intermediates of the pathway by phosphatases are two
ways to terminate signals within the cell
94 Signaling in SingleCelled Organisms
Yeasts and multicellular organisms have similar signaling mechanisms Yeasts use cellsurface receptors and
signaling cascades to communicate information on mating with other yeast cells The signaling molecule
secreted by yeasts is called mating factor
Bacterial signaling is called quorum sensing Bacteria secrete signaling molecules called autoinducers that are
either small hydrophobic molecules or peptidebased signals The hydrophobic autoinducers such as AHL
bind transcription factors and directly affect gene expression The peptidebased molecules bind kinases and
initiate signaling cascades in the cells
