In humans there are five primary tastes and each taste has only one corresponding type of receptor Thus
like olfaction each receptor is specific to its stimulus tastant Transduction of the five tastes happens through
different mechanisms that reflect the molecular composition of the tastant A salty tastant containing NaCl
provides the sodium ions Na that enter the taste neurons and excite them directly Sour tastants are acids
and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family Binding of an acid or other sourtasting molecule triggers a
change in the ion channel and these increase hydrogen ion H concentrations in the taste neurons thus
depolarizing them Sweet bitter and umami tastants require a Gprotein coupled receptor These tastants bind
to their respective receptors thereby exciting the specialized neurons associated with them
Both tasting abilities and sense of smell change with age In humans the senses decline dramatically by age 50
and continue to decline A child may find a food to be too spicy whereas an elderly person may find the same
food to be bland and unappetizing
