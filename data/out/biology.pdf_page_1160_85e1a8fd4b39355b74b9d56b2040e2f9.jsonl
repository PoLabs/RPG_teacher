passes through the cell membrane the hormone that binds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while
the intracellular product remains inside the cell The hormone that initiates the signaling pathway is called a first
messenger which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm as illustrated in Figure 376
Figure 376 The amino acidderived hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine bind to betaadrenergic receptors on
the plasma membrane of cells Hormone binding to receptor activates a Gprotein which in turn activates adenylyl
cyclase converting ATP to cAMP cAMP is a second messenger that mediates a cellspecific response An enzyme
called phosphodiesterase breaks down cAMP terminating the signal
One very important second messenger is cyclic AMP cAMP When a hormone binds to its membrane receptor
a Gprotein that is associated with the receptor is activated Gproteins are proteins separate from receptors
that are found in the cell membrane When a hormone is not bound to the receptor the Gprotein is inactive and
is bound to guanosine diphosphate or GDP When a hormone binds to the receptor the Gprotein is activated
by binding guanosine triphosphate or GTP in place of GDP After binding GTP is hydrolysed by the Gprotein
into GDP and becomes inactive
The activated Gprotein in turn activates a membranebound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase Adenylyl cyclase
catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP cAMP in turn activates a group of proteins called protein kinases
which transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a substrate molecule in a process called phosphorylation The
phosphorylation of a substrate molecule changes its structural orientation thereby activating it These activated
molecules can then mediate changes in cellular processes
The effect of a hormone is amplified as the signaling pathway progresses The binding of a hormone at a single
receptor causes the activation of many Gproteins which activates adenylyl cyclase Each molecule of adenylyl
cyclase then triggers the formation of many molecules of cAMP Further amplification occurs as protein kinases
once activated by cAMP can catalyze many reactions In this way a small amount of hormone can trigger the
formation of a large amount of cellular product To stop hormone activity cAMP is deactivated by the cytoplasmic
enzyme phosphodiesterase or PDE PDE is always present in the cell and breaks down cAMP to control
hormone activity preventing overproduction of cellular products
The specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present
on the cell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm Cellular responses to hormone
binding of a receptor include altering membrane permeability and metabolic pathways stimulating synthesis of
proteins and enzymes and activating hormone release
