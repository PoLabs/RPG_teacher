As animals became more complex specific organs and organ systems developed to support specific functions
for the organism The reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate
fertilize internally and support the growth and development of offspring
Human Reproductive Anatomy
The reproductive tissues of male and female humans develop similarly in utero until a low level of the hormone
testosterone is released from male gonads Testosterone causes the undeveloped tissues to differentiate into
male sexual organs When testosterone is absent the tissues develop into female sexual tissues Primitive
gonads become testes or ovaries Tissues that produce a penis in males produce a clitoris in females The tissue
that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a female that is they are homologous structures
Male Reproductive Anatomy
In the male reproductive system the scrotum houses the testicles or testes singular testis including providing
passage for blood vessels nerves and muscles related to testicular function The testes are a pair of male
reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones Each testis is approximately 25 by
38 cm 15 by 1 in in size and divided into wedgeshaped lobules by connective tissue called septa Coiled in
each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce sperm
Sperm are immobile at body temperature therefore the scrotum and penis are external to the body as illustrated
in Figure 438 so that a proper temperature is maintained for motility In land mammals the pair of testes must be
suspended outside the body at about 2 C lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm Infertility can
occur in land mammals when the testes do not descend through the abdominal cavity during fetal development
Figure 438 The reproductive structures of the human male are shown
Which of the following statements about the male reproductive system is false
a
The vas deferens carries sperm from the testes to the penis
b
Sperm mature in seminiferous tubules in the testes
c
Both the prostate and the bulbourethral glands produce components of the semen
d
The prostate gland is located in the testes
Sperm mature in seminiferous tubules that are coiled inside the testes as illustrated in Figure 438 The walls
of the seminiferous tubules are made up of the developing sperm cells with the least developed sperm at the
periphery of the tubule and the fully developed sperm in the lumen The sperm cells are mixed with nursemaid
cells called Sertoli cells which protect the germ cells and promote their development Other cells mixed in the
wall of the tubules are the interstitial cells of Leydig These cells produce high levels of testosterone once the
male reaches adolescence
