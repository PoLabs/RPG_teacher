struggle in which the cutlass was torn from the pirates grasp He
wriggled overboard and John leapt after him The dinghy drifted
away
Here and there a head bobbed up in the water and there was a
flash of steel followed by a cry or a whoop In the confusion some
struck at their own side The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the
fourth rib but he was himself pinked in turn by Curly Farther from
the rock Starkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard
Where all this time was Peter He was seeking bigger game
The others were all brave boys and they must not be blamed for
backing from the pirate captain His iron claw made a circle of dead
water round him from which they fled like affrighted fishes
But there was one who did not fear him there was one prepared to
enter that circle
Strangely it was not in the water that they met Hook rose to the
rock to breathe and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the
opposite side The rock was slippery as a ball and they had to crawl
rather than climb Neither knew that the other was coming Each
feeling for a grip met the others arm in surprise they raised their
heads their faces were almost touching so they met
Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they
fell to they had a sinking Had it been so with Peter at that moment I
would admit it After all he was the only man that the SeaCook had
feared But Peter had no sinking he had one feeling only gladness
and he gnashed his pretty teeth with joy Quick as thought he
snatched a knife from Hooks belt and was about to drive it home
when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe It would not
have been fighting fair He gave the pirate a hand to help him up
It was then that Hook bit him
Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter It
made him quite helpless He could only stare horrified Every child
is affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly All he thinks he
has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness After you
have been unfair to him he will love you again but will never
afterwards be quite the same boy No one ever gets over the first
unfairness no one except Peter He often met it but he always forgot
it I suppose that was the real difference between him and all the rest
So when he met it now it was like the first time and he could just
stare helpless Twice the iron hand clawed him
A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water
striking wildly for the ship no elation on the pestilent face now only
white fear for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him On
ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering
but now they were uneasy for they had lost both Peter and Wendy
and were scouring the lagoon for them calling them by name They
found the dinghy and went home in it shouting Peter Wendy as
they went but no answer came save mocking laughter from the
mermaids They must be swimming back or flying the boys
concluded They were not very anxious because they had such faith
in Peter They chuckled boylike because they would be late for bed
and it was all mother Wendys fault
