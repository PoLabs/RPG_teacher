ANALYSING
211 INTRODUCTION
Lets look at a realworld example to help explain what conversion optimisation is Think of a 
shoe store When laying out the store a lot of care is taken to determine where to place displays 
mirrors chairs and the checkout counters However there is no way of easily determining if 
the current layout is the best option 
For example the checkout counter may be at the front of the store It may however be worth 
testing to see if moving it to the middle of the store affects sales This would require tracking 
sales over a period of time with the checkout counters in the front of the storethen shutting 
down for a few days while the store is reorganised and tracking sales with the new layout 
But this is all a little impractical 
In contrast if you have an online store you can just show slightly or very different versions of 
web pages to visitors and track how different versions affect sales You would not need to shut 
down your website to create new versions and you can watch results emerge in real time as 
hundreds of customers pass through the store The cycle of tweaking and testing websites 
in this way is called conversion optimisation This chapter will take you through the steps in 
a conversion optimisation processhelping you understand how to make things work better
