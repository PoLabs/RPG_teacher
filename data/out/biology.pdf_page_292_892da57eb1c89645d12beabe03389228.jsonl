In the third level of compaction a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin These fibrous
proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a nondividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that
does not overlap with that of any other chromosome see the top image in Figure 103
Figure 104 Doublestranded DNA wraps around histone proteins to form nucleosomes that create the appearance
of beads on a string The nucleosomes are coiled into a 30nm chromatin fiber When a cell undergoes mitosis the
chromosomes condense even further
DNA replicates in the S phase of interphase which technically is not a part of mitosis but must always precede it
After replication the chromosomes are composed of two linked sister chromatids When fully compact the pairs
of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins The connection between the
sister chromatids is closest in a region called the centromere The conjoined sister chromatids with a diameter
of about 1 m are visible under a light microscope The centromeric region is highly condensed and thus will
appear as a constricted area
This animation illustrates the different levels of chromosome packing
