limelight during the Covid19 pandemic not only regarding vaccines but also 
concerning simple technologies such as facemasks
Conclusion 
The sciences as a stronghold of rationality became disputed in the twentieth 
century by means of their inextricable involvement with aggression towards 
and domination of humankind and nature What is more reflections on the 
natural sciences not least in the humanities psychology or the social sciences 
have questioned their optimistic pursuit of models of linear progress
increasingly so in the last third of the century In light of the challenges of the 
twentyfirst century such as climate change and rising authoritarianism it 
may seem that the tide has changed once more with the sciences again finding 
frequent association with the cause of democracy and progress Regarding 
the development of technology some authors describe the second half of the 
twentieth century as the period of Americanisationa process during which 
Europeans embraced and internalised the principles of a consumer society 
Technological gadgets such as fancy cars refrigerators portable radios 
colour television or more recently mobile phones all contributed significantly 
to that process Living in an affluent society built on the constant production 
of new innovations provided by technoscientific research Europeans were 
slow to realise and admit to the harmful effects of the global extension of 
their supply networks Enjoying the fruits of technological progress their 
longing for new and better instruments and things helped to spin the wheels 
of global capitalism and significantly contributed to anthropogenic changes 
in the environment with potentially hazardous effects on the entire planet 
Now somewhat paradoxically they are again invoking the capacity of state
organised science and technology to confront global threats and challenges 
by redirecting the aims of technological politics from provision of welfare 
towards sustainability and environmental protection
