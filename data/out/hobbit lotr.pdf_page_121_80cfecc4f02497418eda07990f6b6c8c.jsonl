into the lowest branches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path
and up he had to go as best he could He pushed his way through the tangled
twigs with many a slap in the eye he was greened and grimed from the old bark
of the greater boughs more than once he slipped and caught himself just in time
and at last after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place where there seemed to be
no convenient branches at all he got near the top All the time he was wondering
whether there were spiders in the tree and how he was going to get down again
except by falling
In the end he poked his head above the roof of leaves and then he found
spiders all right But they were only small ones of ordinary size and they were
after the butterflies Bilbos eyes were nearly blinded by the light He could hear
the dwarves shouting up at him from far below but he could not answer only
hold on and blink The sun was shining brilliantly and it was a long while before
he could bear it When he could he saw all round him a sea of dark green

if Bilbo had had the sense to see it the tree that he had climbed though it was
tall in itself was standing near the bottom of a wide valley so that from its top
the trees seemed to swell up all round like the edges of a great bowl and he
could not expect to see how far the forest lasted Still he did not see this and he
climbed down full of despair He got to the bottom again at last scratched hot
and miserable and he could not see anything in the gloom below when he got
there His report soon made the others as miserable as he was
The forest goes on for ever and ever and ever in all directions Whatever
shall we do And what is the use of sending a hobbit they cried as if it was his

angry when he told them of the beautiful breeze which they were too heavy to
