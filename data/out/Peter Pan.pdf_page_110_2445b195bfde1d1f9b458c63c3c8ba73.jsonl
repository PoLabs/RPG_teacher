Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can
be freely distributed in machinereadable form accessible by the
widest array of equipment including outdated equipment Many
small donations 1 to 5000 are particularly important to
maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and
keep up with these requirements We do not solicit donations in
locations where we have not received written confirmation of
compliance To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of
compliance for any particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where
we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no
prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in
such states who approach us with offers to donate
International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
