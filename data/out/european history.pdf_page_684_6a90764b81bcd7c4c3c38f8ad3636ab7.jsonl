relationship is known as subjectionmeaning the legal status of domination 
of landlords over the resident population This status was primarily connected 
to landownership but it could also extend to the administration of justice by 
the landlord and in its most hierarchical expressions included control over 
subjects marital states succession duties as well as mobility restrictions
While tenurial relations and subjection characterised all of Europe serfdom 
had a much more limited geographical extent Under serfdom the landowner 
concentrated in their hands powers of land tenure the administration of 
justice and personal bondage Unlike tenurial relations or subjection the 
landlord enjoyed much greater discretion over the resident serfs including 
the specific right to acquire sell andor transfer serfs from one property title to 
another Serfdom as a social system evolved most fully in parts of Schleswig
Holstein Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania in the Baltics presentday 
Estonia Latvia and Lithuania Russia Moldavia and Wallachia as well as
to a lesser degreein parts of Hungary and Transylvania The central element 
of serfdom was economic codependency which meant that both lords and 
serfs enjoyed rights and mutual obligations such as the landlords duty to 
help their serfs in times of hardship famine disease and war in exchange for 
the serfs labour duties Because serfdom resurfaced in these regions after a 
period of relative decline in the late Middle Ages scholarship also refers to 
these phenomena as refeudalisation or the second serfdom
Another distinction which emerged over the course of the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries between tenurial relations subjection and serfdom 
derives from the fact that in some regions there also existed forms of hereditary 
subjection meaning that the landlords power automatically extended over 
the tenants children While this practice existed all across Europe additional 
burdens deriving from it were greater in EastCentral Europe especially in 
terms of forced labour rents corve or robotarobot
Apart from the changing normative frameworks that governed these 
relationships the practices of subjection and serfdom in particular varied 
greatly across time and space There exists no single legislative or executive 
act that unambiguously and unchangingly established either as a system in 
any area Conditions and relations between property owners and the resident 
population changed gradually if in a nonlinear fashion and the characteristics 
of these mutual ties were continually changing as well
Seigneurial interference with the tenants freedom of mobility the 
administration of justice property rights and forced labour rents manifested 
themselves differently across early modern Europe During the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries tighter control was imposed over the landlords own
