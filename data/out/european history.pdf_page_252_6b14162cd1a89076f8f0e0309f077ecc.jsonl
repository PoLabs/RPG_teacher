During the Middle Ages and up to at least 1300 individuals were conceived 
as insufficient incomplete or imperfect and intermediate communities were 
instead seen as essential to protect and fulfil those individuals Premodern 
Europe was according to historian Paolo Grossi a society made of societies 
Around 1500 European societies were still notably fragmented The world was 
to a large extent composed of families and guilds while religious confessional 
identities also played a key role Individuals belonged to different estates and 
corporations and it was belonging to those groups which granted privileges 
and created obligations Inequality between the privileged and the non
privileged was not only acknowledged but an integral part of the system The 
social order was consistently conceived as hierarchical and verticalrulers 
placed above the ruledwhile images of horizontality or equality were 
uncommon Inequality therefore lay at the very core of the political and social 
order of ancien rgime Europe
Several elements contributed to dissolving and changing some of the 
fundamentals of what historians have designated as a society of orders or 
of estates First shifts in the anthropological conception of the individual 
stressed the centrality of human agency Examples of this are a renewed 
attention to civic participation and attention to the differences between 
human groups around the world since at least 1400 Second during the 
seventeenth century natural law theories known also by the Latin term 
iusnaturalismus developed These theories conceived the origins of society 
by imagining an initial moment in which individuals acted or lived alone 
This speculative moment sometimes called a state of nature was crucial to 
considering individuals as equals bearers of rights and the main agents of 
historywho after the original moment transferred their rights and power to 
a sovereign Third violent political conflicts also contributed to discussions of 
the established order and its very foundations A case in point is seventeenth
century England where political and military unrest and a strong parliament 
led to parallel developments in the ideas of political participation alongside 
the protection of a space of liberty inherent to the subjects Finally the 
eighteenth century saw rapid increases in literacy rates in western European 
urban centres with changing social conditions increased urbanisation and the 
growth of manufacturing prominent among them leading many to question 
the traditional basis of hierarchy This phenomenon was captured in growing 
discussions about the legitimacy of inequality The end of the eighteenth 
century was marked by revolutions whose aims included a complete alteration 
of previous notions of inequality and the development of procedures to cope 
with inequality
It was precisely a controversy over how to cope with inequality that 
helped precipitate the French Revolution of 1789 The nearbankruptcy of the
