The Late Twentieth Century and Steps towards a United 
Europe
Since the end of the nineteenth century many European universities took on 
increasing numbers of students This was a trend that accelerated in Western 
Europe after the end of First World War eventually leading to a fundamental 
transformation of its universities from the 1960s onwards Previously 
universities had usually addressed only a small minority of a population 
making them something of an elite institution As student numbers grew they 
transformed into mass institutions Although the student body has been further 
growing from the 1960s onwards the financial resources in the education sector 
have increased only slightly or remained unchanged in proportion to rising 
student numbers This has led to generally poorer educational conditions 
and growing dissatisfaction among the increasingly diverse composition of 
the student and teaching body The massification of higher education and 
its consequences were some of many forces that drove protests around the 
year of 1968 which led to demands for the democratisation of society in 
general and the educational system in particular However proposals for 
a group university in Western European countries such as Germany and 
the Netherlands which would correspond rights to defined status groups 
students academic staff nonacademic staff and professors were usually 
rejected after a few years The massification of the educational sector was also 
countered by educational offerings via new technologies Distance learning 
and online universities as well as video platforms produced new forms of 
knowledge transfer The nationstate framework for science culture and 
education was thus transformed by alternative forms of knowledge transfer 
that were virtually independent of statehood
The development of industrial research from the 1960s onwards is in fact 
part of much longer processes on the scale of the long twentieth century In 
Germany the creation of the PhysikalischTechnische Reichstanstalt in 1887 
was inspired by the German electrical industry which expressed a growing 
need for precise measuring instruments This institutional innovation was 
notably imitated in Great Britain with the National Physical Laboratory 
1900 and in France with the establishment of a testing laboratory at the 
Conservatoire national des arts et mtiers 1901 At the same time the first 
inhouse research structures were developed in Europe in large companies 
The period leading up to the First World War and the conflict itself expedited
