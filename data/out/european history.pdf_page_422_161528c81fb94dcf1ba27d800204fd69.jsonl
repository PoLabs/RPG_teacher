and Europe political and social revolutions broke out in the United States 
of America 17761783 Geneva 1785 the Netherlands 17851786 France 
summer of 1789 and the Austrian Netherlands October 1789 But if newer 
generations of historians have accepted the importance of the circulation of 
ideas and models of struggle between these revolutions attention to the distinct 
features of each revolution means that the concept of an Atlantic Revolution is 
no longer fashionable 
For the French Revolution certainly the most radical three revolutionary 
stages can be distinguished in May and June 1789 a revolution led by the 
social elites during the Estates General tats gnraux at Versailles from mid
June to midJuly the revolution of urban citizens in Paris the storming of the 
Bastille and subsequently other towns and cities from midJuly the Great 
Fear Grande Peur in the countryside an antifeudal uprising These distinct 
but partly overlapping popular dynamics forced the deputies to declare an 
end to the ancien rgime on 4 August 1789 As a result the manorial system 
was partially abolished and in 17901791 the National Constituent Assembly 
Assemble nationale constituante established a liberal economic order the guilds

These policies changed the nature of popular protests once again eight 
rural uprisings from 1790 to 1792 appeared to fight the liberal order as well as 
the leftovers of the manorial system In the cities social protest transformed 
into a political movement the sansculottes The sansculottes sought to create 
a society of independent producers in a regulated economic system On 11 
August 1792 the day after the fall of the monarchy the manorial regime was 
finally abolished In June 1793 Robespierre and the Montagnards took power 
introduced a cap on prices and wages as the sansculottes had demanded and 
the adoption of measures to help the poorest peasantry though without land 
sharing The Directoire regime 17951799 restored the liberal economic order 
from which the urban people suffered more than their rural counterparts 
The regime quelled the popular urban riots the Conspiracy of Equals led 
by Gracchus Babeuf in May 1796 but also confirmed the definitive end of 
the manorial system in the countryside These principles were extended to 
the annexed European territories Belgium the Netherlands Northern Italy 
Switzerland and the left bank of the Rhine Napoleon would pursue this 
policy from 1800 to 1815 in Central and Eastern European in particular by 
abolishing serfdom

routinely involved in politics Without voting rights and often also without
