A Case of Identity
afterwards they remembered us and sent them to
mother Mr Windibank did not wish us to go He
never did wish us to go anywhere He would get
quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday
school treat But this time I was set on going and
I would go for what right had he to prevent He
said the folk were not t for us to know when all
fathers friends were to be there And he said that I
had nothing t to wear when I had my purple plush
that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer
At last when nothing else would do he went off to
France upon the business of the rm but we went
mother and I with Mr Hardy who used to be our
foreman and it was there I met Mr Hosmer Angel
I suppose said Holmes
that when Mr
Windibank came back from France he was very an
noyed at your having gone to the ball
Oh well he was very good about it He laughed
I remember and shrugged his shoulders and said
there was no use denying anything to a woman for
she would have her way
I see Then at the gastters ball you met as I
understand a gentleman called Mr Hosmer Angel
Yes sir I met him that night and he called next
day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that
we met himthat is to say Mr Holmes I met him
twice for walks but after that father came back again
and Mr Hosmer Angel could not come to the house
any more
No
Well you know father didnt like anything of the
sort He wouldnt have any visitors if he could help
it and he used to say that a woman should be happy
in her own family circle But then as I used to say to
mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with
and I had not got mine yet
But how about Mr Hosmer Angel Did he make
no attempt to see you
Well father was going off to France again in a
week and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be
safer and better not to see each other until he had
gone We could write in the meantime and he used
to write every day I took the letters in in the morning
so there was no need for father to know
Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time
Oh yes Mr Holmes We were engaged after the
rst walk that we took HosmerMr Angelwas a
cashier in an ofce in Leadenhall Streetand
What ofce
Thats the worst of it Mr Holmes I dont know
Where did he live then
He slept on the premises
And you dont know his address
Noexcept that it was Leadenhall Street
Where did you address your letters then
To the Leadenhall Street Post Ofce to be left till
called for He said that if they were sent to the ofce
he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about hav
ing letters from a lady so I offered to typewrite them
like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said
that when I wrote them they seemed to come from
me but when they were typewritten he always felt
that the machine had come between us That will just
show you how fond he was of me Mr Holmes and
the little things that he would think of
It was most suggestive said Holmes It has
long been an axiom of mine that the little things are
innitely the most important Can you remember any
other little things about Mr Hosmer Angel
He was a very shy man Mr Holmes He would
rather walk with me in the evening than in the day
light for he said that he hated to be conspicuous Very
retiring and gentlemanly he was Even his voice was
gentle Hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when
he was young he told me and it had left him with a
weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of
speech He was always well dressed very neat and
plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and
he wore tinted glasses against the glare
Well and what happened when Mr Windibank
your stepfather returned to France
Mr Hosmer Angel came to the house again and
proposed that we should marry before father came
back He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear
with my hands on the Testament that whatever hap
pened I would always be true to him Mother said
he was quite right to make me swear and that it was
a sign of his passion Mother was all in his favour
from the rst and was even fonder of him than I was
Then when they talked of marrying within the week
I began to ask about father but they both said never
to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards
and mother said she would make it all right with him
I didnt quite like that Mr Holmes It seemed funny
that I should ask his leave as he was only a few years
older than me but I didnt want to do anything on
the sly so I wrote to father at Bordeaux where the
company has its French ofces but the letter came
back to me on the very morning of the wedding
It missed him then
