diameter which prevents the plant from crosspollinating with a different species Figure 1820
Figure 1820 Some flowers have evolved to attract certain pollinators The a wide foxglove flower is adapted for
pollination by bees while the b long tubeshaped trumpet creeper flower is adapted for pollination by hummingbirds
When fertilization takes place and a zygote forms postzygotic barriers can prevent reproduction Hybrid
individuals in many cases cannot form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic
stages We call this hybrid inviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable In another
postzygotic situation reproduction leads to hybrid birth and growth that is sterile Therefore the organisms are
unable to reproduce offspring of their own We call this hybrid sterility
Habitat Influence on Speciation
Sympatric speciation may also take place in ways other than polyploidy For example consider a fish species
that lives in a lake As the population grows competition for food increases Under pressure to find food suppose
that a group of these fish had the genetic flexibility to discover and feed off another resource that other fish did
not use What if this new food source was located at a different depth of the lake Over time those feeding
on the second food source would interact more with each other than the other fish therefore they would breed
together as well Offspring of these fish would likely behave as their parents feeding and living in the same area
and keeping separate from the original population If this group of fish continued to remain separate from the
first population eventually sympatric speciation might occur as more genetic differences accumulated between
them
This scenario does play out in nature as do others that lead to reproductive isolation One such place is
Lake Victoria in Africa famous for its sympatric speciation of cichlid fish Researchers have found hundreds of
sympatric speciation events in these fish which have not only happened in great number but also over a short
period of time Figure 1821 shows this type of speciation among a cichlid fish population in Nicaragua In this
locale two types of cichlids live in the same geographic location but have come to have different morphologies
that allow them to eat various food sources
Figure 1821 Cichlid fish from Lake Apoyeque Nicaragua show evidence of sympatric speciation Lake Apoyeque
a crater lake is 1800 years old but genetic evidence indicates that a single population of cichlid fish populated the
lake only 100 years ago Nevertheless two populations with distinct morphologies and diets now exist in the lake and
scientists believe these populations may be in an early stage of speciation
