placental mammals
Characteristics of Mammals
The presence of hair composed of the protein keratin is one of the most obvious characteristics of mammals
Although it is not very extensive or obvious on some species such as whales hair has many important
functions for most mammals Mammals are endothermic and hair traps a boundary layer of air close to the body
retaining heat generated by metabolic activity Along with insulation hair can serve as a sensory mechanism via
specialized hairs called vibrissae better known as whiskers Vibrissae attach to nerves that transmit information
about tactile vibration produced by sound sensation which is particularly useful to nocturnal or burrowing
mammals Hair can also provide protective coloration or be part of social signaling such as when an animals
hair stands on end to warn enemies or possibly to make the mammal look bigger to predators
Unlike the skin of birds the integument skin of mammals includes a number of different types of secretory
glands Sebaceous glands produce a lipid mixture called sebum that is secreted onto the hair and skin
providing water resistance and lubrication for hair Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body Eccrine
glands produce sweat or perspiration which is mainly composed of water but also contains metabolic waste
products and sometimes compounds with antibiotic activity In most mammals eccrine glands are limited to
certain areas of the body and some mammals do not possess them at all However in primates especially
humans sweat glands are located over most of the body surface and figure prominently in regulating the body
temperature through evaporative cooling Apocrine glands or scent glands secrete substances that are used
for chemical communication such as in skunks Mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns
In both monotremes and eutherians both males and females possess mammary glands while in marsupials
mammary glands have been found only in some opossums Mammary glands likely are modified sebaceous or
eccrine glands but their evolutionary origin is not entirely clear
The skeletal system of mammals possesses many unique features The lower jaw of mammals consists of only
one bone the dentary and the jaw hinge connects the dentary to the squamosal flat part of the temporal
bone in the skull The jaws of other vertebrates are composed of several bones including the quadrate bone
at the back of the skull and the articular bone at the back of the jaw with the jaw connected between the
quadrate and articular bones In the ear of other vertebrates vibrations are transmitted to the inner ear by a
single bone the stapes In mammals the quadrate and articular bones have moved into the middle ear Figure
2937 The malleus is derived from the articular bone whereas the incus originated from the quadrate bone
This arrangement of jaw and ear bones aids in distinguishing fossil mammals from fossils of other synapsids
Figure 2937 Mammalian ear bones Bones of the mammalian middle ear are modified from bones of the jaw and skull
in reptiles The stapes is found in other vertebrates eg the columella of birds whereas in mammals the malleus and
incus are derived from the articular and quadrate bones respectively credit NCI
The adductor muscles that close the jaw comprise two major muscles in mammals the temporalis and the
masseter Working together these muscles permit upanddown and sidetoside movements of the jaw making
chewing possiblewhich is unique to mammals Most mammals have heterodont teeth meaning that they have
different types and shapes of teeth incisors canines premolars and molars rather than just one type and
shape of tooth Most mammals are also diphyodonts meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime
deciduous or baby teeth and permanent teeth Most other vertebrates with teeth are polyphyodonts that is
