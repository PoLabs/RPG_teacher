of the era of early industrialisation in European memoryperhaps assisted by 
the portrayals of socially sensitive novelists such as Charles Dickens Reality 
often lined up closely with this image For instance in Bohemia one of the first 
industrialised regions of EastCentral Europe the financial and political elites 
in 1800 mostly nobility and in 1900 mostly nobilitated businessmen consisted 
of less than one percent of the population both at the beginning and at the 
end of the century and their numbers could be counted in thousands By 1869 
there were more than 35 million poorie mostly unpropertied workers 
which gradually concentrated in industrial centres during the intensive 
industrialisation in the last quarter of the nineteenth century
Paradoxically and in contrast to much of the continent in Britain the trend 
in income inequality started to reverse at the time of the publication of The 
Communist Manifesto 1848 According to most economic historians in the 
second half of the century investments and growing consumption on the part 
of the wealthier social strata created new job opportunities and wage rates 
started to grow Together with social reforms this process to a certain extent 
curtailed the furthering of the distance between different social classes and 
mitigated the class war envisioned by Marx In Bohemia and other parts of the 
continent wages started to grow approximately thirty years later
The changes in the spatial distribution of wealth have generally followed 
the pattern associated with the expansion of international trade dividing 
the continent into centres and peripheries In the early nineteenth century 
economic growth in the core areas of industrialisation in the North Sea region 
greatly exceeded that of the rest of Europe although some areas such as 
Germany matched it in the periods before the First World War However 
even within individual states there was internal differentiation and income 
gaps opened between town and country but also between emerging 
industrial and rural regions depending on their success in the process of 
industrialisation However some authors in contrast to the traditional view 
that industrialisation triggered regional differentiation in the initial phase 
only to balance out again later ie that the inequality developed similarly in 
the horizontal spatial plane as in the vertical social plane now argue that
for examplethe differences between North and South in Italy and Spain 
or West and East in the Habsburg Empire may well simply reflect links and 
structures that existed already back in the eighteenth century The envisioned 
closing of regional income disparities in later phases of industrialisation after 
1900 does not hold up on closer inspection and regional differences prevail
Responses to Inequality
Growing inequality evoked different responses in practice in the nineteenth 
century The mass emigration from Europe to North America especially the
