Blood Types Related to Proteins on the Surface of the Red Blood
Cells
Red blood cells are coated in antigens made of glycolipids and glycoproteins The composition of these
molecules is determined by genetics which have evolved over time In humans the different surface
antigens are grouped into 24 different blood groups with more than 100 different antigens on each red
blood cell The two most well known blood groups are the ABO shown in Figure 409 and Rh systems
The surface antigens in the ABO blood group are glycolipids called antigen A and antigen B People with
blood type A have antigen A those with blood type B have antigen B those with blood type AB have both
antigens and people with blood type O have neither antigen Antibodies called agglutinougens are found in
the blood plasma and react with the A or B antigens if the two are mixed When type A and type B blood are
combined agglutination clumping of the blood occurs because of antibodies in the plasma that bind with
the opposing antigen this causes clots that coagulate in the kidney causing kidney failure Type O blood
has neither A or B antigens and therefore type O blood can be given to all blood types Type O negative
blood is the universal donor Type AB positive blood is the universal acceptor because it has both A and B
antigen The ABO blood groups were discovered in 1900 and 1901 by Karl Landsteiner at the University of
Vienna
The Rh blood group was first discovered in Rhesus monkeys Most people have the Rh antigen Rh and
do not have antiRh antibodies in their blood The few people who do not have the Rh antigen and are
Rh can develop antiRh antibodies if exposed to Rh blood This can happen after a blood transfusion
or after an Rh woman has an Rh baby The first exposure does not usually cause a reaction however
at the second exposure enough antibodies have built up in the blood to produce a reaction that causes
agglutination and breakdown of red blood cells An injection can prevent this reaction
Figure 409 Human red blood cells may have either type A or B glycoproteins on their surface both glycoproteins
combined AB or neither O The glycoproteins serve as antigens and can elicit an immune response in a person
who receives a transfusion containing unfamiliar antigens Type O blood which has no A or B antigens does not
elicit an immune response when injected into a person of any blood type Thus O is considered the universal
donor Persons with type AB blood can accept blood from any blood type and type AB is considered the universal
acceptor
