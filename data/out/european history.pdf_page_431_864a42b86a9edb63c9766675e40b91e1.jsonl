which claimed twentyone British nine Frenchmen ten Germans six Italians 
two Poles and two Swiss in its committee Numerous sections of the First 
International then developed in Belgium France Italy and Germany and later 
in the Netherlands Denmark Switzerland and Austria With several hundred 
thousand members the International was run by a General Council based in 
London and convened annual congresses It was represented in each country
