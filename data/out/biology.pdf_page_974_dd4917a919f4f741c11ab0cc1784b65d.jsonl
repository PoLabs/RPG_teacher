Figure 3113 The dodder is a holoparasite that penetrates the hosts vascular tissue and diverts nutrients for its own
growth Note that the vines of the dodder which has white flowers are beige The dodder has no chlorophyll and
cannot produce its own food credit LalithambaFlickr
Saprophytes
A saprophyte is a plant that does not have chlorophyll and gets its food from dead matter similar to bacteria and
fungi note that fungi are often called saprophytes which is incorrect because fungi are not plants Plants like
these use enzymes to convert organic food materials into simpler forms from which they can absorb nutrients
Figure 3114 Most saprophytes do not directly digest dead matter instead they parasitize fungi that digest
dead matter or are mycorrhizal ultimately obtaining photosynthate from a fungus that derived photosynthate
from its host Saprophytic plants are uncommon only a few species are described

do not have chlorophyll credit modification of work by Iwona ErskineKellie
Symbionts
A symbiont is a plant in a symbiotic relationship with special adaptations such as mycorrhizae or nodule
formation Fungi also form symbiotic associations with cyanobacteria and green algae called lichens Lichens
can sometimes be seen as colorful growths on the surface of rocks and trees Figure 3115 The algal partner
phycobiont makes food autotrophically some of which it shares with the fungus the fungal partner mycobiont
absorbs water and minerals from the environment which are made available to the green alga If one partner
was separated from the other they would both die
