very much a product of modernity themselves the ideologically committed 
avantgardists positioned themselves as harbingers of the destruction of 
traditional experience Faced with radical social and political transformations 
new modes of industrial production and rationalisation and a growing sense 
of psychosocial and intellectualspiritual alienation from the modern world 
during the first half of the twentieth century the avantgardists explored new 
avenues in seeking to create out of revolutionary activism and an experiential 
tabula rasa a new art In so doing they opposed tradition with creative 
freedom which wasto themthe only way to project the new life they
