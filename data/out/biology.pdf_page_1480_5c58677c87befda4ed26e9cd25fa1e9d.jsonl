which states that whenever energy is converted from one form to another there is a tendency toward disorder
entropy in the system In biologic systems this energy takes the form of metabolic heat which is lost when
the organisms consume other organisms In the Silver Springs ecosystem example Figure 468 we see that
the primary consumers produced 1103 kcalm2yr from the 7618 kcalm2yr of energy available to them from
the primary producers The measurement of energy transfer efficiency between two successive trophic levels is
termed the trophic level transfer efficiency TLTE and is defined by the formula
TLTE   production at present trophic level
production at previous trophic level  100
In Silver Springs the TLTE between the first two trophic levels was approximately 148 percent The low
efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels is usually the major factor that limits the length of food chains
observed in a food web The fact is after four to six energy transfers there is not enough energy left to support
another trophic level In the Lake Ontario example shown in Figure 466 only three energy transfers occurred
between the primary producer green algae and the apex consumer Chinook salmon
Ecologists have many different methods of measuring energy transfers within ecosystems Measurement
difficulty depends on the complexity of the ecosystem and how much access scientists have to observe the
ecosystem In other words some ecosystems are more difficult to study than others and sometimes the
quantification of energy transfers has to be estimated
Other parameters are important in characterizing energy flow within an ecosystem Net production efficiency
NPE allows ecologists to quantify how efficiently organisms of a particular trophic level incorporate the energy
they receive into biomass it is calculated using the following formula
NPE   net consumer productivity
assimilation
  100
Net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level
Assimilation is the biomass energy content generated per unit area of the present trophic level after
accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food energy used for respiration and energy lost
as waste Incomplete ingestion refers to the fact that some consumers eat only a part of their food For example
when a lion kills an antelope it will eat everything except the hide and bones The lion is missing the energyrich
bone marrow inside the bone so the lion does not make use of all the calories its prey could provide
Thus NPE measures how efficiently each trophic level uses and incorporates the energy from its food into
biomass to fuel the next trophic level In general coldblooded animals ectotherms such as invertebrates fish
amphibians and reptiles use less of the energy they obtain for respiration and heat than warmblooded animals
endotherms such as birds and mammals The extra heat generated in endotherms although an advantage
in terms of the activity of these organisms in colder environments is a major disadvantage in terms of NPE
Therefore many endotherms have to eat more often than ectotherms to get the energy they need for survival In
general NPE for ectotherms is an order of magnitude 10x higher than for endotherms For example the NPE
for a caterpillar eating leaves has been measured at 18 percent whereas the NPE for a squirrel eating acorns
may be as low as 16 percent
The inefficiency of energy use by warmblooded animals has broad implications for the worlds food supply It
is widely accepted that the meat industry uses large amounts of crops to feed livestock and because the NPE
is low much of the energy from animal feed is lost For example it costs about 001 to produce 1000 dietary
calories kcal of corn or soybeans but approximately 019 to produce a similar number of calories growing
cattle for beef consumption The same energy content of milk from cattle is also costly at approximately 016
per 1000 kcal Much of this difference is due to the low NPE of cattle Thus there has been a growing movement
worldwide to promote the consumption of nonmeat and nondairy foods so that less energy is wasted feeding
animals for the meat industry
Modeling Ecosystems Energy Flow Ecological Pyramids
The structure of ecosystems can be visualized with ecological pyramids which were first described by the
pioneering studies of Charles Elton in the 1920s Ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of various
parameters such as number of organisms energy and biomass across trophic levels
Pyramids of numbers can be either upright or inverted depending on the ecosystem As shown in Figure 4610
typical grassland during the summer has a base of many plants and the numbers of organisms decrease at
each trophic level However during the summer in a temperate forest the base of the pyramid consists of few
trees compared with the number of primary consumers mostly insects Because trees are large they have
