Plant Parasites and Pathogens
The production of sufficient highquality crops is essential to human existence Unfortunately plant diseases
have ruined many crops throughout human agricultural history sometimes creating widespread famine Many
plant pathogens are fungi that cause tissue decay and the eventual death of the host Figure 2426 In addition
to destroying plant tissue directly some plant pathogens spoil crops by producing potent toxins that can further
damage and kill the host plant Fungi are also responsible for food spoilage and the rotting of stored crops For
example the fungus Claviceps purpurea causes ergot a disease of cereal crops especially of rye Although
the fungus reduces the yield of cereals the effects of the ergots alkaloid toxins on humans and animals are
of much greater significance In animals the disease is referred to as ergotism The most common signs and
symptoms are convulsions hallucination gangrene and loss of milk in cattle The active ingredient of ergot
is lysergic acid which is a precursor of the drug LSD Smuts rusts and powdery or downy mildew are other
examples of common fungal pathogens that affect crops

that causes grey rot can destroy a grape crop However controlled infection of grapes by Botrytis results in noble rot

Aflatoxins are toxic carcinogenic compounds released by fungi of the genus Aspergillus Periodically harvests
of nuts and grains are tainted by aflatoxins leading to massive recall of produce This sometimes ruins producers
and causes food shortages in developing countries
Animal and Human Parasites and Pathogens
Fungi can affect animals including humans in several ways A mycosis is a fungal disease that results from
infection and direct damage due to the growth and infiltration of the fungus Fungi attack animals directly by
colonizing and destroying tissues Mycotoxicosis is the poisoning of humans and other animals by foods
contaminated by fungal toxins mycotoxins Mycetismus specifically describes the ingestion of preformed
toxins in poisonous mushrooms In addition individuals who display hypersensitivity to molds and spores may
