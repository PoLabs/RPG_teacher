UNIT 3 POWER AND CITIZENSHIP
336
Revolution saw the birth of ideologies as blueprints for the future of society it 
saw the birth of the nation the idea of a community with a common destiny 
and a common struggle and as a result of these new comprehensive and 
ambitious dimensions of political activity the French Revolution massively 
enhanced state power for example through the invention of mass conscription 
the leve en masse and a sense of the states entitlement to all sorts of action 
In short it brought about the modern state with its almost unbounded 
capabilities potentially benign but also potentially destructive
There is something else that the French Revolution bequeathed to the 
modern era the very idea of making a revolution So far revolutions were the 
unintended results of rebellions or else as in 1789 of derailed governmental 
attempts at reform After 1789 it became conceivable and in some quarters 
desirable to change a regime or a political system through concerted 
revolutionary action
More immediately too the French Revolution had massive repercussions 
Perhaps most conspicuously the revolution in Haiti 17911804 led to the 
abolition of slavery in all French colonies and to the first successful independence 
of a former European colony Within Europe conquests between 1794 and 1799 
by French revolutionary armiesof Belgium and the United Provinces of the 
left bank of the Rhine Switzerland and the Italian Peninsulaall led to the 
overthrow of monarchical regimes and to the creation of an alliance of Sister 
Republics around France The invaders could rely on the support of a minority 
of local revolutionaries active since the end of the 1780s who imitated many 
French inventionssuch as the Milanese revolutionaries who drafted the 
Italian tricolour flag in 1797 But local revolutionaries tended to be influenced 
less by the French model than by their own experiences referring also to the 
republican models of Roman antiquity the republicanism of Machiavelli and 
the reformism of the Italian in particular Tuscan Enlightenment In fact the 
constitutions of Sister Republics in Naples Genoa and Bologna drafted in 
1797 and 1798 were much more democratic and sociallyminded than the 
contemporaneous French one Constitution of the Year III1795 even though 
they drew on the French Jacobin Constitution of the Year II 1793 Like the 
French revolutionaries of Year II the Italian revolutionaries also aimed a 
national unitary republican and social state and are therefore labelled the 
Italian Jacobins
Conclusion
Clearly revolutions and civil wars in early modern Europe embedded in their 
own specific contexts were too divergent from each other to be subsumed in 
strong generalisations What can be said however is that dynastic and factional
