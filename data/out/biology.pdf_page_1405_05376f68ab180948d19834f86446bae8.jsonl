As the river or stream flows away from the source the width of the channel gradually widens and the current
slows This slowmoving water caused by the gradient decrease and the volume increase as tributaries unite
has more sedimentation Phytoplankton can also be suspended in slowmoving water Therefore the water will
not be as clear as it is near the source The water is also warmer Worms phylum Annelida and insects phylum
Arthropoda can be found burrowing into the mud The higher order predator vertebrates phylum Chordata
include waterfowl frogs and fishes These predators must find food in these slow moving sometimes murky
waters and unlike the trout in the waters at the source these vertebrates may not be able to use vision as their
primary sense to find food Instead they are more likely to use taste or chemical cues to find prey
Wetlands
Wetlands are environments in which the soil is either permanently or periodically saturated with water Wetlands
are different from lakes because wetlands are shallow bodies of water whereas lakes vary in depth Emergent
vegetation consists of wetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves stems and flowers
extending above the waters surface There are several types of wetlands including marshes swamps bogs
mudflats and salt marshes Figure 4425 The three shared characteristics among these typeswhat makes
them wetlandsare their hydrology hydrophytic vegetation and hydric soils

Freshwater marshes and swamps are characterized by slow and steady water flow Bogs however develop in
depressions where water flow is low or nonexistent Bogs usually occur in areas where there is a clay bottom
with poor percolation of water Percolation is the movement of water through the pores in the soil or rocks The
water found in a bog is stagnant and oxygendepleted because the oxygen used during the decomposition of
organic matter is not readily replaced As the oxygen in the water is depleted decomposition slows This leads
to a buildup of acids and a lower water pH The lower pH creates challenges for plants because it limits the
available nitrogen As a result some bog plants such as sundews pitcher plants and Venus flytraps capture
insects in order to extract the nitrogen from their bodies Bogs have low net primary productivity because the
water found in bogs has low levels of nitrogen and oxygen
445  Climate and the Effects of Global Climate
Change
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Define global climate change

Summarize the effects of the Industrial Revolution on global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration

Describe three natural factors affecting longterm global climate

List two or more greenhouse gases and describe their role in the greenhouse effect
All biomes are universally affected by global conditions such as climate that ultimately shape each biomes
