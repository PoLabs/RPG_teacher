CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
22 Describe one of the reasons why the garden pea
was an excellent choice of model system for studying
inheritance
23 How would you perform a reciprocal cross for the
characteristic of stem height in the garden pea
24 Mendel performs a cross using a truebreeding
pea plant with round yellow seeds and a true
breeding pea plant with green wrinkled seeds What
is the probability that offspring will have green round
seeds Calculate the probability for the F1 and F2
generations
25 Calculate the probability of selecting a heart or a
face card from a standard deck of cards Is this
outcome more or less likely than selecting a heart
suit face card
26 The gene for flower position in pea plants exists
as axial or terminal alleles Given that axial is
dominant to terminal list all of the possible F1 and F2
genotypes and phenotypes from a cross involving
parents that are homozygous for each trait Express
genotypes with conventional genetic abbreviations
27 Use a Punnett square to predict the offspring in a
cross between a dwarf pea plant homozygous
recessive and a tall pea plant heterozygous What
is the phenotypic ratio of the offspring
28 Can a human male be a carrier of redgreen color
blindness
29 Why is it more efficient to perform a test cross
with a homozygous recessive donor than a
homozygous dominant donor How could the same
information still be found with a homozygous
dominant donor
30 Use the probability method to calculate the
genotypes and genotypic proportions of a cross
between AABBCc and Aabbcc parents
31 Explain epistatis in terms of its Greeklanguage
roots standing upon
32 In Section 123 Laws of Inheritance an
example of epistasis was given for the summer
squash Cross white WwYy heterozygotes to prove
the phenotypic ratio of 12 white3 yellow1 green that
was given in the text
33 People with trisomy 21 develop Downs
syndrome What law of Mendelian inheritance is
violated in this disease What is the most likely way
this occurs
34 A heterozygous pea plant produces violet flowers
and yellow round seeds Describe the expected
genotypes of the gametes produced by Mendelian
inheritance If all three genes are found on the same
arm of one chromosome should a scientist predict
that inheritance patterns will follow Mendelian
genetics
