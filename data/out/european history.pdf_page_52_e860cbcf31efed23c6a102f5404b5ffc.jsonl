connotations In 1983 during the final phase of the Communist Bloc as its crisis 
became more and more evident a new interpretation of the idea of Central 
Europe was proposed by the Czech writer Milan Kundera In his article The 
Stolen West or the Tragedy of Central Europe Kundera argued that Eastern 
Europe should return to where according to him it had always beenthe 
West The Hungarianborn British historian Lszl Pter has argued that this 
idea of Eastern Europe as an integral part of the West mayat least partly
have been a misunderstanding Research shows that the accelerating relative 
deterioration of everyday living conditions in the 1980s was a central driver 
for change in Eastern Europe Joining the EC seemed to offer an alternative 
possibility which made Europe and European integration of the East an 
attractive goal for many social groups and organisations demanding change 
even if these groups neither shared nor were actually offered all of the ideals 
that Western Europe publicly attributed to its unionsuch as democracy a 
common culture economic unity and prosperity solidarity subsidiarity 
freedom of movement and rule of law Furthermore Western European 
governments had a broad agenda that went beyond these concerns While 
uniting the continent politically and creating a stronger economic union was a 
paramount goal there were also geostrategic and securityoriented reasons for 
integration such as limiting Russian influence 
Another important phenomenon of the postCold War period was the 
fact that the European idea promoted since the beginning of the twentieth 
century primarily by the continents elites became an important issue for 
European public discourse as shown by the debates on the Maastricht Treaty 
19921993 and the treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 20042005 
The European idea became an important subject of debate This debate often 
centred on a particular institutionalisation of the European idea which 
was often considered too bureaucratic and not democratic enough Much 
progress had been made in the fields of the Europeanisation of education 
free movement and even social benefitsthrough for example the Erasmus 
scheme for student mobility the Bologna Process and the introduction of the 
European healthcare card Still the idea of Europeor rather the EUalso 
became identified with overly bureaucratic institutions weak democratic 
participation and insufficient political representation for its citizens Recurring 
crises such as the global financial crisis of 2008 andmore importantlythe 
failure of the EU member states to adequately respond to them with one voice 
and in solidarity have aggravated preexisting antiEuropean sentiments across 
diverse social strata and political parties in Europe The current steep rise of 
antiEuropeanism is therefore one of the major challenges to the European 
idea at present
