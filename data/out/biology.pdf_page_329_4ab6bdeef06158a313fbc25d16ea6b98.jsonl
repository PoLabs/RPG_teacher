organism are the gametes Early in the development of the embryo specialized diploid cells called germ cells
are produced within the gonads such as the testes and ovaries Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate
the germ cell line and meiosis to produce haploid gametes Once the haploid gametes are formed they lose
the ability to divide again There is no multicellular haploid life stage Fertilization occurs with the fusion of two
gametes usually from different individuals restoring the diploid state Figure 118
Figure 118 In animals sexually reproducing adults form haploid gametes from diploid germ cells Fusion of the
gametes gives rise to a fertilized egg cell or zygote The zygote will undergo multiple rounds of mitosis to produce a
multicellular offspring The germ cells are generated early in the development of the zygote
Most fungi and algae employ a lifecycle type in which the body of the organismthe ecologically important
part of the life cycleis haploid The haploid cells that make up the tissues of the dominant multicellular stage
are formed by mitosis During sexual reproduction specialized haploid cells from two individualsdesignated
the  and  mating typesjoin to form a diploid zygote The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis to
form four haploid cells called spores Although these spores are haploid like the parents they contain a new
genetic combination from two parents The spores can remain dormant for various time periods Eventually
when conditions are favorable the spores form multicellular haploid structures through many rounds of mitosis
