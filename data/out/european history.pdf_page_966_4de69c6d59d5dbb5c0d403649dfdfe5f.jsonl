In Eastern Europe the official memory of victimhood held firmly until 1989 
Only then were some darker aspects uncovered such as collaboration with 
Nazi Germany or complicity in the Holocaust Illustrative are controversies 
surrounding Polish societys role in the Holocaust These were reawakened 
by the book Neighbors The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne 
Poland published in 2000 by PolishAmerican historian Jan T Gross which 
dealt with the massacre of Jews in the small town of Jedwabne in 1941 and 
the recent decision of the Polish legislature to criminalise any mentions of 
Polish concentration camps The latter case is just one of many examples 
of the regulation of memory by law a controversial but common practice in 
contemporary Europe The Ukrainian decommunisation laws adopted in 
2015 which banned the use of Nazi and Soviet symbolswhile also honouring

While facilitating memory debates on a truly European scale the fall of 
the Iron Curtain also revealed discrepancies between Western and Eastern 
dealings with the past both in content and in form The Holocaust became 
the cornerstone of the Western and globalised memory culture reaching the 
status of the utmost evil In contrast the crimes of Stalinism were compared 
with other atrocities in European history Moreover different parts of Europe 
have their own particular traumas and memory issues While the legacy of 
socialism remains an important issue in many Eastern European countries the 
legacy of colonialism has haunted many Western European societies Coming 
to terms with the latter has caused more than public debates about how to 
tackle the colonial past in museums or schools Recently this process also 
included the pulling down of statues of many historical figures who embody 
or symbolise colonial oppression a movement that was much less popular 
in the postsocialist countries who were reluctant to share selfcriticism for
