Figure 4412 Each of the worlds major biomes is distinguished by characteristic temperatures and amounts of
precipitation Polar ice and mountains are also shown
Which of the following statements about biomes is false
a
Chaparral is dominated by shrubs
b
Savannas and temperate grasslands are dominated by grasses
c
Boreal forests are dominated by deciduous trees
d
Lichens are common in the arctic tundra
Tropical Wet Forest
Tropical wet forests are also referred to as tropical rainforests This biome is found in equatorial regions
Figure 4412 The vegetation is characterized by plants with broad leaves that fall and are replaced throughout
the year Unlike the trees of deciduous forests the trees in this biome do not have a seasonal loss of leaves
associated with variations in temperature and sunlight these forests are evergreen yearround
The temperature and sunlight profiles of tropical wet forests are very stable in comparison to that of other
terrestrial biomes with the temperatures ranging from 20 C to 34 C 68 F to 93 F When one compares
the annual temperature variation of tropical wet forests with that of other forest biomes the lack of seasonal
temperature variation in the tropical wet forest becomes apparent This lack of seasonality leads to yearround
plant growth rather than the seasonal spring summer and fall growth seen in other more temperate biomes
In contrast to other ecosystems tropical ecosystems do not have long days and short days during the yearly
cycle Instead a constant daily amount of sunlight 1112 hrs per day provides more solar radiation thereby a
longer period of time for plant growth
The annual rainfall in tropical wet forests ranges from 125 cm to 660 cm 50200 in with some monthly variation
While sunlight and temperature remain fairly consistent annual rainfall is highly variable Tropical wet forests
typically have wet months in which there can be more than 30 cm 1112 in of precipitation as well as dry
months in which there are fewer than 10 cm 35 in of rainfall However the driest month of a tropical wet forest
still exceeds the annual rainfall of some other biomes such as deserts
Tropical wet forests have high net primary productivity because the annual temperatures and precipitation values
in these areas are ideal for plant growth Therefore the extensive biomass present in the tropical wet forest
leads to plant communities with very high species diversities Figure 4413 Tropical wet forests have more
species of trees than any other biome on average between 100 and 300 species of trees are present in a
single hectare 25 acres of South American Amazonian rain forest One way to visualize this is to compare the
distinctive horizontal layers within the tropical wet forest biome On the forest floor is a sparse layer of plants
and decaying plant matter Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage A layer of trees rises above this
understory and is topped by a closed upper canopythe uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves
