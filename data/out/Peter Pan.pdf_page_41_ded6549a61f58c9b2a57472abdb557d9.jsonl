With funny little red walls
And roof of mossy green
They gurgled with joy at this for by the greatest good luck the
branches they had brought were sticky with red sap and all the
ground was carpeted with moss As they rattled up the little house
they broke into song themselves
Weve built the little walls and roof
And made a lovely door
So tell us mother Wendy
What are you wanting more
To this she answered greedily
Oh really next I think Ill have
Gay windows all about
With roses peeping in you know
And babies peeping out
With a blow of their fists they made windows and large yellow
leaves were the blinds But roses
Roses cried Peter sternly
Quickly they madebelieve to grow the loveliest roses up the
walls
Babies
To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again
Weve made the roses peeping out
The babes are at the door
We cannot make ourselves you know
Cos weve been made before
Peter seeing this to be a good idea at once pretended that it was
his own The house was quite beautiful and no doubt Wendy was
very cosy within though of course they could no longer see her
Peter strode up and down ordering finishing touches Nothing
escaped his eagle eyes Just when it seemed absolutely finished
Theres no knocker on the door he said
They were very ashamed but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe
and it made an excellent knocker
Absolutely finished now they thought
Not of bit of it Theres no chimney Peter said we must have a
chimney
It certainly does need a chimney said John importantly This
gave Peter an idea He snatched the hat off Johns head knocked out
the bottom and put the hat on the roof The little house was so
pleased to have such a capital chimney that as if to say thank you
smoke immediately began to come out of the hat
Now really and truly it was finished Nothing remained to do but
to knock
All look your best Peter warned them first impressions are
awfully important
