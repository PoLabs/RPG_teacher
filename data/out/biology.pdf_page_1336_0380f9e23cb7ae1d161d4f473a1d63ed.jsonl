Figure 4225 a Affinity refers to the strength of single interaction between antigen and antibody while avidity refers
to the strength of all interactions combined b An antibody may cross react with different epitopes
The term avidity describes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined multivalent structures such
as IgM and IgA Although avidity measures the strength of binding just as affinity does the avidity is not simply
the sum of the affinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure The avidity depends on the number of identical
binding sites on the antigen being detected as well as other physical and chemical factors Typically multimeric
antibodies such as pentameric IgM are classified as having lower affinity than monomeric antibodies but high
avidity Essentially the fact that multimeric antibodies can bind many antigens simultaneously balances their
slightly lower binding strength for each antibodyantigen interaction
Antibodies secreted after binding to one epitope on an antigen may exhibit cross reactivity for the same or similar
epitopes on different antigens Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region the surface area of
about four to six amino acids it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities
and orientations over short regions Cross reactivity describes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that
elicited its synthesis and secretion but to a different antigen
Cross reactivity can be beneficial if an individual develops immunity to several related pathogens despite having
only been exposed to or vaccinated against one of them For instance antibody cross reactivity may occur
against the similar surface structures of various Gramnegative bacteria Conversely antibodies raised against
pathogenic molecular components that resemble self molecules may incorrectly mark host cells for destruction
and cause autoimmune damage Patients who develop systemic lupus erythematosus SLE commonly exhibit
antibodies that react with their own DNA These antibodies may have been initially raised against the nucleic
acid of microorganisms but later crossreacted with selfantigens This phenomenon is also called molecular
mimicry
