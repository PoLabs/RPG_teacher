The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle
I
had called upon my friend Sherlock
Holmes upon the second morning after
Christmas with the intention of wishing
him the compliments of the season He was
lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressinggown
a piperack within his reach upon the right and a
pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly
studied near at hand Beside the couch was a wooden
chair and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy
and disreputable hardfelt hat much the worse for
wear and cracked in several places A lens and a
forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested
that the hat had been suspended in this manner for
the purpose of examination
You are engaged said I perhaps I interrupt
you
Not at all I am glad to have a friend with whom
I can discuss my results The matter is a perfectly
trivial onehe jerked his thumb in the direction of
the old hatbut there are points in connection with
it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even
of instruction
I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my
hands before his crackling re for a sharp frost had
set in and the windows were thick with the ice crys
tals I suppose I remarked that homely as it
looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to
itthat it is the clue which will guide you in the so
lution of some mystery and the punishment of some
crime
No no No crime said Sherlock Holmes laugh
ing Only one of those whimsical little incidents
which will happen when you have four million hu
man beings all jostling each other within the space of
a few square miles Amid the action and reaction of
so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combi
nation of events may be expected to take place and
many a little problem will be presented which may
be striking and bizarre without being criminal We
have already had experience of such
So much so I remarked that of the last six
cases which I have added to my notes three have
been entirely free of any legal crime
Precisely You allude to my attempt to recover
the Irene Adler papers to the singular case of Miss
Mary Sutherland and to the adventure of the man
with the twisted lip Well I have no doubt that this
small matter will fall into the same innocent category
You know Peterson the commissionaire
Yes
It is to him that this trophy belongs
It is his hat
No no he found it Its owner is unknown I beg
that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock
but as an intellectual problem And rst as to how
it came here It arrived upon Christmas morning in
company with a good fat goose which is I have no
doubt roasting at this moment in front of Petersons
re The facts are these about four oclock on Christ
mas morning Peterson who as you know is a very
honest fellow was returning from some small jolli
cation and was making his way homeward down
Tottenham Court Road In front of him he saw in the
gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger
and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder
As he reached the corner of Goodge Street a row
broke out between this stranger and a little knot of
roughs One of the latter knocked off the mans hat
on which he raised his stick to defend himself and
swinging it over his head smashed the shop win
dow behind him Peterson had rushed forward to
protect the stranger from his assailants but the man
shocked at having broken the window and seeing an
ofciallooking person in uniform rushing towards
him dropped his goose took to his heels and van
ished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at
the back of Tottenham Court Road The roughs had
also ed at the appearance of Peterson so that he was
left in possession of the eld of battle and also of the
spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and
a most unimpeachable Christmas goose
Which surely he restored to their owner
My dear fellow there lies the problem It is true
that For Mrs Henry Baker was printed upon a small
card which was tied to the birds left leg and it is also
true that the initials H B are legible upon the lining
of this hat but as there are some thousands of Bakers
and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of
ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one
of them
What then did Peterson do
He brought round both hat and goose to me on
Christmas morning knowing that even the smallest
problems are of interest to me The goose we retained
until this morning when there were signs that in
spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should
be eaten without unnecessary delay Its nder has
carried it off therefore to full the ultimate destiny
of a goose while I continue to retain the hat of the
unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner
Did he not advertise
No
