identification of keystone species where possible and for focusing protection efforts on those species likewise
it also makes sense to attempt to return them to their ecosystem if they have been removed
Figure 4717 a The Gibbon wolf pack in Yellowstone National Park March 1 2007 represents a keystone species
The reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park in 1995 led to a change in the grazing behavior of b
elk To avoid predation the elk no longer grazed exposed stream and riverbeds such as c the Lamar Riverbed
in Yellowstone This allowed willow and cottonwood seedlings to grow and recolonized large areas The seedlings
decreased erosion and provided shading to the creek which improved fish habitat A new colony of d beaver may
also have benefited from the habitat change credit a modification of work by Doug Smith NPS credit c modification

Other largescale restoration experiments underway involve dam removal which is a national movement that is
accelerating in importance In the United States since the mid1980s many aging dams are being considered
for removal rather than replacement because of shifting beliefs about the ecological value of freeflowing rivers
and because many dams no longer provide the benefit and functions that they did when they were first built
The measured benefits of dam removal include restoration of naturally fluctuating water levels the purpose
of dams is frequently to reduce variation in river flows which leads to increased fish diversity and improved
water quality In the Pacific Northwest dam removal projects are expected to increase populations of salmon
which is considered a keystone species because it transports key nutrients to inland ecosystems during its
annual spawning migrations In other regions such as the Atlantic coast dam removal has allowed the return of
spawning anadromous fish species species that are born in fresh water live most of their lives in salt water and
return to fresh water to spawn Some of the largest dam removal projects have yet to occur or have happened
too recently for the consequences to be measured The largescale ecological experiments that these removal
projects constitute will provide valuable data for other dam projects slated either for removal or construction
The Role of Captive Breeding
Zoos have sought to play a role in conservation efforts both through captive breeding programs and education
The transformation of the missions of zoos from collection and exhibition facilities to organizations that are
dedicated to conservation is ongoing and gaining strength In general it has been recognized that except in
some specific targeted cases captive breeding programs for endangered species are inefficient and often prone
to failure when the species are reintroduced to the wild However captive breeding programs have yielded some
success stories such as the American condor reintroduction to the Grand Canyon and the reestablishment of
the Whooping Crane along the Midwest flyway
Unfortunately zoo facilities are far too limited to contemplate captive breeding programs for the numbers of
species that are now at risk Education is another potential positive impact of zoos on conservation efforts
particularly given the global trend to urbanization and the consequent reduction in contacts between people and
wildlife A number of studies have been performed to look at the effectiveness of zoos on peoples attitudes and
actions regarding conservation at present the results tend to be mixed
