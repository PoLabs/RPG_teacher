52 DISTRIBUTING WEALTH
623
departure from the levelling trend throughout the continent and globally After 
a decrease in income and wealth inequalities in the postwar era from the 1970s 
onwards but increasingly after the collapse of state socialism we can again 
observe rising inequalities in income and wealth distribution The combined 
effects of economic globalisation and technological progress produced a 
rise in inequality which was famously described by Christoph Lakner and 
Branko Milanovic as an Elephant Curve Lakner and Milanovic argue that 
between 1988 and 2008 the global elite enjoyed massive income growth while 
traditional middle classes and the poor saw their income stagnate However 
new middle classes outside the Global North experienced a rapid growth in 
income While the accuracy of the chart and the methodology behind it has 
been disputed it nonetheless serves as a powerful symbol of rising global 
inequality a process which seemingly leads to even greater concentration of 
wealthif it is not regulated by political action European models providing 
free education and healthcare proved relatively successful in limiting income 
inequality and according to recent scholarly investigations in relative terms 
Europe remains the most equal region of the world
