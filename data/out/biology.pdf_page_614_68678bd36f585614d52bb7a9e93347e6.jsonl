The Evolution of Prokaryotes
How do scientists answer questions about the evolution of prokaryotes Unlike with animals artifacts in
the fossil record of prokaryotes offer very little information Fossils of ancient prokaryotes look like tiny
bubbles in rock Some scientists turn to genetics and to the principle of the molecular clock which holds
that the more recently two species have diverged the more similar their genes and thus proteins will be
Conversely species that diverged long ago will have more genes that are dissimilar
Scientists at the NASA Astrobiology Institute and at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
collaborated to analyze the molecular evolution of 32 specific proteins common to 72 species of
prokaryotes

The model they derived from their data indicates that three important groups of
bacteriaActinobacteria Deinococcus and Cyanobacteria collectively called Terrabacteria by the
authorswere the first to colonize land Actinobacteria are a group of very common Grampositive bacteria
that produce branched structures like fungal mycelia and include species important in decomposition of
organic wastes You will recall that Deinococcus is a genus of bacterium that is highly resistant to ionizing
radiation It has a thick peptidoglycan layer in addition to a second external membrane so it has features of
both Grampositive and Gramnegative bacteria
Cyanobacteria are photosynthesizers and were probably responsible for the production of oxygen on the
ancient earth The timelines of divergence suggest that bacteria members of the domain Bacteria diverged
from common ancestral species between 25 and 32 billion years ago whereas the Archaea diverged
earlier between 31 and 41 billion years ago Eukarya later diverged from the archaean line The work
further suggests that stromatolites that formed prior to the advent of cyanobacteria about 26 billion years
ago photosynthesized in an anoxic environment and that because of the modifications of the Terrabacteria
for land resistance to drying and the possession of compounds that protect the organism from excess light
photosynthesis using oxygen may be closely linked to adaptations to survive on land
223  Prokaryotic Metabolism
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify the macronutrients needed by prokaryotes and explain their importance

Describe the ways in which prokaryotes get energy and carbon for life processes

Describe the roles of prokaryotes in the carbon and nitrogen cycles
Prokaryotes are metabolically diverse organisms In many cases a prokaryote may be placed into a species
clade by its defining metabolic features Can it metabolize lactose Can it grow on citrate Does it produce
H2S Does it ferment carbohydrates to produce acid and gas Can it grow under anaerobic conditions Since
metabolism and metabolites are the product of enzyme pathways and enzymes are encoded in genes the
metabolic capabilities of a prokaryote are a reflection of its genome There are many different environments
on Earth with various energy and carbon sources and variable conditions to which prokaryotes may be
able to adapt Prokaryotes have been able to live in every environment from deepwater volcanic vents to
Antarctic ice by using whatever energy and carbon sources are available Prokaryotes fill many niches on Earth
including involvement in nitrogen and carbon cycles photosynthetic production of oxygen decomposition of
dead organisms and thriving as parasitic commensal or mutualistic organisms inside multicellular organisms
including humans The very broad range of environments that prokaryotes occupy is possible because they have
diverse metabolic processes
