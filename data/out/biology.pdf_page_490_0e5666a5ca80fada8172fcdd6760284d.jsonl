percent risk of developing Alzheimers The scientists used databases and several publications to analyze the
genomic data Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and analytical tools are becoming
more reliable researchers still must address ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level
Figure 1715 PCA3 is a gene that is expressed in prostate epithelial cells and overexpressed in cancerous cells
A high PCA3 concentration in urine is indicative of prostate cancer The PCA3 test is a better indicator of cancer
than the more well known PSA test which measures the level of PSA prostatespecific antigen in the blood
In 2011 the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to
screen healthy men for prostate cancer Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does
not reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not
cause problems while the cancer treatment can have severe side effects The PCA3 test is more accurate
but screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer itself suffering side
effects from treatment What do you think Should all healthy men receive prostate cancer screenings using
the PCA3 or PSA test Should people in general receive screenings to find out if they have a genetic risk
for cancer or other diseases
Pharmacogenomics and Toxicogenomics
Pharmacogenomics or toxicogenomics involves evaluating drug effectiveness and safety on the basis of
information from an individuals genomic sequence We can study genomic responses to drugs using
experimental animals such as laboratory rats or mice or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies
with humans Studying changes in gene expression could provide information about the transcription profile
in the drugs presence which we can use as an early indicator of the potential for toxic effects For example
genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death when disturbed could lead to cancerous cell growth
Genomewide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity Medical professionals can use
personal genome sequence information to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on
the basis of the individual patients genotype The gene signatures may not be completely accurate but medical
professionals can test them further before pathologic symptoms arise
Microbial Genomics Metagenomics
Traditionally scholars have taught microbiology with the view that it is best to study microorganisms under
pure culture conditions This involves isolating a single cell type and culturing it in the laboratory Because
microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours their gene expression profiles adapt to
the new laboratory environment very quickly In addition the vast majority of bacterial species resist culturing in
isolation Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities but in microbial communities or biofilms For all of
these reasons pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms Metagenomics is the study of
the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche Metagenomics can
