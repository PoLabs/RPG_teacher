described and were often the subject of heated debates conflicts protests and 
other disruptive practices
Price controls were common in the period As Historian Keith Thomas 
notes in ancien rgime societies a good part of the population was more 
concerned with avoiding risks in the regular supply of essential resources 
than with maximising benefits or income This does not mean that there were 
no opportunistic individuals who tried to accumulate lands or properties 
but amassing riches was a unique activity and required solid justifications 
Defence against such individuals and their activities was a general aim of 
economic measures such as the control of prices In many polities of early 
modern Europe different authorities issued norms to establish a just price for 
essential goods such as wheat or kneaded and baked bread or clothing These 
measures were aimed at avoiding shortages curbing prices and mitigating 
the effects of inflation on the price of basic commodities 
Usury was a traditional moral and financial problem Justus Lipsius 
expressed forcefully the problematic interconnection between morals and 
wealth Virtue and God never love him who loves wealth Given this moral 
framework it is not surprising to see that it was usually theologians who wrote 
about profits between 1500 and 1750 And they wrote on such matters because 
they were concerned about their moral consequences and ultimately about 
the salvation of souls This strong tradition of Jewish Muslim and Christian 
thought about money and exchange was inherited from the Middle Ages 
Usury the exigence of additional money in exchange for lending money 
together with several strategies to disguise money loans were considered 
both a vice and a sin Money changes and other contracts which involved 
exchanges of goods were cautiously regulated Controlling benefits can be 
considered as a form of distributing wealth since it aims to avoid excessive 
inequalities but also as a form of social control since it restricts the creation 
of wealth
Inequality in Practice
Based on the reconstruction of data series through empirical research we can 
observe that overall inequality was rising throughout the period between 1450 
and 1800 This goes up for various places and periods and is based on various 
approaches of assessing and measuring inequality Most of such work on 
inequality takes households as units of analyses as data are best reconstructed 
on that level It is worthwhile however to look somewhat more in depth at 
how this general trend took shape in particular settings and what caused the 
exceptional cases that went against this trend
