same chromosome to be inherited together homologous recombination biases alleles toward an independent
inheritance pattern
132 Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders
The number size shape and banding pattern of chromosomes make them easily identifiable in a karyogram
and allows for the assessment of many chromosomal abnormalities Disorders in chromosome number or
aneuploidies are typically lethal to the embryo although a few trisomic genotypes are viable Because of X
inactivation aberrations in sex chromosomes typically have milder phenotypic effects Aneuploidies also
include instances in which a chromosomes segments duplicate or delete themselves Inversion or
translocation also may rearrange chromosome structures Both of these aberrations can result in problematic
phenotypic effects Because they force chromosomes to assume unnatural topologies during meiosis
inversions and translocations often occur with reduced fertility because of the likelihood of nondisjunction
VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS
1 Figure 133 In a test cross for two characteristics
such as the one shown here can the predicted
frequency of recombinant offspring be 60 percent
Why or why not
2 Figure 134 Which of the following statements is
true
a
Recombination of the body color and red
cinnabar eye alleles will occur more
frequently than recombination of the alleles
for wing length and aristae length
b
Recombination of the body color and aristae
length alleles will occur more frequently than
recombination of redbrown eye alleles and
the aristae length alleles
c
Recombination of the grayblack body color
and longshort aristae alleles will not occur
d
Recombination of the redbrown eye and
longshort aristae alleles will occur more
frequently than recombination of the alleles
for wing length and body color
3 Figure 136 Which of the following statements
about nondisjunction is true
a
Nondisjunction only results in gametes with
n1 or n1 chromosomes
b
Nondisjunction occurring during meiosis II
results in 50 percent normal gametes
c
Nondisjunction during meiosis I results in 50
percent normal gametes
d
Nondisjunction always results in four
different kinds of gametes
