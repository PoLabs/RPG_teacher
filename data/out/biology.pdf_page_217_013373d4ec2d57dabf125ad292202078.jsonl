the end of both steps
Step 2 The hydroxyethyl group is oxidized to an acetyl group and the electrons are picked up by NAD forming
NADH The highenergy electrons from NADH will be used later to generate ATP
Step 3 The enzymebound acetyl group is transferred to CoA producing a molecule of acetyl CoA
Figure 78 Upon entering the mitochondrial matrix a multienzyme complex converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA In the
process carbon dioxide is released and one molecule of NADH is formed
Note that during the second stage of glucose metabolism whenever a carbon atom is removed it is bound to
two oxygen atoms producing carbon dioxide one of the major end products of cellular respiration
Acetyl CoA to CO2
In the presence of oxygen acetyl CoA delivers its acetyl 2C group to a fourcarbon molecule oxaloacetate
to form citrate a sixcarbon molecule with three carboxyl groups this pathway will harvest the remainder of the
extractable energy from what began as a glucose molecule and release the remaining four CO2 molecules This
single pathway is called by different names the citric acid cycle for the first intermediate formedcitric acid
or citratewhen acetate joins to the oxaloacetate the TCA cycle because citric acid or citrate and isocitrate
are tricarboxylic acids and the Krebs cycle after Hans Krebs who first identified the steps in the pathway in
the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles
Citric Acid Cycle
Like the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA the citric acid cycle takes place in the matrix of mitochondria
Almost all of the enzymes of the citric acid cycle are soluble with the single exception of the enzyme succinate
dehydrogenase which is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion Unlike glycolysis the citric
acid cycle is a closed loop the last part of the pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step The
eight steps of the cycle are a series of redox dehydration hydration and decarboxylation reactions that produce
two carbon dioxide molecules one GTPATP and the reduced carriers NADH and FADH2 Figure 79 This is
considered an aerobic pathway because the NADH and FADH2 produced must transfer their electrons to the
next pathway in the system which will use oxygen If this transfer does not occur the oxidation steps of the citric
acid cycle also do not occur Note that the citric acid cycle produces very little ATP directly and does not directly
consume oxygen
