members who drew on scientific training and who regarded both nation
states and the international system as relevant arenas for action The interwar 
period even fostered their direct engagement in international politics through 
the League of Nations 19201946 which provided the first bureaucratic 
infrastructure for international environmentalism Modernist belief in the 
human ability to master nature had been shaken by the rise of pollution and 
critical scientists were among the first to perceive its negative consequences 
After 1945 Europe witnessed an increase in international scientific exchange 
and the entry of this exchange as a relevant factor in politics and policy fields 
For example scientists from industrialised countries met regularly to discuss 
measures to fight air pollution such as after the Great Smog of London in 
1952 However policy mostly focused on endofpipe solutions that tackled 
problems like air pollution by building chimneys to disperse smoke rather 
than reducing the problem at its source by installing filters or reducing the 
consumption of coal
While environmentalist ideas grievances and organisations thus had 
deep roots it was not until after the Second World War that ecological issues 
became the object of intense political contention Concerned scientists like the 
American Rachel Carson 19071964 whose book Silent Spring 1962 led to 
the banning of dangerous pesticides helped place certain problems on the 
political agenda
But policy changes especially at the international level always suffered 
a certain time lag Oil pollution in the sea is a case in point While technical 
solutions like oil separators in ships already existed at the beginning of 
the twentieth century their implementation long remained a political and 
economic matter An International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness 
Response and Cooperation was only agreed in 1990 though the League of 
Nations had tried to address the problem as early as the interwar period This 
conflict over oil pollution lasted half a century for two reasons on the one 
hand the sea as a transnational space long remained an unlegislated terra 
nullius in which state and nonstate actors alike dumped chemical nuclear 
plastic and other hazardous waste which only began to be regulated with the 
1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes 
and Other Matter London Convention On the other hand the question of 
who would pay for the costs of pollution remained unresolved 
As environmental problems are borderless societies increasingly 
recognised that they were interdependent One key turning point at the 
international level was the discovery by Swedish scientists that air pollution 
from industrial centres in West Germany the United Kingdom and countries 
in Eastern Europe like the German Democratic Republic or Poland caused the 
acidification of Swedish lakes and rivers This became one reason for the United 
Nations to convene the Conference on the Human Environment UNCHE in
