Oh dear oh dear cried Wendy Im sure I sometimes think that
spinsters are to be envied
She told them to clear away and sat down to her workbasket a
heavy load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual
Wendy remonstrated Michael Im too big for a cradle
I must have somebody in a cradle she said almost tartly and
you are the littlest A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have
about a house
While she sewed they played around her such a group of happy
faces and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire It had become a
very familiar scene this in the home under the ground but we are
looking on it for the last time
There was a step above and Wendy you may be sure was the first
to recognize it
Children I hear your fathers step He likes you to meet him at
the door
Above the redskins crouched before Peter
Watch well braves I have spoken
And then as so often before the gay children dragged him from
his tree As so often before but never again
He had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for
Wendy
Peter you just spoil them you know Wendy simpered
Ah old lady said Peter hanging up his gun
It was me told him mothers are called old lady Michael
whispered to Curly
I complain of Michael said Curly instantly
The first twin came to Peter Father we want to dance
Dance away my little man said Peter who was in high good
humour
But we want you to dance
Peter was really the best dancer among them but he pretended to
be scandalised
Me My old bones would rattle
And mummy too
What cried Wendy the mother of such an armful dance
But on a Saturday night Slightly insinuated
It was not really Saturday night at least it may have been for they
had long lost count of the days but always if they wanted to do
anything special they said this was Saturday night and then they did
it
Of course it is Saturday night Peter Wendy said relenting
People of our figure Wendy
But it is only among our own progeny
True true
So they were told they could dance but they must put on their
nighties first
