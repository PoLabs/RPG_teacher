Im halfandhalf said Seamus Me dads a Muggle Mom didnt tell
him she was a witch til after they were married Bit of a nasty shock
for him
The others laughed
What about you Neville said Ron
Well my gran brought me up and shes a witch said Neville but the
family thought I was all Muggle for ages My Great Uncle Algie kept
trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me  he
pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once I nearly drowned  but
nothing happened until I was eight Great Uncle Algie came round for
dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles
when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let
go But I bounced  all the way down the garden and into the road They
were all really pleased Gran was crying she was so happy And you
should have seen their faces when I got in here  they thought I might
not be magic enough to come you see Great Uncle Algie was so pleased
he bought me my toad
On Harrys other side Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about
lessons I do hope they start right away theres so much to learn Im
particularly interested in Transfiguration you know turning something
into something else of course its supposed to be very difficult
Youll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of
thing  
Harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at
the High Table again Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore Professor
Quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy
black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin
It happened very suddenly The hooknosed teacher looked past Quirrells
turban straight into Harrys eyes  and a sharp hot pain shot across
the scar on Harrys forehead
Ouch Harry clapped a hand to his head
What is it asked Percy
