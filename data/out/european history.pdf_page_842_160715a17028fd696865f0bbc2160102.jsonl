well as quickly going through numerous Latin editions it was translated into 
national vernaculars across Europe and subsequently the world and was used 
to justify critical and even revolutionary agendas with which More would have 
beento say the leastuncomfortable But significantly Utopia also gave rise 
to the concept and language of utopianism the label now used to describe 
the capacity for people to transcend the circumstances and power structures of 
their immediate and particular lives in order to imagine ways of living based on 
idealistic principles This capacity was not always regarded positively styling 
someone or something utopian was as likely to be a criticism as a compliment 
in the period However utopianism nevertheless became an important feature 
of early modernand indeed modernculture It did so as a new genre with 
writers like Francis Bacon and James Harrington famously creating their own 
imaginary worlds in order to explore and critique arrangements of ideas and 
values And it did so as a practice with men and women responding to the 
cultural ferment of the Renaissance and Reformation by participating in new 
and distinct societies and communities based on principles of their own 
choosing and experimenting with ideas about class gender and sexuality that 
transgressed existing patriarchal and respectable norms
 This chapter considers the impact of Utopia in these two respects The first 
section introduces the text itself and shows how through its translation into 
national vernaculars Mores Utopia could take on practical and contemporary 
relevance despite its fictionality and classicism The following section then 
outlines some of those early modern utopian experiments in communal 
living and patterns of behaviour which contradicted prevalent conventions of 
patriarchy society and sexuality
Thomas Mores Utopia
Utopia meaning no place in Greek was an imaginary island described by 
More through a fictional dialogue between a traveller and explorer called 
Hythloday and a character called Morus Reflecting the real encounters of 
Europeans with distant and unfamiliar people in the course of their exploration 
of the globe Utopia ostensibly described very credibly yet another such 
encounter However readers with an appreciation of Latin and Greek would 
have recognised Mores many puns and jokes as well as his deep and critical 
engagement with classical political theory They might also have noticed that 
the longest final chapter described how the majority of Utopians voluntarily 
chose a mode of religion with many resemblances to the kind of reformed 
Christianity espoused by More albeit a decade before the challenge posed 
by Martin Luther turned More into both a persecutor of Protestants and a 
Catholic martyr
