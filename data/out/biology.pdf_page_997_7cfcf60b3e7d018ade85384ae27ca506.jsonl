are known as double fertilization Figure 3218 After fertilization is complete no other sperm can enter The
fertilized ovule forms the seed whereas the tissues of the ovary become the fruit usually enveloping the seed
Figure 3218 In angiosperms one sperm fertilizes the egg to form the 2n zygote and the other sperm fertilizes the
central cell to form the 3n endosperm This is called a double fertilization
After fertilization the zygote divides to form two cells the upper cell or terminal cell and the lower or basal cell
The division of the basal cell gives rise to the suspensor which eventually makes connection with the maternal
tissue The suspensor provides a route for nutrition to be transported from the mother plant to the growing
embryo The terminal cell also divides giving rise to a globularshaped proembryo Figure 3219a In dicots
eudicots the developing embryo has a heart shape due to the presence of the two rudimentary cotyledons
Figure 3219b In nonendospermic dicots such as Capsella bursa the endosperm develops initially but is
then digested and the food reserves are moved into the two cotyledons As the embryo and cotyledons enlarge
they run out of room inside the developing seed and are forced to bend Figure 3219c Ultimately the embryo
and cotyledons fill the seed Figure 3219d and the seed is ready for dispersal Embryonic development is
suspended after some time and growth is resumed only when the seed germinates The developing seedling
will rely on the food reserves stored in the cotyledons until the first set of leaves begin photosynthesis
