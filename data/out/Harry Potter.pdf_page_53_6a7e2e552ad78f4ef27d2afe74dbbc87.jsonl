Harry wouldnt have noticed it was there The people hurrying by didnt
glance at it Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the
record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the Leaky Cauldron at
all In fact Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and
Hagrid could see it Before he could mention this Hagrid had steered
him inside
For a famous place it was very dark and shabby A few old women were
sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry One of them was
smoking a long pipe A little man in a top hat was talking to the old
bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut The
low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in Everyone seemed to know
Hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a
glass saying The usual Hagrid
Cant Tom Im on Hogwarts business said Hagrid clapping his great
hand on Harrys shoulder and making Harrys knees buckle
Good Lord said the bartender peering at Harry is this  can this
be 
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent
Bless my soul whispered the old bartender Harry Potter what an
honor
He hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward Harry and seized his
hand tears in his eyes
Welcome back Mr Potter welcome back
Harry didnt know what to say Everyone was looking at him The old
woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out
Hagrid was beaming
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment Harry
found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron
Doris Crockford Mr Potter cant believe Im meeting you at last
So proud Mr Potter Im just so proud
