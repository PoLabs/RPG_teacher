Introduction
Political borders in twentiethcentury Europe are usually thought of as lines 
on a map separating one nationstate from another In practice however 
there are many borderlands and border zones where belonging is ambiguous 
arbitrary or unstable Throughout the twentieth century European borders 
shifted repeatedly and some have reemerged or continued to divide people 
long after being dismantled What borders mean and how they are represented 
has also changed over time This chapter examines how European borders 
changed over the course of the twentieth century and analyses what they have 
meant at different times 
Border Shifts
There were three major waves of border changes in twentiethcentury Europe 
each tied to the settlement of war from 19181919 at the end of the First World 
War in 1945 at the end of the Second World War and from 19891991 following 
the end of the Cold War
The First World War led to the disintegration of land empires within 
Europe and the creation of new nationstates from their former domains For 
populations that had long felt stifled under the rule of distant powers the 
1918 peace conference at Versailles presented an opportunity for national self
determination that would bring similar people together within independent 
states For othersespecially minorities and the inhabitants of mixed regions 
like Silesia or cities like Danzig now Gdask Poland Triest now Trieste
