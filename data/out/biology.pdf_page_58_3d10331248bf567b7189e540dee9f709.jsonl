charge on the more electronegative atoms usually oxygen or nitrogen or within the same molecule Scientists
call this interaction a hydrogen bond This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water
molecules Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken however they occur in very large numbers
in water and in organic polymers creating a major force in combination Hydrogen bonds are also responsible
for zipping together the DNA double helix
Like hydrogen bonds van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules Van
der Waals attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations
of the electron densities which are not always symmetrical around an atom For these attractions to happen
the molecules need to be very close to one another These bondsalong with ionic covalent and hydrogen
bondscontribute to the proteins threedimensional structure in our cells that is necessary for their proper
function
Pharmaceutical Chemist
Pharmaceutical chemists are responsible for developing new drugs and trying to determine the mode of
action of both old and new drugs They are involved in every step of the drug development process We can
find drugs in the natural environment or we can synthesize them in the laboratory In many cases chemists
chemically change potential drugs from nature chemically in the laboratory to make them safer and more
effective and sometimes synthetic versions of drugs substitute for the version we find in nature
After a drugs initial discovery or synthesis the chemist then develops the drug perhaps chemically altering
it testing it to see if it is toxic and then designing methods for efficient largescale production Then the
process of approving the drug for human use begins In the United States the Food and Drug Administration
FDA handles drug approval This involves a series of largescale experiments using human subjects to
ensure the drug is not harmful and effectively treats the condition for which it is intended This process often
takes several years and requires the participation of physicians and scientists in addition to chemists to
complete testing and gain approval
An example of a drug that was originally discovered in a living organism is Paclitaxel Taxol an anticancer
drug used to treat breast cancer This drug was discovered in the bark of the pacific yew tree Another
example is aspirin originally isolated from willow tree bark Finding drugs often means testing hundreds of
samples of plants fungi and other forms of life to see if they contain any biologically active compounds
Sometimes traditional medicine can give modern medicine clues as to where to find an active compound
For example mankind has used willow bark to make medicine for thousands of years dating back to ancient
Egypt However it was not until the late 1800s that scientists and pharmaceutical companies purified and
marketed the aspirin molecule acetylsalicylic acid for human use
Occasionally drugs developed for one use have unforeseen effects that allow usage in other unrelated
ways For example scientists originally developed the drug minoxidil Rogaine to treat high blood pressure
When tested on humans researchers noticed that individuals taking the drug would grow new hair
Eventually the pharmaceutical company marketed the drug to men and women with baldness to restore lost
hair
A pharmaceutical chemists career may involve detective work experimentation and drug development all
with the goal of making human beings healthier
