and established parliamentarism in both halves In the Austrian half of the 
Monarchy Cisleithania the constitution of 1867 secured rather generous 
national rights for the corresponding ethnic groups In addition voting rights 
in Austria were gradually extended by electoral reforms in the late nineteenth 
century while universal manhood suffrage the right of all adult male citizens 
to vote was introduced in 1907 As a result the demands of nationalities were 
increasingly articulated in the Imperial Parliament causing severe tensions 
In the constitutionally autonomous Hungarian Kingdom Transleithania 
voting rights remained limited to a narrow circle of around six percent of the 
adult population and ethnic minorities were severely underrepresented in 
Parliament Although the rights of nationalities were stated in an important 
law of 1868 state policies in late nineteenth and early twentiethcentury 
Hungary were a de facto curtailment of minorities cultural and linguistic 
rights and especially from the mid1890s these policies strove to forcefully 
assimilate nonHungarians All this together led to an increasingly strained 
relationship between the Hungarian state and members of national and ethnic 
minorities The nationality problem thus plagued domestic politics in both 
halves of the AustroHungarian Monarchy and contributed substantially to its 
dissolution in 1918 
Still the constellations were diverse In Bohemia the rise of the Czech 
nation markedly visible already during the revolution of 1848 led to intense 
struggle with an outnumbered yet economically strong German minority 
which benefited from Germanophone networks and the German character of 
the Austrian state In the province of Galicia both Ruthenians and Poles were 
given broad space for their respective national activities But it was the Poles 
betterpositioned in society who assumed political control of the province 
The sense of belonging to a distinct ethnic community was arguably 
stronger in cases like those of the Czechs and the Poles who could rely upon a 
long literary tradition in their own printed language and a legacy of statehood 
The latter was still very much alive in the Polish case while the ethnic identity 
of other peoples such as Ukrainians or Slovaks was weaker at the threshold 
of the age of nations But even among these groups ethnic identity was 
not simply out there waiting to be taken to the fore by nationalists Rather 
national movements helped define and reinforce ethnic identities in the first 
place building upon existing cultural markers such as language or religion 
Ethnic identity was often unclear for many people not to mention irrelevant 
to their everyday lives Many people spoke two or more languages and 
switched depending on the situation while identifying themselves primarily 
by profession social status place of living or confession rather than ethnicity 
or nationality Polish peasants for instance for a long time had little interest 
in the efforts of the Polish nobility and gentry to restore the Polish state as
