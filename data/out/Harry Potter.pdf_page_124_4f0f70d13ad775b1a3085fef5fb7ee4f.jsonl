Come on he said to Ron He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady
and climbed through the hole
Hermione wasnt going to give up that easily She followed Ron through
the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose
Dont you care about Gryffindor do you only care about yourselves I
dont want Slytherin to win the house cup and youll lose all the
points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching
Spells
Go away All right but I warned you you just remember what I said
when youre on the train home tomorrow youre so 
But what they were they didnt find out Hermione had turned to the
portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an
empty painting The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione
was locked out of Gryffindor tower
Now what am I going to do she asked shrilly
Thats your problem said Ron Weve got to go we 3 re going to be
late
They hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up
with them
Im coming with you she said
You are not
Dyou think Im going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me
If he finds all three of us Ill tell him the truth that I was trying
to stop you and you can back me up
Youve got some nerve  said Ron loudly
Shut up both of you said Harry sharply I heard something
It was a sort of snuffling
Mrs Norris breathed Ron squinting through the dark
