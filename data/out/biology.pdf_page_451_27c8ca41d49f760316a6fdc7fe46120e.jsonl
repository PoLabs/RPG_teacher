Figure 165 Regulation of the lac operon Transcription of the lac operon is carefully regulated so that its
expression only occurs when glucose is limited and lactose is present to serve as an alternative fuel source
Question In E coli the trp operon is on by default while the lac operon is off Why do you think this is the
case
If glucose is present then CAP fails to bind to the promoter sequence to activate transcription If lactose is
absent then the repressor binds to the operator to prevent transcription If either of these conditions is met
then transcription remains off Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present is the lac operon transcribed
