integral part of academic life as memberships in international scientific 
associations Technical innovations fostered transnational exchanges with 
infrastructures such as railroads steamships and telegraph poles making it 
possible for academic and cultural circles to establish contacts with foreign 
colleagues Technical universities and research laboratories were established 
and led to a professionalisation of scientific research and education in natural 
and technical sciences 
With the outbreak of the First World War transnational exchange in 
culture science and education came to a temporary halt The initial war 
euphoria in European societies produced a collective mentality called 
Burgfrieden in Germany and union sacre in France Scientists often showed 
solidarity with the political and military ambitions of their respective nations 
Professors dissolved their cooperation with colleagues from universities in 
enemy countries Numerous researchers returned the honours and prizes 
they had received abroad and research administrators excluded colleagues 
from enemy countries from their academies and associations In return 
researchers supported national war objectives with their specialist knowledge 
Engineers chemists and physicists in particular supported national military 
interests through warrelated research The German chemist Fritz Haber for 
example enabled through his research the use of the poison gases chlorine 
and phosgene as weapons of war The war was also supported by humanities 
scholars and cultural workers German artists and writers signed for example 
the socalled Manifesto of the NinetyThree in which they declared unity 
between the German military and German intellectuals The First World War 
thus also became a war of brains
Even if international cooperation in science culture and education 
experienced a renaissance in the interwar period the nationalist esprit continued 
to affect the mindsets of many intellectuals For example the reorganisation 
of international scientific cooperation in the newly founded International 
Research Council IRC after the First World War excluded German and 
Austrian scientists Even scientists from countries that were neutral during 
the warsuch as the Scandinavian countries the Netherlands Spain and 
Switzerlandwere only reluctantly admitted as members of the IRC The 
lines of conflict of the First World War were thus maintained Nevertheless 
many countries hoped for prestige and a better standing through international 
appearances For example the engineer and inventor Leon Theremin who 
constructed the first motion detector in Russia and the worlds first electronic 
musical instrument the theremin was staged as a symbol for the genius of 
Soviet scientific life In the 1920s Theremin toured the USSR Central and 
Western Europe and the USA performing with his musical instrument in front 
of crowds illustrating the power of Soviet physics
