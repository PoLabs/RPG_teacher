managed depending on economic cycles to put pressure on owners and the 
state in order to soften the most flagrant conditions of precarity winningfor 
examplereforms such as health or social insurance During the Cold War 
the labour movements managed to effectively harness the fears of western 
states in order to create and maintain welfare state models that guaranteed 
steady wage growth and thus the overall improvement of working conditions 
at least during the thirty years after the Second World War 
However the role of trade unions as a mediating body between workers 
and owners interests was deeply questioned in some parts of Europe 
for example in Italy in the 1960s and 1970s The experience of workerism 
operaismo as a particular kind of labour movement resulted from the 
tumultuous industrialisation of the Italian Peninsula and the massive influx 
of labour migrants from the Italian South to the North Lombardy Piedmont 
EmiliaRomagna These workers started to question their working conditions 
as well as their living conditions and began to formulate a particularly strong 
critique against the alienation of their work By the end of the 1960s Italian

as gas or electricity In the East a similar workers struggle can be found in the

state and the labour movements The results of this new ideology were the 
destruction of the centralised workplace such as factories by a fragmentation 
of the production cycle and the extensive use of subcontracting Some of the 
reforms achieved during the postwar decades were kept but their distribution 
was deeply uneven among the different countries of the EU The process of 
dismantling the welfare state in Europe was accelerated by the fall of the Soviet 
bloc in the early 1990s and the enlargement of the EU to include countries 
whose economies had been transformed by neoliberal shock therapy 
Changing Workingclass Cultures
The changing nature of work in the twentieth century carried with it important 
shifts in workingclass cultures The gradual improvement of workers literacy 
was an important trend with transformative results for both the nature of 
work itself and the conditions of the workers who started to engage more
