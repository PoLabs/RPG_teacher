also lightened by the replacement of heavy jawbones and teeth with a beak made of keratin just as hair scales
and feathers are
Figure 2933 Pneumatic bone Many birds have hollow pneumatic bones which make flight easier
Other modifications that reduce weight include the lack of a urinary bladder Birds possess a cloaca an external
body cavity into which the intestinal urinary and genital orifices empty in reptiles birds and the monotreme
mammals The cloaca allows water to be reabsorbed from waste back into the bloodstream Thus uric acid is
not eliminated as a liquid but is concentrated into urate salts which are expelled along with fecal matter In this
way water is not held in a urinary bladder which would increase body weight In addition the females of most
bird species only possess one functional left ovary rather than two further reducing body mass
The respiratory system of birds is dramatically different from that of reptiles and mammals and is well adapted
for the high metabolic rate required for flight To begin the air spaces of pneumatic bone are sometimes
connected to air sacs in the body cavity which replace coelomic fluid and also lighten the body These air sacs
are also connected to the path of airflow through the birds body and function in respiration Unlike mammalian
lungs in which air flows in two directions as it is breathed in and out diluting the concentration of oxygen airflow
through bird lungs is unidirectional Figure 2934 Gas exchange occurs in air capillaries or microscopic air
passages within the lungs The arrangement of air capillaries in the lungs creates a countercurrent exchange
system with the pulmonary blood In a countercurrent system the air flows in one direction and the blood
flows in the opposite direction producing a favorable diffusion gradient and creating an efficient means of gas
exchange This very effective oxygendelivery system of birds supports their higher metabolic activity In effect
ventilation is provided by the parabronchi minimally expandible lungs with thin air sacs located among the
visceral organs and the skeleton A syrinx voice box resides near the junction of the trachea and bronchi The
syrinx however is not homologous to the mammalian larynx which resides within the upper part of the trachea
Figure 2934 Air flow in bird lungs Avian respiration is an efficient system of gas exchange with air flowing
unidirectionally A full ventilation cycle takes two breathing cycles During the first inhalation air passes from the
trachea into posterior air sacs then during the first exhalation into the lungs The second inhalation moves the air in the
lungs to the anterior air sacs and the second exhalation moves the air in the anterior air sacs out of the body Overall
each inhalation moves air into the air sacs while each exhalation moves fresh air through the lungs and used air out
of the body The air sacs are connected to the hollow interior of bones credit modification of work by L Shyamal
Beyond the unique characteristics discussed above birds are also unusual vertebrates because of a number
of other features First they typically have an elongate very dinosaurian Sshaped neck but a short tail or
pygostyle produced from the fusion of the caudal vertebrae Unlike mammals birds have only one occipital
condyle allowing them extensive movement of the head and neck They also have a very thin epidermis without
sweat glands and a specialized uropygial gland or sebaceous preening gland found at the dorsal base of the
tail This gland is an essential to preening a virtually continuous activity in most birds because it produces an
oily substance that birds use to help waterproof their feathers as well as keep them flexible for flight A number
