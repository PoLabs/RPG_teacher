Let us all slip into our beds and be there when she comes in just
as if we had never been away
And so when Mrs Darling went back to the nightnursery to see if
her husband was asleep all the beds were occupied The children
waited for her cry of joy but it did not come She saw them but she
did not believe they were there You see she saw them in their beds
so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream
hanging around her still
She sat down in the chair by the fire where in the old days she had
nursed them
They could not understand this and a cold fear fell upon all the
three of them
Mother Wendy cried
Thats Wendy she said but still she was sure it was the dream
Mother
Thats John she said
Mother cried Michael He knew her now
Thats Michael she said and she stretched out her arms for the
three little selfish children they would never envelop again Yes they
did they went round Wendy and John and Michael who had slipped
out of bed and run to her
George George she cried when she could speak and Mr
Darling woke to share her bliss and Nana came rushing in There
could not have been a lovelier sight but there was none to see it
except a little boy who was staring in at the window He had had
ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know but he was
looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be
for ever barred
