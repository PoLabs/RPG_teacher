42 SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND WELFARE
489
The dawn of the twentieth century was marked by anxieties about declining 
fertility and the health of babies and children As a consequence efforts to 
improve the birth rate as well as the health of infants and children took off in 
many European countries in the years leading up to the First World War These 
discussions were shaped by war driven by concerns about past defeats and 
potential future defeats In France these debates originated in the aftermath 
of an embarrassing loss in the FrancoPrussian War in 18701871 while in 
Britain they were influenced by dissatisfaction with British performance in 
the Boer War in South Africa in 1902 Meanwhile observers during this period 
took increasing notice of high and in some places rising infant mortality 
rates For example the last quarter of the nineteenth century in Britain saw 
a decline in the adult death rate but an increase in infant deaths These 
considerations contributed to new questions about how to engineer society 
through reproduction and the familyand one answer to that question was 
eugenics 
Against a backdrop of centuries of continental European warfare and 
increasing military skirmishes in imperial outposts alongside worrying 
statistics about stagnant or even growing infant mortality rates policy 
proposals for infant milk dispensaries to combat potential illness from 
exposure to unsanitary or insufficient food and water for babies and family 
allowances gained support across the political spectrum Encouraging and 
protecting the family became an issue for both rightwing nationalists keen to 
pursue national glory through a high birth rate and healthy military recruits 
and also feminists who sought to assist mothers and their children This trend 
could be seen for example in the work of feminists like Eleanor Rathbone in 
the United Kingdom who campaigned for family allowances for over twenty 
years until they were ultimately introduced in 1945 They could also be seen in 
initiatives like Frances Mdaille de la Famille franaise Adolf Hitlers Mothers 
Cross programme 1938 and the Soviet Order of Maternal Glory 1944 which 
were introduced to encourage women to have more children These initiatives 
were all based to a certain extent in eugenicsthe children of these families 
needed not only to be plentiful but also to be raised well 
After the Second World War the language and some of the policies related 
to the family and reproduction were necessarily restrained by a backlash 
against the kind of eugenics associated with Nazi Germany However state
run policies on the family and reproduction continued to play a large role 
and were even expanded Postwar concerns about problem families and 
troubled youths meant that in Great Britain social work and interventions 
into a growing number of single mother households became more widespread 
Meanwhile growing numbers of women in the workforce both during the war 
and in the decades afterward led to an expansion of publicly funded education 
and childcare as well as the expansion of maternity and later parental leave
