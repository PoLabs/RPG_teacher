heartland or as cleaners or domestic servants in the quickly expanding service 
economy of NorthWestern Europe These mass migrations contributed to 
the depopulation of poorer regions in Southern Europea loss which was 
compensated by the very substantial remittances sent back home These 
savings as well as the temporary residence permits for these guest workers 
underlined the expectation both of the labour migrants and the host societies 
that the former would return home to enjoy the fruits of their labour once the 
work was done 
But while their position in the host countries remained provisionalin 
terms of political and social rights housing social support education and 
cultural integrationthe duration of their stays lengthened because of the 
lack of prospects in their homelands but also because the demand for labour 
only grew leading to the attraction of workers from other countries notably 
Morocco and Turkey The governments and sometimes also members of the 
indigenous population of their new homelands were however illprepared 
and sometimes outright hostile to the idea of integrating these newcomers on 
a more permanent basis In this respect the position of guest workers started 
to resemble that of the second type of immigrant in postwar Europe those 
people within colonial empires
PostColonial Migration
Colonial rulers in the first half of the twentieth century had experimented 
with a variety of halfway modes of citizenship The neocolonial arrangements 
emerging during the course of decolonisation continued these ambivalent 
forms of colonial citizenship as substantial numbers of formerly colonised 
people made their way to the imperial centres of power via family ties labour 
migration or as refugees They contributed to the creation of a multiethnic 
European society whichdue to their failure to acknowledge the violence 
involved in its ethnic homogeneitymany Europeans found hard to accept
In the postimperial societies of Great Britain France Belgium the 
Netherlands and Portugal immigration from former colonies became a major 
phenomenon in the last third of the twentieth century It occurred at the same 
time as empires were breaking up and contributed to a recomposition of 
societies in NorthWestern Europe This type of migration is part of the long 
history of exchange between colony and metropole which gives it a particular 
chronology and certain characteristics 
At the beginning of the twentieth century the presence of populations 
originating from the colonies was minimal in the imperial metropoles 
Migration between metropoles and colonies had typically worked the other way
