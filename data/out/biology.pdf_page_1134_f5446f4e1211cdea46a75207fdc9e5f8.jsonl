Smell and Taste in the Brain
Olfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin unmyelinated axons The
olfactory bulb is composed of neural clusters called glomeruli and each glomerulus receives signals from
one type of olfactory receptor so each glomerulus is specific to one odorant From glomeruli olfactory signals
travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus Recall that this is a
different path from most other sensory information which is sent directly to the thalamus before ending up in the
cortex Olfactory signals also travel directly to the amygdala thereafter reaching the hypothalamus thalamus
and frontal cortex The last structure that olfactory signals directly travel to is a cortical center in the temporal
lobe structure important in spatial autobiographical declarative and episodic memories Olfaction is finally
processed by areas of the brain that deal with memory emotions reproduction and thought
Taste neurons project from taste cells in the tongue esophagus and palate to the medulla in the brainstem
From the medulla taste signals travel to the thalamus and then to the primary gustatory cortex Information from
different regions of the tongue is segregated in the medulla thalamus and cortex
364  Hearing and Vestibular Sensation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the relationship of amplitude and frequency of a sound wave to attributes of sound

Trace the path of sound through the auditory system to the site of transduction of sound

Identify the structures of the vestibular system that respond to gravity
Audition or hearing is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions It enables an
organism to detect and receive information about danger such as an approaching predator and to participate
in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating On the other hand although it is physically
linked to the auditory system the vestibular system is not involved in hearing Instead an animals vestibular
system detects its own movement both linear and angular acceleration and deceleration and balance
Sound
Auditory stimuli are sound waves which are mechanical pressure waves that move through a medium such as
air or water There are no sound waves in a vacuum since there are no air molecules to move in waves The
speed of sound waves differs based on altitude temperature and medium but at sea level and a temperature
of 20 C 68 F sound waves travel in the air at about 343 meters per second
As is true for all waves there are four main characteristics of a sound wave frequency wavelength period and
amplitude Frequency is the number of waves per unit of time and in sound is heard as pitch Highfrequency
15000Hz sounds are higherpitched short wavelength than lowfrequency long wavelengths 100Hz
sounds Frequency is measured in cycles per second and for sound the most commonly used unit is hertz Hz
or cycles per second Most humans can perceive sounds with frequencies between 30 and 20000 Hz Women
are typically better at hearing high frequencies but everyones ability to hear high frequencies decreases with
age Dogs detect up to about 40000 Hz cats 60000 Hz bats 100000 Hz and dolphins 150000 Hz and
American shad Alosa sapidissima a fish can hear 180000 Hz Those frequencies above the human range
are called ultrasound
Amplitude or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated
in Figure 3612 The sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds For
sound volume is measured in decibels dB The softest sound that a human can hear is the zero point Humans
speak normally at 60 decibels
