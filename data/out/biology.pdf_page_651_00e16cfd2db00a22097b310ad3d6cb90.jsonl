Archaeplastida
Molecular evidence supports the hypothesis that all Archaeplastida are descendents of an endosymbiotic
relationship between a heterotrophic protist and a cyanobacterium The protist members of the group include
the red algae and green algae It was from a common ancestor of these protists that the land plants evolved
since their closest relatives are found in this group The red and green algae include unicellular multicellular
and colonial forms A variety of algal life cycles exists but the most complex is alternation of generations in
which both haploid and diploid stages are multicellular A diploid sporophyte contains cells that undergo meiosis
to produce haploid spores The spores germinate and grow into a haploid gametophyte which then makes
gametes by mitosis The gametes fuse to form a zygote that grows into a diploid sporophyte Alternation of
generations is seen in some species of Archaeplastid algae as well as some species of Stramenopiles Figure
2310 In some species the gametophyte and sporophyte look quite different while in others they are nearly
indistinguishable
Glaucophytes
Glaucophytes are a small group of Archaeplastida interesting because their chloroplasts retain remnants of the
peptidoglycan cell wall of the ancestral cyanobacterial endosymbiont Figure 2310

Red Algae
Red algae or rhodophytes lack flagella and are primarily multicellular although they range in size from
microscopic unicellular protists to large multicellular forms grouped into the informal seaweed category Red
algae have a second cell wall outside an inner cellulose cell wall Carbohydrates in this wall are the source of
agarose used for electrophoresis gels and agar for solidifying bacterial media The red in the red algae comes
from phycoerythrins accessory photopigments that are red in color and obscure the green tint of chlorophyll in
some species Other protists classified as red algae lack phycoerythrins and are parasites Both the red algae
and the glaucophytes store carbohydrates in the cytoplasm rather than in the plastid Red algae are common
in tropical waters where they have been detected at depths of 260 meters Other red algae exist in terrestrial
or freshwater environments The red algae life cycle is an unusual alternation of generations that includes two
sporophyte phases with meiosis occurring only in the second sporophyte
