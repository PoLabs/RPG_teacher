however many adventures which she knew to be true because she
was in them herself and there were still more that were at least
partly true for the other boys were in them and said they were
wholly true To describe them all would require a book as large as an
EnglishLatin LatinEnglish Dictionary and the most we can do is
to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island The
difficulty is which one to choose Should we take the brush with the
redskins at Slightly Gulch It was a sanguinary affair and especially
interesting as showing one of Peters peculiarities which was that in
the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides At the Gulch
when victory was still in the balance sometimes leaning this way
and sometimes that he called out Im redskin today what are you
Tootles And Tootles answered Redskin what are you Nibs
and Nibs said Redskin what are you Twin and so on and they
were all redskins and of course this would have ended the fight had
not the real redskins fascinated by Peters methods agreed to be lost
boys for that once and so at it they all went again more fiercely than
ever
The extraordinary upshot of this adventure wasbut we have not
decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate Perhaps a
better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house
under the ground when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and
had to be pulled out like corks Or we might tell how Peter saved
Tiger Lilys life in the Mermaids Lagoon and so made her his ally
Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys
might eat it and perish and how they placed it in one cunning spot
after another but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her
children so that in time it lost its succulence and became as hard as
a stone and was used as a missile and Hook fell over it in the dark
Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peters friends
particularly of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the
lagoon and how the nest fell into the water and still the bird sat on
her eggs and Peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed That
is a pretty story and the end shows how grateful a bird can be but if
we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon which
would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one A
shorter adventure and quite as exciting was Tinker Bells attempt
with the help of some street fairies to have the sleeping Wendy
conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland Fortunately the
leaf gave way and Wendy woke thinking it was bathtime and swam
back Or again we might choose Peters defiance of the lions when
he drew a circle round him on the ground with an arrow and dared
them to cross it and though he waited for hours with the other boys
and Wendy looking on breathlessly from trees not one of them dared
to accept his challenge
Which of these adventures shall we choose The best way will be
to toss for it
I have tossed and the lagoon has won This almost makes one
wish that the gulch or the cake or Tinks leaf had won Of course I
could do it again and make it best out of three however perhaps
fairest to stick to the lagoon
