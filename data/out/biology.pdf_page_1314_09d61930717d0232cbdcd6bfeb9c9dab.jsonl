Cytokine Release Effect
The binding of PRRs with PAMPs triggers the release of cytokines which signal that a pathogen is present and
needs to be destroyed along with any infected cells A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell
differentiation form and function proliferation production and gene expression to affect immune responses
At least 40 types of cytokines exist in humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them the cell type
that responds to them and the changes they produce One type of cytokine interferon is illustrated in Figure
424
One subclass of cytokines is the interleukin IL so named because they mediate interactions between
leukocytes white blood cells Interleukins are involved in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses
In addition to being released from cells after PAMP recognition cytokines are released by the infected cells
which bind to nearby uninfected cells and induce those cells to release cytokines which results in a cytokine
burst
A second class of earlyacting cytokines is interferons which are released by infected cells as a warning to
nearby uninfected cells One of the functions of an interferon is to inhibit viral replication They also have
other important functions such as tumor surveillance Interferons work by signaling neighboring uninfected
cells to destroy RNA and reduce protein synthesis signaling neighboring infected cells to undergo apoptosis
programmed cell death and activating immune cells
In response to interferons uninfected cells alter their gene expression which increases the cells resistance to
infection One effect of interferoninduced gene expression is a sharply reduced cellular protein synthesis Virally
infected cells produce more viruses by synthesizing large quantities of viral proteins Thus by reducing protein
synthesis a cell becomes resistant to viral infection
