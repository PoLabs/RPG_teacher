Dont talk to yerself said Tom But if you wants to sit on the last one sit
on him Which is he
The one with the yellow stockings said Bert
Nonsense the one with the grey stockings said a voice like Williams
I made sure it was yellow said Bert
Yellow it was said William
Then what did yer say it was grey for said Bert
I never did Tom said it
That I never did said Tom It was you
Two to one so shut yer mouth said Bert
Who are you atalkin to said William
Now stop it said Tom and Bert together The nights gettin on and dawn
comes early Lets get on with it
Dawn take you all and be stone to you said a voice that sounded like
Williams But it wasnt For just at that moment the light came over the hill and
there was a mighty twitter in the branches William never spoke for he stood
turned to stone as he stooped and Bert and Tom were stuck like rocks as they
looked at him And there they stand to this day all alone unless the birds perch
on them for trolls as you probably know must be underground before dawn or
they go back to the stuff of the mountains they are made of and never move
again That is what had happened to Bert and Tom and William
Excellent said Gandalf as he stepped from behind a tree and helped Bilbo
to climb down out of a thornbush Then Bilbo understood It was the wizards
voice that had kept the trolls bickering and quarrelling until the light came and
made an end of them
The next thing was to untie the sacks and let out the dwarves They were
nearly suffocated and very annoyed they had not at all enjoyed lying there
listening to the trolls making plans for roasting them and squashing them and
mincing them They had to hear Bilbos account of what had happened to him
twice over before they were satisfied
Silly time to go practising pinching and pocketpicking said Bombur
when what we wanted was fire and food
And thats just what you wouldnt have got of those fellows without a
struggle in any case said Gandalf Anyhow you are wasting time now Dont
you realize that the trolls must have a cave or a hole dug somewhere near to hide
from the sun in We must look into it
They searched about and soon found the marks of trolls stony boots going
