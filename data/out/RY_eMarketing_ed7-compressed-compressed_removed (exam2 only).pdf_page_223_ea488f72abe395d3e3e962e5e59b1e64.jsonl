What you should be interested in is what activity takes place based on a message This means 
youll need to track leads or actions You can do this through link tagging meaning appending 
tracking parameters to a URL in your newsletter or SMS These parameters are then identified by 
the Google Analytics of your website registering that the user has come to the site through your 
email or SMS Google Analytics will then take the information in the tag and store it in a cookie 
from which it can track the users interactions with the site after they arrived at the landing page

These can then be used to report on traffic from that message using Google Analytics 
Generic direct messaging benchmarks can be used as a guide to see how well your campaigns 
are performing but the best way to monitor performance is to benchmark your own campaign 
Smaller lists tend to have a higher open rate but this is probably because theyre more 
targeted The overall average email open rate is 274 though this varies by industry while the 
average clickthrough rate is 45 Overall rates are quite low because far too many ignorant 
or lazy email marketers bring down the average Its best to look at the average open rate for 
your industry rather than the overall rates You can do this by checking the Email Stat Centre 
website EmailStatCenter nd 
The overall SMS open rate is harder to determine Many reports put it at between 82 and 
98 but this is difficult to ascertain The average clickthrough rate varies by source but is 
generally far higher than email at anywhere between 6 and 19 with overall response rates

Once the reports have been generated it is time to work out what the numbers are revealing 
and use this information to improve the next message to be sent out 
To make sure that your email marketing efforts are continually improvingits important to 
test your campaigns The most common form of direct marketing testing is to conduct an 
AB split test This is a test that involves sending one version of your newsletter or SMS to a 
specified percentage of your database while sending a modified version to the remainder of 
your database Some factors to test include 
	
Open and response rates across different subject lines calls to action and delivery times 
	
Optimal number of links in an email for clickthrough rates and conversions
