Although multidirectional contacts proliferated between many different 
regions of the world during this period it was the American continent that 
Europeans found particularly alien in relation to their existing frameworks 
This feeling of surprise and astonishment together with the intellectual 
impact produced by the materialisationin European eyesof an entirely 
new continent populated by human beings previously unmentioned in 
classical and medieval sources is not comparable to encounters with other 
parts of the globe Since antiquity Europeans had cultivated knowledge of 
Africa extending far beyond the southern shores of the Mediterranean even if 
it was incomplete and distorted Interaction with different parts of Asia dated 
back millennia The fifth austral continent was hypothesised and imagined

eighteenth century meaning it did not provoke a shock comparable to the 
apparition of America in the European imagination
Complexities and Ambivalences
The title of this chapter refers to the process of constructing boundaries and 
defining the external The other therefore is not a fixed category but rather a 
malleable and complex relationship which could be invoked in various ways 
at different times and for different ends Accordingly the appreciation of 
others in European sources was very unstable undergoing marked shifts in 
accordance with the motives and interests of the authors in question the areas

general views the media and channels of dissemination and the contexts in 
which such descriptions were produced 
The Ottoman Empire early modern Europes nearest other and with its 
extensive territories in SouthEastern and Central Europe a major actor in 
the continents history is a case in point From the fourteenth century to the 
mideighteenth the Ottomans presented a formidable military challenge 
conquering among others large parts of the Kingdom of Hungary In contrast 
to the majority of its population the empires ruling elite was Muslim 
meaning that Christian Europeans viewed them as both military and religious 
adversaries At the same time European travellers diplomats military thinkers 
and even political theorists like the French Jean Bodin 15301596 frequently 
admired the social political and administrative organisation of the Ottoman 
Empire as well as its military discipline Many European polities maintained 
peaceful relations with the Ottomans or even forged alliances with them The 
kings of France famously did so in the sixteenth century in an attempt to curb 
the power of Europes other powerful dynasty the House of Habsburg By the 
turn of the eighteenth century the fear and awe that had dominated European
