The idea of bringing art and life closer together was evident in small artistic 
vanguard groups connected to the fringes of the socalled New Left like 
the Situationists in France or the Provos in the Netherlands intellectual 
and activist circles which promoted dtournement and subversion as central 
elements of their artistic explorations aiming at restructuring life in the city 
and ultimately transforming everyday life Artistic creation was informed by 
the repertory of feast play poetry and the liberation of speech while its 
language was inspired by Marx Freud Nietzsche Dadaism and Surrealism 
In terms of film which increasingly gained territory as an artistic medium in 
society after the Second World War there was a neoavantgarde tendency 
directly inspired by the tradition of the 1920s and 1930s
The concept of the underground was part and parcel of the avantgardes 
of the 1950s and 1960s and directly linked to the writers of the socalled Beat 
Generation in the United States It was associated with an alternative lifestyle 
that characterised itself through nonconformity and participation in socalled 
countercultures such as the hippies which contested the established ways

This dialectic between playfulness and seriousness engag political action and 
everyday iconoclasm illustrates the dichotomies but also the pastiche and 
hybrid character of the 1960s artistic movements Communitarianism as a 
lifestyle choice of the 1960s was a byproduct of this This phenomenon included 
rural hippy communes more politicised communes like Kommune 1 in West 
Berlin or more experimental or artistically transgressive ones such as the 
Friedrichshof Commune founded by Austrian artist Otto Mhl Inspiration 
for many of these communes whether implicitly or explicitly often came from 
earlier twentiethcentury traditions Consequently earlier communitarian 
ideas for example those of the German anarchist Gustav Landauer regained 
popularity in the 1960s
In Eastern Europe the rise of the neoavantgarde had a lot to do with 
realising and formulating individual needs and rights as opposed to the 
compulsory and permanently declaimed priority of community interests 
Socialist ideology according to this section of the neoavantgarde was the 
oppression of any kind of individual way of thinking looking or behaving 
Being equal meant uniformity in everyday life Although a critique of
