It wasnt Mrs Norris It was Neville He was curled up on the floor
fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer
Thank goodness you found me Ive been out here for hours I couldnt
remember the new password to get in to bed
Keep your voice down Neville The passwords Pig snout but it wont
help you now the Fat Ladys gone off somewhere
Hows your arm said Harry
Fine said Neville showing them Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a
minute
Good  well look Neville weve got to be somewhere well see you
later 
Dont leave me said Neville scrambling to his feet I dont want to
stay here alone the Bloody Barons been past twice already
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and
Neville
If either of you get us caught Ill never rest until Ive learned that
Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about and used it on you
Hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the
Curse of the Bogies but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned
them all forward
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the
high windows At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs
Norris but they were lucky They sped up a staircase to the third floor
and tiptoed toward the trophy room
Malfoy and Crabbe werent there yet The crystal trophy cases glimmered
where the moonlight caught them Cups shields plates and statues
winked silver and gold in the darkness They edged along the walls
keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room Harry took
out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once The minutes
crept by
