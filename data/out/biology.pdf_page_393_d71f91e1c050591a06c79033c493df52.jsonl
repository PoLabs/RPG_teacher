of the same individual or between individuals of the same species He also discovered something unexpected
That the amount of adenine equaled the amount of thymine and the amount of cytosine equaled the amount
of guanine that is A  T and G  C Different species had equal amounts of purines AG and pyrimidines
T  C but different ratios of AT to GC These observations became known as Chargaffs rules Chargaffs
findings proved immensely useful when Watson and Crick were getting ready to propose their DNA double helix
model You can see after reading the past few pages how science builds upon previous discoveries sometimes
in a slow and laborious process
142  DNA Structure and Sequencing
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the structure of DNA

Explain the Sanger method of DNA sequencing

Discuss the similarities and differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA
The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides The important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous
nitrogenbearing base a 5carbon sugar pentose and a phosphate group Figure 145 The nucleotide is
named depending on the nitrogenous base The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine A and
guanine G or a pyrimidine such as cytosine C and thymine T
Figure 145 The purines have a double ring structure with a sixmembered ring fused to a fivemembered ring
Pyrimidines are smaller in size they have a single sixmembered ring structure
The images above illustrate the five bases of DNA and RNA Examine the images and explain why these
are called nitrogenous bases How are the purines different from the pyrimidines How is one purine
or pyrimidine different from another eg adenine from guanine How is a nucleoside different from a
nucleotide
The purines have a double ring structure with a sixmembered ring fused to a fivemembered ring
Pyrimidines are smaller in size they have a single sixmembered ring structure
The sugar is deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA The carbon atoms of the fivecarbon sugar are
numbered 1 2 3 4 and 5 1 is read as one prime The phosphate which makes DNA and RNA acidic
is connected to the 5 carbon of the sugar by the formation of an ester linkage between phosphoric acid
and the 5OH group an ester is an acid  an alcohol In DNA nucleotides the 3 carbon of the sugar
deoxyribose is attached to a hydroxyl OH group In RNA nucleotides the 2 carbon of the sugar ribose
also contains a hydroxyl group The base is attached to the 1carbon of the sugar
