Paleontologist
Natural history museums contain the fossils of extinct animals as well as information about how these
animals evolved lived and died Paleontologists are scientists who study prehistoric life They use fossils
to observe and explain how life evolved on Earth and how species interacted with each other and with
the environment A paleontologist needs to be knowledgeable in mathematics biology ecology chemistry
geology and many other scientific disciplines A paleontologists work may involve field studies searching
for and studying fossils In addition to digging for and finding fossils paleontologists also prepare fossils
for further study and analysis Although dinosaurs are probably the first animals that come to mind when
thinking about ancient life paleontologists study a variety of life forms from plants fungi and invertebrates
to the vertebrate fishes amphibians reptiles birds and mammals
An undergraduate degree in earth science or biology is a good place to start toward the career path of
becoming a paleontologist Most often a graduate degree is necessary Additionally work experience in a
museum or in a paleontology lab is useful
