Introduction 
The twentieth century witnessed a number of significant external pressures 
on populations across Europe from two World Wars and an economic 
crash between them to the Cold War the crumbling of colonial empires 
and the fall of the Iron Curtain Against this backdrop there were major 
reconfigurations of the urban landscape and the experiences of work social 
class and gender relations Meanwhile new research alongside increasing 
academic and professional specialisation contributed to greater knowledge 
about social problems and generated innovative policy ideas to tackle them 
These transformations intersected with broader trends in thinking about the 
role of the state in an era that many saw as modern What were the problems 
of modernity and would they require new social policies Would they 
require the creation of what came to be knownsometimes derisivelyas 
the welfare state To what extent were these interventions attempts at social 
engineering
The tone and extent of statedriven interventions in the social sphere
interventions in the workplace in the family and reproduction and in 
individuals health and wellbeingincreased greatly over the twentieth 
century In part the increase in activity stemmed from the rise of new political 
ideologies and concomitant social and political experiments under fascism 
National Socialism communism and liberal social democracy each of which 
sought to carve out its own ideal of modern life Yet it was also the growing 
capacity of European states to intervene as well as increasing information 
and expertise that may have proved most significant for this transformation
