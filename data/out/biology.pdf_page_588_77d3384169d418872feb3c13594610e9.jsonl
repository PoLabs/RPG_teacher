Figure 2116 Life cycle of HIV HIV an enveloped icosahedral virus attaches to the CD4 receptor of an immune cell
and fuses with the cell membrane Viral contents are released into the cell where viral enzymes convert the single
stranded RNA genome into DNA and incorporate it into the host genome credit NIAID NIH
Unfortunately when any of these drugs are used individually the high mutation rate of the virus allows it to easily
and rapidly develop resistance to the drug limiting the drugs effectiveness The breakthrough in the treatment
of HIV was the development of HAART highly active antiretroviral therapy which involves a mixture of different
drugs sometimes called a drug cocktail By attacking the virus at different stages of its replicative cycle it is
much more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to multiple drugs at the same time Still even with the
use of combination HAART therapy there is concern that over time the virus will develop resistance to this
therapy Thus new antiHIV drugs are constantly being developed with the hope of continuing the battle against
this highly fatal virus
