the arms or legs laterally to lift them straight out to the side Adduction is the movement of a bone toward the
midline of the body Movement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction Circumduction
is the movement of a limb in a circular motion as in moving the arm in a circular motion
Rotational Movement
Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its longitudinal axis Rotation can be
toward the midline of the body which is referred to as medial rotation or away from the midline of the body
which is referred to as lateral rotation Movement of the head from side to side is an example of rotation
Special Movements
Some movements that cannot be classified as gliding angular or rotational are called special movements
Inversion involves the soles of the feet moving inward toward the midline of the body Eversion is the opposite
of inversion movement of the sole of the foot outward away from the midline of the body Protraction is the
anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane Retraction occurs as a joint moves back into position
after protraction Protraction and retraction can be seen in the movement of the mandible as the jaw is thrust
outwards and then back inwards Elevation is the movement of a bone upward such as when the shoulders are
shrugged lifting the scapulae Depression is the opposite of elevationmovement downward of a bone such
as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position
Dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee Plantar flexion is a bending
at the ankle when the heel is lifted such as when standing on the toes Supination is the movement of the
radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward Pronation is the opposite movement in
which the palm faces backward Opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand
making it possible to grasp and hold objects
Types of Synovial Joints
Synovial joints are further classified into six different categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the
joint The shape of the joint affects the type of movement permitted by the joint Figure 3826 These joints can
be described as planar hinge pivot condyloid saddle or ballandsocket joints
