universal suffrage Guizot simply replied enrich yourselves through hard

Meanwhile in Britain nineteenthcentury liberalism took the path of 
radicalism under the name of utilitarianism Its leading representatives were 
Jeremy Bentham 17481832 and John Stuart Mill 18061873 Utilitarianism 
left behind the doctrine of natural law and focused on the social utility of 
individual rights Bentham conceived of the legislator as a social reformer 
whose aim should be to achieve the greatest happiness for the greatest 
number harmonising individual interests and the common good even if the 
latter was understood as the sum of those individual interests He believed 
that happiness was calculable in terms of empirical pleasures material well
being and the concrete aspirations of individuals The result would be a 
pluralistic society in which individuals act rationally and know what is best 
for themselves hence the advocacy of universal suffrage under a neutral 
state that allows them freedom of action To limit any abuse of power by the 
state he added the idea of annual elections as well as other radical ideas such 
as the abolition of the monarchy and the House of Lords the importance of 
education equality of the sexes and animal rights Mill for his part critical of 
the utilitarianism of his elders responded that happiness was not quantifiable 
and introduced social aspects into his economic liberalism an interventionist 
state without renouncing private property or the free market that would not 
abandon the weakest members of society Mill was a convinced feminist
much of his work was written jointly with his partner Harriet Taylor Mill 
18071858and critical of the principle of selfishness His defence of freedom 
and individuality was nevertheless radical sovereignty of the individual over 
his body his life and his conscience was inalienable and he reclaimed the 
right to dissent To this end he introduced the principles of proportionality in 
legislative representation which would also represent minorities along with 
pluralism and weighted voting seeking to unite the idea of universal suffrage 
with that of the social quality of individuals based on education and merit 
While Bentham Mill and Taylor were staunch defenders of universal 
suffrage including the vote for women other liberals were much more 
hesitant about this This was the case for instance with the French liberal 
Alexis de Tocqueville 18051859 Having grown up in an aristocratic family 
repressed by the revolution Tocqueville travelled on a government mission to 
the United States in 1831 where his impressions of political life inspired him 
to write his most famous book published in two volumes between 1835 and 
1840 Democracy in America More than a political system based on popular 
sovereignty democracy was for Tocqueville a society in which all perceive 
each other as equals He acknowledged that the democratic revolution was 
an irresistible force yet he was concerned about the place of liberty in a society
