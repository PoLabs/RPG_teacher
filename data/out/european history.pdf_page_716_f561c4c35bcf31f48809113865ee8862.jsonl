a land of almost uncontested Catholicism but the political fragmentation of 
the Germanic area was coupled with a religious fragmentation by virtue of the 
cuius regio eius religio whose realm their religion principle that prevailed 
at the time of the Peace of Augsburg 1555 France after almost forty years of 
civil war 15621598 remained Catholic but with a large Reformed minority 
The former Netherlands which rose up against its Iberian ruler in the Eighty 
Years War 15681648 was split between a South that finally returned to 
Catholicism and a North dominated by Calvinism but where Catholics and 
Lutherans remained numerous England after the Henrician Schism 1534 
hesitated and then followed its own path that of an Anglicanism inspired by 
Calvinist theology but with an ecclesial organisation close to Catholicism The 
Iberian Peninsula less sensitive to Protestant ideas reinforced its Catholic 
exclusivism by expelling or forcibly converting its Jewish and Muslim 
populations 14921525 then by expelling in 1609 these new Christians many 
of whom had remained clandestinely faithful to the faith of their ancestors
To analyse the reactions of populations to this new religious situation 
historians have used the concept of confessionalisation This concept originated 
in the work of Ernst Walter Zeeden on the constitution of confessional 
identity Konfessionsbildung in the Holy Roman Empire In the 1960s the 
German historian showed that the rivalry between Catholic and Protestant 
confessions had contributed to shaping the institutional and social realities of 
the various states and cities of the empire and to differentiating them through 
the construction of antagonistic identities Catholic Lutheran and Calvinist 
spaces emerged and defined themselves in opposition to each other in 
increasingly exclusive and intolerant ways In the following decades Zeedens 
interpretative scheme was developed further and granted a key role to political 
powers and elites These elites acquired thanks to the Peace of Augsburg the 
power to impose their religious choices on the population Consequently 
from the 1560s onwards states and churches would subject the population 
to social discipline Sozialdisziplinierung by means of a series of acculturating 
mechanisms geared towards inculcating the faithful with the norms of their 
rulers Through an intense catechetical effort and increased surveillance of 
morals the civil and ecclesiastical authorities thus turned believers steeped 
in superstition into true Catholics Lutherans or Calvinists Over the last 
thirty years historical research has nevertheless nuanced this schema by 
reducing the weight of the authorities in this process and by acknowledging 
that ordinary folk had a measure of agency and choice In particular the 
involvement of communities of believers in the surveillance of morals and 
dogmatic abuses has been reevaluated emphasising the role played in this 
respect by Protestant consistories or Catholic brotherhoods and highlighting 
the demand for repression from the population
