minds of citizens and foreigners To this end institutions integrated the states 
population and territory and were capable of demarcating and stabilising 
spatial and mental borders visvis adjacent states
One of these institutions was the written constitution In the nineteenth 
century constitutions reshaped the legal framework and placed limits on 
state power throughout Europe They were based on principles like national 
or popular sovereignty a liberal vision of civil and political rights and the 
separation of powers executive judicial and legislative Legislative power 
lay in elected assemblies which now represented national sovereignty and 
were no longer separated into estates as in medieval or early modern times 
Thus the ideal of the nation as a community of equals promised political 
participation for all citizens In practice this meant a suffrage that as the century 
progressed expanded to include more parts of the national population
Constitutions guaranteed the fundamental rights of every citizen and 
regulated the basic rules of political and social life within a state by abolishing 
privileges based on birth and securing equality before the law and the right to 
property Constitutional movements emerged all over the continent In May 
1791 the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth was the first state in Europe to 
adopt a constitution four months before revolutionary France did the same In 
the course of the nineteenth century almost all European states followed their 
lead By the eve of the First World War only the autocratic Tsardom of Russia 
and the Grand Duchy of MecklenburgSchwerin a small territory within the 
German Empire had not adopted a modern constitution
We should not underestimate the institution of the monarchy Fundamentally 
contested by the idea of popular sovereignty and the principle of equality the 
monarchy was forced to produce proof of its superiority over competing forms 
of government The survival of the monarchy depended on the efficiency and 
performance of its leaders France for instance changed from monarchy to 
republic and vice versa several times Overall many monarchs had to abdicate 
from the throne as a result of revolts or revolutions
Still with the exclusion of France European monarchies and their dynasties 
were anchors of stability in a century of dynamic change In unification 
processes like those of Italy and Germany monarchs took the lead Piedmonts 
Vittorio Emanuele II and Prussias Wilhelm I claimed to be acting as leaders 
of the newly unified nation Dynasties that tied themselves to the new ideas 
of the nation such as the royal houses of Great Britain Denmark and the 
Netherlands also succeeded in acquiring a popular basis that enlarged their 
stature and informal power Many more of the new nationstates that appeared 
in Europe during the long nineteenth century chose the monarchy as the form 
of government Belgium in 1830 Leopold I Greece in 1832 Otto I Romania 
in 185966 Alexandru Ioan Cuza Carol I and Norway in 1905 Haakon VII
