its differing chemical properties and its function in living organisms
A functional group can participate in specific chemical reactions Figure 227 shows some of the important
functional groups in biological molecules They include hydroxyl methyl carbonyl carboxyl amino phosphate
and sulfhydryl These groups play an important role in forming molecules like DNA proteins carbohydrates and
lipids We usually classify functional groups as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity
characteristics An example of a hydrophobic group is the nonpolar methyl molecule Among the hydrophilic
functional groups is the carboxyl group in amino acids some amino acid side chains and the fatty acids that
form triglycerides and phospholipids This carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions H from the COOH
group resulting in the negatively charged COO group This contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever
molecule on which it is found Other functional groups such as the carbonyl group have a partially negatively
charged oxygen atom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules again making the molecule more
hydrophilic
Figure 227 These functional groups are in many different biological molecules R also known as Rgroup is an
abbreviation for any group in which a carbon or hydrogen atom is attached to the rest of the molecule
Hydrogen bonds between functional groups within the same molecule or between different molecules are
important to the function of many macromolecules and help them to fold properly into and maintain the
appropriate shape for functioning Hydrogen bonds are also involved in various recognition processes such as
DNA complementary base pairing and the binding of an enzyme to its substrate as Figure 228 illustrates
