that evolved within similar environmental conditions When similar characteristics occur because of
environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship it is an analogy or homoplasy For
example insects use wings to fly like bats and birds but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely
different These are analogous structures Figure 208
Similar traits can be either homologous or analogous Homologous structures share a similar embryonic origin
Analogous organs have a similar function For example the bones in a whales front flipper are homologous to
the bones in the human arm These structures are not analogous A butterfly or birds wings are analogous but
not homologous Some structures are both analogous and homologous bird and bat wings are both homologous
and analogous Scientists must determine which type of similarity a feature exhibits to decipher the organisms

Figure 208 The c wing of a honeybee is similar in shape to a b bird wing and a bat wing and it serves the same
function However the honeybee wing is not composed of bones and has a distinctly different structure and embryonic
origin These wing types insect versus bat and bird illustrate an analogysimilar structures that do not share an

Molecular Comparisons
The advancement of DNA technology has given rise to molecular systematics which is use of molecular data
in taxonomy and biological geography biogeography New computer programs not only confirm many earlier
classified organisms but also uncover previously made errors As with physical characteristics even the DNA
sequence can be tricky to read in some cases For some situations two very closely related organisms can
appear unrelated if a mutation occurred that caused a shift in the genetic code Inserting or deleting a mutation
would move each nucleotide base over one place causing two similar codes to appear unrelated
Sometimes two segments of DNA code in distantly related organisms randomly share a high percentage of
