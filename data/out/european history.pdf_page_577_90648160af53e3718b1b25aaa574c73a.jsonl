systems had built their postwar legitimacy on progress placing largescale 
production and consumption at the centre of their parallel pursuits of improved 
standards of living However communist countries persisted for longer in 
emphasising heavy industry as the basis of broader economic development 
By the 1980s pollution of air water and soil in many countries had become 
dire As environmental protest developed in tandem with human rights and 
peace activism in that decade all three of these supposedly apolitical issues 
became important vehicles for criticising communist authorities
By the 1990s environmentalism had become a professionalised domain of 
protest Faced with government and industrybacked experts supportive of 
nuclear energy environmentalists developed their own counterexpertise 
contributing to the pluralisation popularisation and contestation of scientific 
knowledge in the late twentieth century In order to lobby for legislation on 
air pollution water quality and animal protection many activists banded 
together within nongovernmental organisations some of which were 
international eg Friends of the Earth Greenpeace In several countries they 
also formed political parties specifically focused on environmental issues 
While green parties have had mixed success in national elections in different 
countries they have been a persistent fixture of the European parliament since 
the end of the twentieth century
Conclusion
The twentieth century was one of enduring environmental crises most of 
them precipitated by industrialisation and modernisation To tackle these 
problems European societies pursued a range of different approaches 
from technological solutions and policy changes to scientific exchange and 
environmental activism By the end of the century the extent to which human 
activity had changed the environment was unmistakable It was no longer a 
question of whether the planets ecosystems might change but how much 
and how fast the problem of global warming that had been discussed as a 
preventable possibility in the 1970s and 1980s became a halfcentury later 
the reality of a climate change that could only be managed or mitigated 
The twentieth century witnessed what environmental historian JR McNeill 
has described as The Great Acceleration of human activities affecting the 
Earths climate biodiversity and ecosystems By the dawn of the twentyfirst 
century the public had begun to take notice that the world had entered a new 
geological era the Anthropocene was characterised not by an independently 
changing environment that shaped possibilities for living beings but by the 
ways in which human beings specifically changed their environment with 
consequences for all life on the planet
