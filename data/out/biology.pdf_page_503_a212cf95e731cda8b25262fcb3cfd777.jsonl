Figure 182 Darwin observed that beak shape varies among finch species He postulated that ancestral species beaks
had adapted over time to equip the finches to acquire different food sources
Wallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and they independently developed the
same explanation for how and why such changes could take place Darwin called this mechanism natural
selection Natural selection or survival of the fittest is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with
favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits This leads to evolutionary change
For example Darwin observed a population of giant tortoises in the Galpagos Archipelago to have longer necks
than those that lived on other islands with dry lowlands These tortoises were selected because they could
reach more leaves and access more food than those with short necks In times of drought when fewer leaves
would be available those that could reach more leaves had a better chance to eat and survive than those that
couldnt reach the food source Consequently longnecked tortoises would be more likely to be reproductively
successful and pass the longnecked trait to their offspring Over time only longnecked tortoises would be
present in the population
Natural selection Darwin argued was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature First
most characteristics of organisms are inherited or passed from parent to offspring Although no one including
Darwin and Wallace knew how this happened at the time it was a common understanding Second more
offspring are produced than are able to survive so resources for survival and reproduction are limited The
capacity for reproduction in all organisms outstrips the availability of resources to support their numbers Thus
there is competition for those resources in each generation Both Darwin and Wallaces understanding of this
principle came from reading economist Thomas Malthus essay that explained this principle in relation to human
populations Third offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those variations are
inherited Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics which allow them to best
compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are
less able to compete Because characteristics are inherited these traits will be better represented in the next
generation This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called descent with
modification Ultimately natural selection leads to greater adaptation of the population to its local environment
It is the only mechanism known for adaptive evolution
In 1858 Darwin and Wallace Figure 183 presented papers at the Linnean Society in London that discussed
the idea of natural selection The following year Darwins book On the Origin of Species was published His
book outlined in considerable detail his arguments for evolution by natural selection
