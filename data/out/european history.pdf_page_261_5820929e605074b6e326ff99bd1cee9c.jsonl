Introduction
At the dawn of the modern period European society continued to be 
structured by sharp inequalities some of them inherited from earlier periods 
and some of them new Many different hierarchies including those of class 
gender race and disability intersected and overlapped creating complex 
patterns of privilege and disadvantage throughout the nineteenth century and 
across Europe These forms of inequality were in some cases connected and 
interlocking As well as that they changed over time Here we tackle four main 
axes of inequality 1 class and economic inequality 2 gender and sexual 
inequality 3 forms of inequality supposedly justified by ideas about race 
religion and ethnicity and 4 those that were orientated around ideas about 
disability However whilst our structure is organised around these four areas 
of concern they neither cover all the forms of inequality present in nineteenth
century Europe nor should they be taken as discrete categories Issues of 
inequality in this period were as today profoundly relational 
Class and Economic Forms of Inequality 
Thanks to the collection and analysis of data by economist Thomas Piketty and 
his team of collaborators we know that at the end of the eighteenth century 
economic inequality was very high in Europe The nineteenth century saw 
liberal revolutions and diverse reforms that brought about the end of legal 
privileges in some European societies the end of serfdom where it existed 
in Central and Eastern Europe between 1848 and 1865 and that gradually 
opened social elites up to new groups almost everywhere Yet inequality
