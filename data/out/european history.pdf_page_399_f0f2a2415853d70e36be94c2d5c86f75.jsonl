Rage for Order in the Colonies
After 1815 the European powers turned their gaze again towards overseas 
territories and with more intensity Rather than fighting among themselves 
the European empires were far more inclined to cooperation working 
together in the fight against piracy slave trade and alsolateranarchism 
They invested in joint operationsa European military intervention in Syria 
or joint campaigns against piracy on the open waters Sea power was further 
developed to uphold the post1815 interimperial order Even though rivalries 
increased after this period the cooperative spirit in Europe continued to 
permeate and even propel the ongoing colonial and imperialist relationships 
with the nonEuropean world throughout the century
Ford and Benton offer a convincing explanation for this imperial 
cooperation after 1815 the rage for order of empires struggling not just 
with diverging military commercial and political interests but also with 
the increasing importance of private investors and stakeholders caused 
the stateled expansions to prioritise the juridification of colonial rule The 
rage for order was perhaps even more important as a driver for colonial 
expansion than open greed and exploitation The drive for legal reform that 
underpinned many expeditions and invasions in colonial backwaters cannot 
simply be explained by pointing to the liberal type of imperialism focusing 
on the advance of human rights civilisation or other types of benevolent 
reforms The mere presence of the post1815 states rather than their nonstate 
mercantile commercial predecessors in the colonial territories drove them to 
more bureaucracy more statelike procedures and institutions that needed to 
be established in order to settle commercial conflicts peacefully or to curtail 
petty despots that abused their power in faraway lands
Cooperation between states and largescale empires also led to the 
proliferation of treaties constitutions and agreements on dividing spheres 
of influence The Monroe Doctrine of 1822 issued by the US Administration 
and the Nanking Treaty between Britain and the Netherlands underscore this 
point these are our areas and we determine law and order hereno other 
interventions or incursions allowed
Wars of conquest in Asia Britain the Netherlands the Middle East 
France and Liberation Wars Americas were paired with counterinsurgency 
campaigns and an increase of civil wars in the wake of the nineteenth century
With industrial warfare European powers stepped up competition towards 
the end of the nineteenth century again The opening up exploitation and 
occupation of rivers in Africa for example led to the Conference of Berlin 
18841885 where the principle of effective occupation precipitated the 
course to military action against insubordinate colonial inhabitants These
