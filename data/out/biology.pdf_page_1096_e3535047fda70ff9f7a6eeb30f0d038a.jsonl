The entire brain contains only about 85 tablespoons of CSF but CSF is constantly produced in the ventricles
This creates a problem when a ventricle is blockedthe CSF builds up and creates swelling and the brain is
pushed against the skull This swelling condition is called hydrocephalus water head and can cause seizures
cognitive problems and even death if a shunt is not inserted to remove the fluid and pressure

Brain
The brain is the part of the central nervous system that is contained in the cranial cavity of the skull It includes
the cerebral cortex limbic system basal ganglia thalamus hypothalamus and cerebellum There are three
different ways that a brain can be sectioned in order to view internal structures a sagittal section cuts the brain
left to right as shown in Figure 3521b a coronal section cuts the brain front to back as shown in Figure 3520a
and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to bottom
Cerebral Cortex
The outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex which is
folded into hills called gyri singular gyrus and valleys called sulci singular sulcus The cortex is made up of
two hemispheresright and leftwhich are separated by a large sulcus A thick fiber bundle called the corpus
callosum Latin tough body connects the two hemispheres and allows information to be passed from one
side to the other Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the
other the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant In fact sometimes very rarely an entire
hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy While patients do suffer some deficits following the surgery
they can have surprisingly few problems especially when the surgery is performed on children who have very
immature nervous systems
