as the door was open just as if he had been invited
I see they have begun to arrive already he said when he caught sight of
Dwalins green hood hanging up He hung his red one next to it and Balin at
your service he said with his hand on his breast
Thank you said Bilbo with a gasp It was not the correct thing to say but
they have begun to arrive had flustered him badly He liked visitors but he liked
to know them before they arrived and he preferred to ask them himself He had
a horrible thought that the cakes might run short and then heas the host he
knew his duty and stuck to it however painfulhe might have to go without
Come along in and have some tea he managed to say after taking a deep
breath
A little beer would suit me better if it is all the same to you my good sir
said Balin with the white beard But I dont mind some cakeseedcake if you
have any
Lots Bilbo found himself answering to his own surprise and he found
himself scuttling off too to the cellar to fill a pint beermug and then to a
pantry to fetch two beautiful round seedcakes which he had baked that
afternoon for his aftersupper morsel
When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends
as a matter of fact they were brothers Bilbo plumped down the beer and the
cake in front of them when loud came a ring at the bell again and then another
ring
Gandalf for certain this time he thought as he puffed along the passage
But it was not It was two more dwarves both with blue hoods silver belts and
yellow beards and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade In they
hopped as soon as the door began to openBilbo was hardly surprised at all
What can I do for you my dwarves he said
Kili at your service said the one And Fili added the other and they
both swept off their blue hoods and bowed
At yours and your familys replied Bilbo remembering his manners this
time
Dwalin and Balin here already I see said Kili Let us join the throng
Throng thought Mr Baggins I dont like the sound of that I really must
sit down for a minute and collect my wits and have a drink He had only just
had a sipin the corner while the four dwarves sat round the table and talked
about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins and the depredations of
dragons and lots of other things which he did not understand and did not want
