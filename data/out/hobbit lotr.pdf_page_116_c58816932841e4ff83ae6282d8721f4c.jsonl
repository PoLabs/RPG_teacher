ending But they had to go on and on long after they were sick for a sight of the
sun and of the sky and longed for the feel of wind on their faces There was no
movement of air down under the forestroof and it was everlastingly still and
dark and stuffy Even the dwarves felt it who were used to tunnelling and lived
at times for long whiles without the light of the sun but the hobbit who liked
holes to make a house in but not to spend summer days in felt that he was being
slowly suffocated
The nights were the worst It then became pitchdarknot what you call
pitchdark but really pitch so black that you really could see nothing Bilbo
tried flapping his hand in front of his nose but he could not see it at all Well
perhaps it is not true to say that they could see nothing they could see eyes
They slept all closely huddled together and took it in turns to watch and when it

All this went on for what seemed to the hobbit ages upon ages and he was
always hungry for they were extremely careful with their provisions Even so as
days followed days and still the forest seemed just the same they began to get
anxious The food would not last for ever it was in fact already beginning to get
low They tried shooting at the squirrels and they wasted many arrows before
they managed to bring one down on the path But when they roasted it it proved
horrible to taste and they shot no more squirrels
They were thirsty too for they had none too much water and in all the time
they had seen neither spring nor stream This was their state when one day they
