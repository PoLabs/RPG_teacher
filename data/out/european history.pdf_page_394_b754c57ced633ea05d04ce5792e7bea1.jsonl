Years War 17561763 historian David Bell nonetheless speaks of a new 
total war Civilian casualties range between 075 and 3 million in Tirol Spain 
Italy Russia and France irregular bands of armed rebels and citizens fought 
alongside conscripted soldiers On top of all casualties countless soldiers came 
home as invalids thereby adding to the misery and poverty of their family 
members In the Netherlands seventy percent of conscripts never returned 
These wars were among the last belonging to the age of men when wars 
were waged with infantry and cavalry The age of machines and technology 
with its industrial capacities to destroy had not yet arrived but the last 
large battle of the Napoleonic Wars the Battle of Waterloo 1815 already 
demonstrated the tremendous power of artillery devastating columns of 
infantrymen The socioeconomic military and especially human costs of these 
wars were catastrophic They provoked new reflection from figures such as the 
Prussian strategist Carl von Clausewitz who himself participated in the wars 
developing his military theory in the book On War published posthumously 
in 1832 More than half of all the casualties and victims fell in the last three 
years of the wars when the scale of armies and battlefields grew considerably 
The effect of this was first and foremost to create vivid lasting memories of

Haitian Revolution in 1791 The ensuing battles and massacres occurred in the 
context of Frances long and troubling colonial rule in SaintDomingue as 
Haiti was called before 1804 but it was also a subaltern genocide against 
the colonisers killing between 3000 and 5000 people and demonstrating 
how new technologies of warfare were already being used in nonEuropean 
spaces by1804
The wars also prompted a transition away from increasingly obsolete 
fortresseswith the last great fortresses being erected along the northeastern 
border of France the Wellington Barrier and along the North American East 
Coast Instead there was new investment in rapid transportation infrastructures 
with the advent of railroads new information and communication 
technologies and the training and use of massconscripted armies Napoleon 
had raised the stakes with his use of leves en masse and the introduction of 
semaphores optic telegraphs into his operational communications the post
1815 monarchies and empires would not forget these developments
The industrial age expanded the scope of warfare both on land and at 
sea Warfare moved from handtohand combat and beyond the immediate
