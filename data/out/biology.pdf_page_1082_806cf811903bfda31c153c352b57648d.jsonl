actually outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten Neurons would be unable to function without the
vital roles that are fulfilled by these glial cells Glia guide developing neurons to their destinations buffer ions
and chemicals that would otherwise harm neurons and provide myelin sheaths around axons Scientists have
recently discovered that they also play a role in responding to nerve activity and modulating communication
between nerve cells When glia do not function properly the result can be disastrousmost brain tumors are
caused by mutations in glia
Types of Glia
There are several different types of glia with different functions two of which are shown in Figure 357
Astrocytes shown in Figure 358a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS They provide
nutrients and other substances to neurons regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular
fluid and provide structural support for synapses Astrocytes also form the bloodbrain barriera structure
that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the brain Astrocytes in particular have been shown through
calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity transmit calcium waves between
astrocytes and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural
support for neurons in the PNS Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading
microorganisms Oligodendrocytes shown in Figure 358b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS One
axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple
neurons This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the
entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate
to their end destinations Ependymal cells line fluidfilled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the
spinal cord They are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid which serves as a cushion for the brain
moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain and is a component for the choroid plexus
Figure 357 Glial cells support neurons and maintain their environment Glial cells of the a central nervous system
include oligodendrocytes astrocytes ependymal cells and microglial cells Oligodendrocytes form the myelin sheath
around axons Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons maintain their extracellular environment and provide structural
support Microglia scavenge pathogens and dead cells Ependymal cells produce cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the
neurons Glial cells of the b peripheral nervous system include Schwann cells which form the myelin sheath and
satellite cells which provide nutrients and structural support to neurons
