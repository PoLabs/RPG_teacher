Figure 423 Two intertwined actin strands comprise microfilaments
ATP powers actin to assemble its filamentous form which serves as a track for the movement of a motor
protein we call myosin This enables actin to engage in cellular events requiring motion such as cell division
in eukaryotic cells and cytoplasmic streaming which is the cell cytoplasms circular movement in plant cells
Actin and myosin are plentiful in muscle cells When your actin and myosin filaments slide past each other your
muscles contract
Microfilaments also provide some rigidity and shape to the cell They can depolymerize disassemble and
reform quickly thus enabling a cell to change its shape and move White blood cells your bodys infection
fighting cells make good use of this ability They can move to an infection site and phagocytize the pathogen
To see an example of a white blood cell in action watch a short timelapse video of the cell capturing two 
bacteria It engulfs one and then moves on to the other This multimedia resource will open in a

Intermediate Filaments
Several strands of fibrous proteins that are wound together comprise intermediate filaments Figure 424
Cytoskeleton elements get their name from the fact that their diameter 8 to 10 nm is between those of
microfilaments and microtubules
