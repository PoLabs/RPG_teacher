written texts Writing began to form part of social reality Literate mentalities 
developed which allowed those who could read and write to form a different 
view of the world
In the thirteenth century the numbers of documents that were produced 
increased dramatically as did school texts Books began to resemble the 
books we use today Catalogues and inventories were made to help visitors 
find texts in libraries and archives Earlier oral legal practices were put into 
writing and trust in the written word increased It became necessary to learn 
to write correctly in order to study at a university and embark on a career in 
law or medicine or to be trained as a notary public Knowledge and applied 
knowledge became separated from one another and teaching was shifting its 
attention towards societys new demands for literacy A flywheel was set in 
motion and started to gather speed This was fed by formal schooling in the 
arts of the written word Schooling imbued knowledge which might be applied 
as a techniqueas technology The development of technology deepened the 
complexity of society This increased complexity in turn increased demand 
for schooling and so on All this made the thirteenth century into a key period 
in the history of European literacy An audience developed for the products 
of the movabletype printing press developed by Johannes Gutenberg c 
14001468 around 1440 This happened especially in the towns where formal 
schooling took place where universities developed and where the demand 
for consulting books shaped new forms of written texts
The introduction of the printing press was momentous The medieval 
millennium produced some 11000000 manuscript books but in only the 
first halfcentury of its existence until around 1500 the printing press had 
already produced several millions of books Not all printed books contained 
texts that modernday Europeans would consider as knowledge But some 
books did and the printing press generated a written culture that over the 
early modern centuries saw the rise of forms of scholarship and science with 
which we are still familiar today An intellectual community of scholars the 
socalled Republic of Letters corresponded by letter and published the results 
of their research in printed books Printed scholarly journals first appeared 
in the seventeenth century From the fifteenth century scholars housed their 
libraries in studies at their private homes These small rooms could also house 
collections of curiosities The first European museums also appeared in the 
fifteenth century as did the first public libraries Meanwhile small laboratories 
came into existence for alchemy and medicine Places for research in teams were 
to develop only in the nineteenth century until then pure scientific research 
and scholarship required considerable investments of time and money
The eighteenthcentury Enlightenment saw writing as the engine of 
civilisation and the prehistoric period as somehow of lesser value than periods
