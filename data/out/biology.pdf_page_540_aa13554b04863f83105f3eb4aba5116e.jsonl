Figure 199 A yellowthroated sideblotched lizard is smaller than either the bluethroated or orangethroated males

In this scenario natural selection favors orange males when blue males dominate the population Blue males
will thrive when the population is mostly yellow males and yellow males will be selected for when orange
males are the most populous As a result populations of sideblotched lizards cycle in the distribution of these
phenotypesin one generation orange might predominate and then yellow males will begin to rise in frequency
Once yellow males comprise a majority of the population blue males will be selected Finally when blue males
become common orange males once again will be favored
Negative frequencydependent selection serves to increase the populations genetic variance by selecting
for rare phenotypes whereas positive frequencydependent selection usually decreases genetic variance by
selecting for common phenotypes
Sexual Selection
Males and females of certain species are often quite different from one another in ways beyond the reproductive
organs Males are often larger for example and display many elaborate colors and adornments like the
peacocks tail while females tend to be smaller and duller in decoration We call such differences sexual
dimorphisms Figure 1910 which arise in many populations particularly animal populations where there
is more variance in the males reproductive success than that of the females That is some malesoften the
bigger stronger or more decorated malesobtain the vast majority of the total matings while others receive
none This can occur because the males are better at fighting off other males or because females will choose to
mate with the bigger or more decorated males In either case this variation in reproductive success generates a
strong selection pressure among males to obtain those matings resulting in the evolution of bigger body size and
elaborate ornaments to attract the females attention Females however tend to achieve a handful of selected
matings therefore they are more likely to select more desirable males
Sexual dimorphism varies widely among species and some species are even sexrole reversed In such cases
females tend to have a greater variance in their reproductive success than males and are correspondingly
selected for the bigger body size and elaborate traits usually characteristic of males
