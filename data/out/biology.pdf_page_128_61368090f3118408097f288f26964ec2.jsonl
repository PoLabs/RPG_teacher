pigments structural components and surface receptors there are ribosomes in practically every cell
Ribosomes are particularly abundant in cells that synthesize large amounts of protein For example the
pancreas is responsible for creating several digestive enzymes and the cells that produce these enzymes
contain many ribosomes Thus we see another example of form following function
Mitochondria
Scientists often call mitochondria singular  mitochondrion the cells powerhouses or energy factories
because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate ATP the cells main energycarrying
molecule ATP represents the cells shortterm stored energy Cellular respiration is the process of making
ATP using the chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients In mitochondria this process uses oxygen and
produces carbon dioxide as a waste product In fact the carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes
from the cellular reactions that produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct
In keeping with our theme of form following function it is important to point out that muscle cells have a very high
concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP Your muscle cells need considerable energy to keep your body
moving When your cells dont get enough oxygen they do not make much ATP Instead producing lactic acid
accompanies the small amount of ATP they make in the absence of oxygen
Mitochondria are ovalshaped double membrane organelles Figure 414 that have their own ribosomes and
DNA Each membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins The inner layer has folds called cristae
We call the area surrounded by the folds the mitochondrial matrix The cristae and the matrix have different roles
in cellular respiration
Figure 414 This electron micrograph shows a mitochondrion through an electron microscope This organelle has
an outer membrane and an inner membrane The inner membrane contains folds called cristae which increase its
surface area We call the space between the two membranes the intermembrane space and the space inside the inner
membrane the mitochondrial matrix ATP synthesis takes place on the inner membrane credit modification of work

Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes are small round organelles enclosed by single membranes They carry out oxidation reactions
that break down fatty acids and amino acids They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body Many of
these oxidation reactions release hydrogen peroxide H2O2 which would be damaging to cells however when
these reactions are confined to peroxisomes enzymes safely break down the H2O2 into oxygen and water For
example peroxisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol Glyoxysomes which are specialized peroxisomes in plants
are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars Plant cells contain many different types of peroxisomes
that play a role in metabolism pathogene defense and stress response to mention a few
Vesicles and Vacuoles
Vesicles and vacuoles are membranebound sacs that function in storage and transport Other than the fact
that vacuoles are somewhat larger than vesicles there is a very subtle distinction between them Vesicle
membranes can fuse with either the plasma membrane or other membrane systems within the cell Additionally
some agents such as enzymes within plant vacuoles break down macromolecules The vacuoles membrane
does not fuse with the membranes of other cellular components
Animal Cells versus Plant Cells
At this point you know that each eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane cytoplasm a nucleus ribosomes
mitochondria peroxisomes and in some vacuoles but there are some striking differences between animal
