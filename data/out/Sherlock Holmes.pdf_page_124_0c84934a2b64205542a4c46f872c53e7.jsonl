The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor
T
he Lord St Simon marriage and its curi
ous termination have long ceased to be a
subject of interest in those exalted circles in
which the unfortunate bridegroom moves
Fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more pi
quant details have drawn the gossips away from this
fouryearold drama As I have reason to believe how
ever that the full facts have never been revealed to the
general public and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had
a considerable share in clearing the matter up I feel
that no memoir of him would be complete without
some little sketch of this remarkable episode
It was a few weeks before my own marriage dur
ing the days when I was still sharing rooms with
Holmes in Baker Street that he came home from an
afternoon stroll to nd a letter on the table waiting for
him I had remained indoors all day for the weather
had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autum
nal winds and the Jezail bullet which I had brought
back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan
campaign throbbed with dull persistence With my
body in one easychair and my legs upon another I
had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers
until at last saturated with the news of the day I
tossed them all aside and lay listless watching the
huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon
the table and wondering lazily who my friends noble
correspondent could be
Here is a very fashionable epistle I remarked
as he entered Your morning letters if I remember
right were from a shmonger and a tidewaiter
Yes my correspondence has certainly the charm
of variety he answered smiling and the humbler
are usually the more interesting This looks like one of
those unwelcome social summonses which call upon
a man either to be bored or to lie
He broke the seal and glanced over the contents
Oh come it may prove to be something of inter
est after all
Not social then
No distinctly professional
And from a noble client
One of the highest in England
My dear fellow I congratulate you
I assure you Watson without affectation that
the status of my client is a matter of less moment to
me than the interest of his case It is just possible
however that that also may not be wanting in this
new investigation You have been reading the papers
diligently of late have you not
It looks like it said I ruefully pointing to a huge
bundle in the corner I have had nothing else to do
It is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to
post me up I read nothing except the criminal news
and the agony column The latter is always instruc
tive But if you have followed recent events so closely
you must have read about Lord St Simon and his
wedding
Oh yes with the deepest interest
That is well The letter which I hold in my hand
is from Lord St Simon I will read it to you and in
return you must turn over these papers and let me
have whatever bears upon the matter This is what he
says
 My dear Mr Sherlock Holmes
 Lord Backwater tells me that I may
place implicit reliance upon your judg
ment and discretion I have determined
therefore to call upon you and to consult
you in reference to the very painful event
which has occurred in connection with my
wedding Mr Lestrade of Scotland Yard
is acting already in the matter but he as
sures me that he sees no objection to your
cooperation and that he even thinks that
it might be of some assistance I will call at
four oclock in the afternoon and should
you have any other engagement at that
time I hope that you will postpone it as
this matter is of paramount importance
  Yours faithfully
 St Simon
It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions written
with a quill pen and the noble lord has had the mis
fortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of
his right little nger remarked Holmes as he folded
up the epistle
He says four oclock It is three now He will be
here in an hour
Then I have just time with your assistance to
get clear upon the subject Turn over those papers
and arrange the extracts in their order of time while
I take a glance as to who our client is He picked a
redcovered volume from a line of books of reference
beside the mantelpiece Here he is said he sitting
down and attening it out upon his knee  Lord
Robert Walsingham de Vere St Simon second son of
the Duke of Balmoral Hum Arms Azure three
