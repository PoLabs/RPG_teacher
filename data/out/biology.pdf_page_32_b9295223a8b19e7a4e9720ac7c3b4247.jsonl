environmental changes through homeostasis literally steady state For example an organism needs to
regulate body temperature through the thermoregulation process Organisms that live in cold climates such as
the polar bear Figure 113 have body structures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve
body heat Structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur feathers blubber and fat In hot climates
organisms have methods such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs that help them to shed excess
body heat
Energy Processing
Figure 114 The California condor Gymnogyps californianus uses chemical energy derived from food to power flight
California condors are an endangered species This bird has a wing tag that helps biologists identify the individual

All organisms use a source of energy for their metabolic activities Some organisms capture energy from the
sun and convert it into chemical energy in food Others use chemical energy in molecules they take in as food

Levels of Organization of Living Things
Living things are highly organized and structured following a hierarchy that we can examine on a scale
from small to large The atom is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter It consists of a nucleus
surrounded by electrons Atoms form molecules A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least
two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds Many molecules that are biologically important are
macromolecules large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization a polymer is a large molecule
that is made by combining smaller units called monomers which are simpler than macromolecules An example
of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid DNA Figure 115 which contains the instructions for the
structure and functioning of all living organisms
