tens of millions of people the demography of Europe had been drastically 
reordered As a result of this ethnic sortition European states were now 
composed of much more homogeneous national groups which at the same 
time consisted of many people who were very recent migrants The Cold 
War and consequent division of Europe also led to a bifurcation in migration 
flows in the east countries were generally confronted with the emigration 
of political and ethnic minorities further reinforcing the cultural uniformity 
of these countries despite some immigration from developing countries for 
example of Vietnamese students and workers into East Germany Western 
Europe on the other hand became a region of immigration which led to new 
forms of diversity 
In the context of the Cold War and the imposition of communist rule in 
Eastern Europe many fled from oppression Until the construction of the Berlin 
Wall in 1961 around 35 million people fled from East to West Germany Also 
tens of thousands of people fled from other communist countries annually with 
surges after the uprisings in Hungary 1956 and Czechoslovakia 1968 and 
the imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981 After the partial liberalisation 
of emigration policies in the Soviet Union in the 1980s more than half of the 
remaining 25 million Jews fled from the persistent antisemitic tendencies 
they had faced there A final chapter of emigration from communist countries 
resulted from the war that ensued in 1991 after the breakup of Yugoslavia 
after which some 400000 people fled to the West with half of them ending up 
in Germany
The picture for Western Europe in the postwar period is very different 
There immigration set the tone from Southern Europe and Northern Africa 
but also from the former colonies after the Second World War brought down 
the colonial empires of Britain France the Netherlands Belgium and finally 
also Portugal 
From 1948 onwards Western Europe went through an extended period of 
unprecedented economic growth which lasted until the mid1970s Rising 
investment wages and consumer demand contributed to acute shortages 
on the labour market especially for lowskilled and lowerpaid labour 
This inspired national governments in close cooperation with employers 
organisations to invite ablebodied people to come to work in the industrial 
centres of Europe Initially many came from the poorest regions of Italy 
Spain and Portugal to the urban centres in their own country But soon this 
internal migration was overtaken by migration to France Germany and the 
Benelux countries Between the 1950s and the 1970s several million Italians 
around one million Spaniards and 15 million Portuguesea fifth of the
