tubule of the nephron that arises from the glomerulus
branch of a vein that exits the kidney and joins the inferior vena cava
biochemical pathway that activates angiotensin II which increases blood
pressure
artery that branches from the renal artery
membrane that allows only certain solutes to pass through
maximum amount of solute that can be transported out of the renal tubules during
reabsorption
reclamation of water and solutes that got filtered out in the glomerulus
process of secretion of wastes that do not get reabsorbed
pathway by which ammonia is converted to urea
describes animals that secrete urea as the primary nitrogenous waste material
urinebearing tube coming out of the kidney carries urine to the bladder
byproduct of ammonia metabolism in birds insects and reptiles
structure that the ureters empty the urine into stores urine
filtrate produced by kidneys that gets excreted out of the body
peritubular network that surrounds the loop of Henle of the juxtamedullary nephrons
compound that increases the diameter of blood vessels
another name for antidiuretic hormone
CHAPTER SUMMARY
411 Osmoregulation and Osmotic Balance
Solute concentrations across semipermeable membranes influence the movement of water and solutes across
the membrane It is the number of solute molecules and not the molecular size that is important in osmosis
Osmoregulation and osmotic balance are important bodily functions resulting in water and salt balance Not all
solutes can pass through a semipermeable membrane Osmosis is the movement of water across the
membrane Osmosis occurs to equalize the number of solute molecules across a semipermeable membrane
by the movement of water to the side of higher solute concentration Facilitated diffusion utilizes protein
channels to move solute molecules from areas of higher to lower concentration while active transport
mechanisms are required to move solutes against concentration gradients Osmolarity is measured in units of
milliequivalents or milliosmoles both of which take into consideration the number of solute particles and the
charge on them Fish that live in freshwater or saltwater adapt by being osmoregulators or osmoconformers
412 The Kidneys and Osmoregulatory Organs
The kidneys are the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems they function to filter blood and
maintain the osmolarity of body fluids at 300 mOsm They are surrounded by three layers and are made up
internally of three distinct regionsthe cortex medulla and pelvis
The blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the kidneys arise from and merge with the aorta and
inferior vena cava respectively The renal arteries branch out from the aorta and enter the kidney where they
further divide into segmental interlobar arcuate and cortical radiate arteries
The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney which actively filters blood and generates urine The nephron is
made up of the renal corpuscle and renal tubule Cortical nephrons are found in the renal cortex while
