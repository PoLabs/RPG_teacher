investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators
Explore this interactive website httpopenstaxcollegeorglpollination to review selfpollination and
crosspollination
Living species are designed to ensure survival of their progeny those that fail become extinct Genetic diversity
is therefore required so that in changing environmental or stress conditions some of the progeny can survive
Selfpollination leads to the production of plants with less genetic diversity since genetic material from the same
plant is used to form gametes and eventually the zygote In contrast crosspollinationor outcrossingleads
to greater genetic diversity because the microgametophyte and megagametophyte are derived from different
plants
Because crosspollination allows for more genetic diversity plants have developed many ways to avoid self
pollination In some species the pollen and the ovary mature at different times These flowers make self
pollination nearly impossible By the time pollen matures and has been shed the stigma of this flower is mature
and can only be pollinated by pollen from another flower Some flowers have developed physical features
that prevent selfpollination The primrose is one such flower Primroses have evolved two flower types with
differences in anther and stigma length the pineyed flower has anthers positioned at the pollen tubes halfway
point and the thrumeyed flowers stigma is likewise located at the halfway point Insects easily crosspollinate
while seeking the nectar at the bottom of the pollen tube This phenomenon is also known as heterostyly Many
plants such as cucumber have male and female flowers located on different parts of the plant thus making self
pollination difficult In yet other species the male and female flowers are borne on different plants dioecious All
of these are barriers to selfpollination therefore the plants depend on pollinators to transfer pollen The majority
of pollinators are biotic agents such as insects like bees flies and butterflies bats birds and other animals
Other plant species are pollinated by abiotic agents such as wind and water
Incompatibility Genes in Flowers
In recent decades incompatibility geneswhich prevent pollen from germinating or growing into the stigma
of a flowerhave been discovered in many angiosperm species If plants do not have compatible genes
the pollen tube stops growing Selfincompatibility is controlled by the S sterility locus Pollen tubes have
to grow through the tissue of the stigma and style before they can enter the ovule The carpel is selective
in the type of pollen it allows to grow inside The interaction is primarily between the pollen and the stigma
epidermal cells In some plants like cabbage the pollen is rejected at the surface of the stigma and the
unwanted pollen does not germinate In other plants pollen tube germination is arrested after growing
onethird the length of the style leading to pollen tube death Pollen tube death is due either to apoptosis
programmed cell death or to degradation of pollen tube RNA The degradation results from the activity
of a ribonuclease encoded by the S locus The ribonuclease is secreted from the cells of the style in the
extracellular matrix which lies alongside the growing pollen tube
In summary selfincompatibility is a mechanism that prevents selffertilization in many flowering plant
species The working of this selfincompatibility mechanism has important consequences for plant breeders
because it inhibits the production of inbred and hybrid plants
Pollination by Insects
Bees are perhaps the most important pollinator of many garden plants and most commercial fruit trees Figure
3212 The most common species of bees are bumblebees and honeybees Since bees cannot see the color
red beepollinated flowers usually have shades of blue yellow or other colors Bees collect energyrich pollen
or nectar for their survival and energy needs They visit flowers that are open during the day are brightly colored
