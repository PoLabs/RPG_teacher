43  Eukaryotic Cells
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the structure of eukaryotic cells

Compare animal cells with plant cells

State the role of the plasma membrane

Summarize the functions of the major cell organelles
Have you ever heard the phrase form follows function Its a philosophy that many industries follow In
architecture this means that buildings should be constructed to support the activities that will be carried out
inside them For example a skyscraper should include several elevator banks A hospital should have its
emergency room easily accessible
Our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function especially in cell biology and this will
become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells  Figure 48 Unlike prokaryotic cells eukaryotic cells have 1
a membranebound nucleus 2 numerous membranebound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum
Golgi apparatus chloroplasts mitochondria and others and 3 several rodshaped chromosomes Because a
membrane surrounds eukaryotic cells nucleus it has a true nucleus The word organelle means little organ
and as we already mentioned organelles have specialized cellular functions just as your bodys organs have
specialized functions
At this point it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic
cells Organelles allow different functions to be compartmentalized in different areas of the cell Before turning to
organelles lets first examine two important components of the cell the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm
