ensuing progressive legislation Whether ruling elites expanded the franchise 
for ideological reasons or due to instrumental calculations aimed at avoiding 
insurrection or in order to foster economic growth by subsidising education 
of the poor and thus indirectly allowing for their political mobilisation the 
fact is that Britain and later most of Europe introduced reforms and policies 
targeting income inequality and its negative implications on social welfare 
and cohesion
Conclusion
The nineteenth century saw growing wealth inequality both within and 
between European countries The reason for this increase in inequality was 
an unequal distribution of gains from dynamic economic growth Wealth 
disparities were particularly pronounced in cities where industrial labour was 
concentrated Tackling urban poverty resulted in action by city authorities 
like regulation of housing conditions The labour movement became a massive 
phenomenon and spurred government action like changes in the suffrage 
system or the introduction of social insurance The economic growth of the era 
nonetheless led to an increase in living standards for all in the long run
Inequality in the distribution of wealth and income that grew significantly 
in nineteenthcentury Europe shrank remarkably in the twentieth century 
but inequality is now once again widening in the present In his widely read 
book Capital in the TwentyFirst Century 2013 the French economist Thomas 
Piketty characterises this as the return of social inequalities of the Belle poque 
and the Gilded Age According to Piketty the price of economic growth and 
progress is extreme inequality in the distribution of wealth and income in the 
twentyfirst century This is and will remain an important issue As longrun 
historical approaches to inequality have shown growing inequality cannot be 
expected to decline automatically with economic growth and institutions and 
human agency have a significant role to play in either remedying or ratifying 
inequalities
Discussion questions
1	
How did wealth and income distribution change in the long nineteenth 
century
2	
How can geographical mobility be interpreted in the context of 
distribution of wealth and income during the nineteenth century
3	
What kind of intellectual debates emerged about the distribution of 
wealth during that time
