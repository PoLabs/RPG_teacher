Flatworms have three embryonic tissue layers that give rise to epidermal tissues from ectoderm the lining of
the digestive system from endoderm and other internal tissues from mesoderm The epidermal tissue is a
single layer of cells or a layer of fused cells  syncytium that covers two layers of muscle one circular and
the other longitudinal The mesodermal tissues include mesenchymal cells that contain collagen and support
secretory cells that produce mucus and other materials at the surface Because flatworms are acoelomates
the mesodermal layer forms a solid mass between the outer epidermal surface and the cavity of the digestive
system
Physiological Processes of Flatworms
The freeliving species of flatworms are predators or scavengers Parasitic forms feed by absorbing nutrients
provided by their hosts Most flatworms such as the planarian shown in Figure 2814 have a branching
gastrovascular cavity rather than a complete digestive system In such animals the mouth is also used to expel
waste materials from the digestive system and thus also serves as an anus A few species may have a second
anal pore or opening The gut may be a simple sac or highly branched Digestion is primarily extracellular with
digested materials taken into the cells of the gut lining by phagocytosis One parasitic group the tapeworms
cestodes lacks a digestive system altogether and absorb digested food from the host
Flatworms have an excretory system with a network of tubules attached to flame cells whose cilia beat to direct
waste fluids concentrated in the tubules out of the body through excretory pores The system is responsible
for the regulation of dissolved salts and the excretion of nitrogenous wastes The nervous system consists of
a pair of lateral nerve cords running the length of the body with transverse connections between them Two
large cerebral gangliaconcentrations of nerve cell bodies at the anterior end of the wormare associated with
photosensory and chemosensory cells There is neither a circulatory nor a respiratory system with gas and
nutrient exchange dependent on diffusion and celltocell junctions This necessarily limits the thickness of the
body in these organisms constraining them to be flat worms Most flatworm species are monoecious both
male and female reproductive organs are found in the same individual and fertilization is typically internal
Asexual reproduction by fission is common in some groups
