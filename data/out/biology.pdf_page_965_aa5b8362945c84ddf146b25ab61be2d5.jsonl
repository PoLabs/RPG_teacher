Hydroponics
Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in a waternutrient solution instead of soil Since its advent
hydroponics has developed into a growing process that researchers often use Scientists who are interested
in studying plant nutrient deficiencies can use hydroponics to study the effects of different nutrient
combinations under strictly controlled conditions Hydroponics has also developed as a way to grow flowers
vegetables and other crops in greenhouse environments You might find hydroponically grown produce
at your local grocery store Today many lettuces and tomatoes in your market have been hydroponically
grown
312  The Soil
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how soils are formed

Explain soil composition

Describe a soil profile
Plants obtain inorganic elements from the soil which serves as a natural medium for land plants Soil is the
outer loose layer that covers the surface of Earth Soil quality is a major determinant along with climate of
plant distribution and growth Soil quality depends not only on the chemical composition of the soil but also the
topography regional surface features and the presence of living organisms In agriculture the history of the
soil such as the cultivating practices and previous crops modify the characteristics and fertility of that soil
Soil develops very slowly over long periods of time and its formation results from natural and environmental
forces acting on mineral rock and organic compounds Soils can be divided into two groups organic soils are
those that are formed from sedimentation and primarily composed of organic matter while those that are formed
