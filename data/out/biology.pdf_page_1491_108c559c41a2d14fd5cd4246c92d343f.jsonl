The Chesapeake Bay has long been valued as one of the most scenic areas on Earth it is now in distress
and is recognized as a declining ecosystem In the 1970s the Chesapeake Bay was one of the first
ecosystems to have identified dead zones which continue to kill many fish and bottomdwelling species
such as clams oysters and worms Several species have declined in the Chesapeake Bay due to surface
water runoff containing excess nutrients from artificial fertilizer used on land The source of the fertilizers
with high nitrogen and phosphate content is not limited to agricultural practices There are many nearby
urban areas and more than 150 rivers and streams empty into the bay that are carrying fertilizer runoff
from lawns and gardens Thus the decline of the Chesapeake Bay is a complex issue and requires the
cooperation of industry agriculture and everyday homeowners
Of particular interest to conservationists is the oyster population it is estimated that more than 200000
acres of oyster reefs existed in the bay in the 1700s but that number has now declined to only 36000
acres Oyster harvesting was once a major industry for Chesapeake Bay but it declined 88 percent between
1982 and 2007 This decline was due not only to fertilizer runoff and dead zones but also to overharvesting
Oysters require a certain minimum population density because they must be in close proximity to reproduce
Human activity has altered the oyster population and locations greatly disrupting the ecosystem
The restoration of the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing for several years with
mixed success Not only do many people find oysters good to eat but they also clean up the bay Oysters
are filter feeders and as they eat they clean the water around them In the 1700s it was estimated that
it took only a few days for the oyster population to filter the entire volume of the bay Today with changed
water conditions it is estimated that the present population would take nearly a year to do the same job
Restoration efforts have been ongoing for several years by nonprofit organizations such as the Chesapeake
Bay Foundation The restoration goal is to find a way to increase population density so the oysters can
reproduce more efficiently Many diseaseresistant varieties developed at the Virginia Institute of Marine
Science for the College of William and Mary are now available and have been used in the construction
of experimental oyster reefs Efforts to clean and restore the bay by Virginia and Delaware have been
hampered because much of the pollution entering the bay comes from other states which stresses the need
for interstate cooperation to gain successful restoration
The new hearty oyster strains have also spawned a new and economically viable industryoyster
