crocodiles have been clocked at speeds over 17 kph and over short distances in an ambush situation they can
easily chase down most humans if they are taken by surprise However they are short distance runners not
interested in a long chase and most fit humans can probably outrun them in a sprint assuming they respond
quickly to the ambush

Sphenodontia
Sphenodontia wedge tooth arose in the early Mesozoic era when they had a moderate radiation but
now are represented by only two living species Sphenodon punctatus and Sphenodon guntheri both found
on offshore islands in New Zealand Figure 2928 The common name tuatara comes from a Maori word
describing the crest along its back Tuataras have a primitive diapsid skull with biconcave vertebrae They
measure up to 80 centimeters and weigh about 1 kilogram Although superficially similar to an iguanid lizard
several unique features of the skull and jaws clearly define them and distinguish this group from the Squamata
They have no external ears Tuataras briefly have a third parietal eyewith a lens retina and corneain the
middle of the forehead The eye is visible only in very young animals it is soon covered with skin Parietal eyes
can sense light but have limited color discrimination Similar lightsensing structures are also seen in some other
lizards In their jaws tuataras have two rows of teeth in the upper jaw that bracket a single row of teeth in the
lower jaw These teeth are actually projections from the jawbones and are not replaced as they wear down

Squamata
The Squamata scaly or having scales arose in the late Permian and extant species include lizards and
snakes Both are found on all continents except Antarctica Lizards and snakes are most closely related to
tuataras both groups having evolved from a lepidosaurian ancestor Squamata is the largest extant clade of
reptiles Figure 2929
