The moss sporophyte is dependent on the gametophyte for nutrients The slender seta plural setae as seen
in Figure 2515 contains tubular cells that transfer nutrients from the base of the sporophyte the foot to the
sporangium or capsule
Figure 2515 Moss sporophyte This photograph shows the long slender stems called setae connected to capsules
of the moss Thamnobryum alopecurum The operculum and remnants of the calyptra are visible in some capsules
credit modification of work by Hermann Schachner
Spore mother cells in the sporangium undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores The sporophyte has several
features that protect the developing spores and aid in their dispersal The calyptra derived from the walls of
the archegonium covers the sporangium A structure called the operculum is at the tip of the spore capsule
The calyptra and operculum fall off when the spores are ready for dispersal The peristome tissue around the
mouth of the capsule is made of triangular closefitting units like little teeth The peristome opens and closes
depending on moisture levels and periodically releases spores
254  Seedless Vascular Plants
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify the new traits that first appear in seedless tracheophytes

Discuss how each trait is important for adaptation to life on land

Identify the classes of seedless tracheophytes

Describe the life cycle of a fern

Explain the role of seedless plants in the ecosystem
The vascular plants or tracheophytes are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants More than
260000 species of tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of Earths vegetation Several evolutionary
innovations explain their success and their ability to spread to all habitats
Bryophytes may have been successful at the transition from an aquatic habitat to land but they are still
dependent on water for reproduction and must absorb moisture and nutrients through the gametophyte surface
The lack of roots for absorbing water and minerals from the soil as well as a lack of ligninreinforced conducting
cells limit bryophytes to small sizes Although they may survive in reasonably dry conditions they cannot
reproduce and expand their habitat range in the absence of water Vascular plants on the other hand can
achieve enormous heights thus competing successfully for light Photosynthetic organs become leaves and
pipelike cells or vascular tissues transport water minerals and fixed carbon organic compounds throughout the
organism
Throughout plant evolution there is a progressive increase in the dominance of the sporophyte generation In
seedless vascular plants the diploid sporophyte is the dominant phase of the life cycle The gametophyte is now
less conspicuous but still independent of the sporophyte Seedless vascular plants still depend on water during
fertilization as the flagellated sperm must swim on a layer of moisture to reach the egg This step in reproduction
explains why ferns and their relatives are more abundant in damp environments
