Generational Conflicts
Peer group manifestations as discussed above regularly resulted in conflicts 
between youths and adults who for instance disapproved of the adolescents 
practices of growing their hair or drinking extensively Such tensions can 
hardly be interpreted as conflicts between generations as defined by the 
sociologist Karl Mannheim in Das Problem der Generationen 1928as cohorts 
of people of similar ages who share common experiences of sociohistorical 
events Rather than suggesting conflicts between age cohorts early modern 
sources reflect generational conflicts between people at different life stages

unhappy marriage which had been arranged by his mother and which he 
ultimately broke off his decree of 1702 then confirmed the right of parents to 
choose partners for their children but gave children a right of refusal Parents 
were now legally prohibited from forcing a marriage to occur if either party 
was unhappy His reforms thus reflected both generational conflicts and the 
increasing agency of youths

has been rightly contested the interest in children youth and education 
did indeed grow during this period It did so against the backdrop of larger 
cultural transformations such as the Reformation and the Enlightenment 
The evolving views of children displayed several key tensions First
