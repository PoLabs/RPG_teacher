It was spring and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun before
Bilbo and Gandalf took their leave at last of Beorn and though he longed for
home Bilbo left with regret for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn were in
springtime no less marvellous than in high summer
At last they came up the long road and reached the very pass where the
goblins had captured them before But they came to that high point at morning
and looking backward they saw a white sun shining over the outstretched lands
There behind lay Mirkwood blue in the distance and darkly green at the nearer
edge even in the spring There far away was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of
eyesight On its highest peak snow yet unmelted was gleaming pale
So comes snow after fire and even dragons have their ending said Bilbo
and he turned his back on his adventure The Tookish part was getting very tired
and the Baggins was daily getting stronger I wish now only to be in my own
armchair he said
