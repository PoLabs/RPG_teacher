The pain had gone as quickly as it had come Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look  a feeling that he
didnt like Harry at all
Whos that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell he asked Percy
Oh you know Quirrell already do you No wonder hes looking so
nervous thats Professor Snape He teaches Potions but he doesnt want
to  everyone knows hes after Quirrells job Knows an awful lot about
the Dark Arts Snape
Harry watched Snape for a while but Snape didnt look at him again
At last the desserts too disappeared and Professor Dumbledore got to
his feet again The hall fell silent
Ahern  just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered I
have a few startofterm notices to give you
First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to
all pupils And a few of our older students would do well to remember
that as well
Dumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley
twins
I have also been asked by Mr Filch the caretaker to remind you all
that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors
Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term Anyone
interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch
And finally I must tell you that this year the thirdfloor corridor
on the righthand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to
die a very painful death
Harry laughed but he was one of the few who did
Hes not serious he muttered to Percy
