material for evolution and adaptation in a species A species future potential for adaptation depends on the
genetic diversity held in the genomes of the individuals in populations that make up the species The same is
true for higher taxonomic categories A genus with very different types of species will have more genetic diversity
than a genus with species that are genetically similar and have similar ecologies If there were a choice between
one of these genera of species being preserved the one with the greatest potential for subsequent evolution is
the most genetically diverse one
Many genes code for proteins which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and
reproducing Genetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a
variety of chemicals in their cells both the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism This
chemical diversity has potential benefit for humans as a source of pharmaceuticals so it provides one way to
measure diversity that is important to human health and welfare
Humans have generated diversity in domestic animals plants and fungi among many other organisms This
diversity is also suffering losses because of migration market forces and increasing globalism in agriculture
especially in densely populated regions such as China India and Japan The human population directly
depends on this diversity as a stable food source and its decline is troubling biologists and agricultural scientists
It is also useful to define ecosystem diversity meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or
within a given geographic area Figure 472 Whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species
might survive by adapting to other ecosystems The loss of an ecosystem means the loss of interactions between
species the loss of unique features of coadaptation and the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem
is able to create An example of a largely extinct ecosystem in North America is the prairie ecosystem
Prairies once spanned central North America from the boreal forest in northern Canada down into Mexico
They are now all but gone replaced by crop fields pasture lands and suburban sprawl Many of the species
survive elsewhere but the hugely productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating the most productive
agricultural soils in the United States is now gone As a consequence native soils are disappearing or must be
maintained and enhanced at great expense
