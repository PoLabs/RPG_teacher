Varying Rates of Speciation
Scientists around the world study speciation documenting observations both of living organisms and those
found in the fossil record As their ideas take shape and as research reveals new details about how life evolves
they develop models to help explain speciation rates In terms of how quickly speciation occurs we can observe
two current patterns gradual speciation model and punctuated equilibrium model
In the gradual speciation model species diverge gradually over time in small steps In the punctuated
equilibrium model a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species and then remains
largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward Figure 1823 We call this early change model punctuated
equilibrium because it begins with a punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward
While punctuated equilibrium suggests a faster tempo it does not necessarily exclude gradualism
Figure 1823 In a gradual speciation species diverge at a slow steady pace as traits change incrementally In
b punctuated equilibrium species diverge quickly and then remain unchanged for long periods of time
Which of the following statements is false
a
Punctuated equilibrium is most likely to occur in a small population that experiences a rapid change in
its environment
b
Punctuated equilibrium is most likely to occur in a large population that lives in a stable climate
c
Gradual speciation is most likely to occur in species that live in a stable climate
d
Gradual speciation and punctuated equilibrium both result in the divergence of species
The primary influencing factor on changes in speciation rate is environmental conditions Under some conditions
selection occurs quickly or radically Consider a species of snails that had been living with the same basic form
for many thousands of years Layers of their fossils would appear similar for a long time When a change in the
environment takes placesuch as a drop in the water levela small number of organisms are separated from
the rest in a brief period of time essentially forming one large and one tiny population The tiny population faces
new environmental conditions Because its gene pool quickly became so small any variation that surfaces and
that aids in surviving the new conditions becomes the predominant form
