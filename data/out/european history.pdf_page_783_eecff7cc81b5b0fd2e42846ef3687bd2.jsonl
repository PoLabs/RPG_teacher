63 CENTRES AND PERIPHERIES

the island legally remained in Genoese possession but came to be occupied 
and administered by France The new authorities however found powerful 
local institutions with Tuscan Italian as the dominant language Following a 
long history of central assemblies with delegates from every part of the island 
known as consulte the period of independence turned these gatherings 
into a veritable national assembly In 1755 this assembly adopted the 
Corsican Constitution which before the American and French Revolutions 
unambiguously declared the sovereignty of the people introduced the 
separation of powers and extended full voting rights for the new parliament 
the Diet Generale to all men over twentyfive years of age After 1768 the 
new French authorities would not tolerate such a system on its periphery A 
governor was installed on Corsica along with other agents of the King and the 
same system of social distinction and political representation used elsewhere 
in France was introduced Notably the Estates of Corsica were established 
with sixtynine deputies the first twentythree of whom had to prove their 
nobility the second twentythree of whom were members of the clergy and 
the third twentythree of whom represented the Third Estate Some degree of 
Corsican otherness was maintained though as the courts for example could 
draw on French law but also on local customs and the Genoese Statute of 1694 
French was prescribed for verdicts but the use of Italian was permitted in 
legal proceedings During the French Revolution the Constituent Assembly in 
Paris finally declared Corsica to be an integral part of France It also abolished 
the old regimes judicial and administrative institutions and replaced them 
with new republican ones 
The process of centralisation that drove the transformation of acquired 
territories into provinces did not only have political consequences New forms 
of elite participation in the state apparatus accompanied the development of a 
uniform administrative frame The evolution of centreperiphery relations in 
France also saw the renewal of services and service proposals by traditional 
social organisations no longer as expressions of submission to the sovereign 
but as reflections of the political and administrative roles taken up by the elites 
Provincial constitutional rhetoric continued to be expressed until the end of 
the ancien rgime More than that the traditional elites would mythologise 
the past confront the Kings agents with the idea of a spurned tradition and 
take refuge in the illusion of original freedom While they became fixated on 
the specificities of their local privileges the Kings agents would continue 
to conclude administrative and financial agreements with local assemblies 
Provincial law thus emerged from a discourse that the centre took seriously 
under specific circumstances At the same time a general questioning of the 
essence of government became prominent Stirred by philosophers like John 
Locke 16321704 and Montesquieu 16891755 and more humble thinkers
