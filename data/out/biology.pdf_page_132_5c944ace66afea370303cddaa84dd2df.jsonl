Figure 418 Membrane and secretory proteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum RER The
RER also sometimes modifies proteins In this illustration an attachment of a purple carbohydrate modifies a
green integral membrane protein in the ER Vesicles with the integral protein bud from the ER and fuse with the
Golgi apparatus cis face As the protein passes along the Golgis cisternae the addition of more carbohydrates
further modifies it After its synthesis is complete it exits as an integral membrane protein of the vesicle that buds
from the Golgis trans face When the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane the protein becomes an integral
portion of that cell membrane credit modification of work by Magnus Manske
If a peripheral membrane protein were synthesized in the lumen inside of the ER would it end up on the
inside or outside of the plasma membrane
The Endoplasmic Reticulum
The endoplasmic reticulum ER Figure 418 is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules
that collectively modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids However these two functions take place in separate
areas of the ER the rough ER and the smooth ER respectively
We call the ER tubules hollow portion the lumen or cisternal space The ERs membrane which is a phospholipid
bilayer embedded with proteins is continuous with the nuclear envelope
Rough ER
Scientists have named the rough endoplasmic reticulum RER as such because the ribosomes attached to
