How could alternative splicing evolve Introns have a beginning and endingrecognition sequence it is
easy to imagine the failure of the splicing mechanism to identify the end of an intron and instead find the
end of the next intron thus removing two introns and the intervening exon In fact there are mechanisms in
place to prevent such intron skipping but mutations are likely to lead to their failure Such mistakes would
more than likely produce a nonfunctional protein Indeed the cause of many genetic diseases is abnormal
splicing rather than mutations in a coding sequence However alternative splicing could possibly create a
protein variant without the loss of the original protein opening up possibilities for adaptation of the new
variant to new functions Gene duplication has played an important role in the evolution of new functions in
a similar way by providing genes that may evolve without eliminating the original functional protein
Question In the corn snake Pantherophis guttatus there are several different color variants including
amelanistic snakes whose skin patterns display only red and yellow pigments The cause of amelanism in
these snakes was recently identified as the insertion of a transposable element into an intron in the OCA2
oculocutaneous albinism gene How might the insertion of extra genetic material into an intron lead to a
nonfunctional protein

Control of RNA Stability
Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus it is given two protective caps that prevent the ends of the strand
from degrading during its journey 5 and 3 exonucleases can degrade unprotected RNAs The 5 cap which
is placed on the 5 end of the mRNA is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule
GTP The GTP is placed backward on the 5 end of the mRNA so that the 5 carbons of the GTP and the
terminal nucleotide are linked through three phosphates The polyA tail which is attached to the 3 end is
usually composed of a long chain of adenine nucleotides These changes protect the two ends of the RNA from
exonuclease attack
Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled
Each RNA molecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate This rate of decay can influence
how much protein is in the cell If the decay rate is increased the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long
shortening the time available for translation of the mRNA to occur Conversely if the rate of decay is decreased
the mRNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more protein can be translated This rate of decay is
referred to as the RNA stability If the RNA is stable it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm
Binding of proteins to the RNA can also influence its stability Proteins called RNAbinding proteins or RBPs
can bind to the regions of the mRNA just upstream or downstream of the proteincoding region These regions in
the RNA that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions or UTRs They are not introns
those have been removed in the nucleus Rather these are regions that regulate mRNA localization stability
and protein translation The region just before the proteincoding region is called the 5 UTR whereas the region
after the coding region is called the 3 UTR Figure 1612 The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase
or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule depending on the specific RBP that binds
