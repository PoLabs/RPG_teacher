Invasive Species
Invasive species are nonnative organisms that when introduced to an area out of their native range
threaten the ecosystem balance of that habitat Many such species exist in the United States as shown in
Figure 4531 Whether enjoying a forest hike taking a summer boat trip or simply walking down an urban
street you have likely encountered an invasive species
Figure 4531 In the United States invasive species like a purple loosestrife Lythrum salicaria and the b zebra
mussel Dreissena polymorpha threaten certain aquatic ecosystems Some forests are threatened by the spread

borer Agrilus planipennis The f European starling Sturnus vulgaris may compete with native bird species for

One of the many recent proliferations of an invasive species concerns the growth of Asian carp populations
Asian carp were introduced to the United States in the 1970s by fisheries and sewage treatment facilities
that used the fishs excellent filter feeding capabilities to clean their ponds of excess plankton Some of
the fish escaped however and by the 1980s they had colonized many waterways of the Mississippi River
basin including the Illinois and Missouri Rivers
Voracious eaters and rapid reproducers Asian carp may outcompete native species for food potentially
leading to their extinction For example black carp are voracious eaters of native mussels and snails
limiting this food source for native fish species Silver carp eat plankton that native mussels and snails
feed on reducing this food source by a different alteration of the food web In some areas of the
Mississippi River Asian carp species have become the most predominant effectively outcompeting native
fishes for habitat In some parts of the Illinois River Asian carp constitute 95 percent of the communitys
biomass Although edible the fish is bony and not a desired food in the United States Moreover their
presence threatens the native fish and fisheries of the Great Lakes which are important to local economies
and recreational anglers Asian carp have even injured humans The fish frightened by the sound of
approaching motorboats thrust themselves into the air often landing in the boat or directly hitting the
boaters
The Great Lakes and their prized salmon and lake trout fisheries are also being threatened by these invasive
fish Asian carp have already colonized rivers and canals that lead into Lake Michigan One infested
waterway of particular importance is the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Channel the major supply waterway
linking the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River To prevent the Asian carp from leaving the canal a series of
