dramatically reduced In turn they resorted to the strategy of terrorism aimed

Conclusion
Protest and social movements across nineteenthcentury Europe took many 
formsfrom riot to revolutionand were integrated in campaigns for 
numerous causes People across the continent mobilised for inclusion in the 
franchise womens equality or the abolition of slavery Many movements 
were organised to give an expression to the increasingly powerful impulse 
of public opinion with the ambition of lobbying governments to legislate 
and correct perceived wrongs By the 1860s and the emergence of the First 
International the politics of protest embraced a transnational approach which 
underpinned the emergence of socialism as an internationalist idea Violence 
was a dynamic associated with various protests and movements ranging from 
riots to terrorist campaigns Violent action could be popular and spontaneous 
or organised and secretive 
Many social groups were met with resistance from the state and this often 
dictated the form of protest deemed appropriate Yet a compelling aspect of the 
development of the state in nineteenthcentury Europe was its uncanny ability 
to subsume the aims of radicals over time The Chartists campaigned for the 
Peoples Charter six goals relating to radical parliamentary reform While 
these aspirations were derided by conservative opinion during the heyday of 
Chartism in the 1830s and 1840s five of the six had been implemented by the 
British state by 1918 A similar story can be found across Europe especially 
relating to womens rights Thus the success of protest groups should not 
perhaps be judged solely within their own lifespans The foundations of the 
modern liberal and democratic state as well as the concept of transnational 
social activism owe much to campaigners in the nineteenth century
