the dark leaves
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him
freeze where he stood A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered
Then out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the
ground like some stalking beast Harry Malfoy and Fang stood
transfixed The cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head
over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood
AAAAAAAAAARGH
Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted  so did Fang The hooded
figure raised its head and looked right at Harry  unicorn blood was
dribbling down its front It got to its feet and came swiftly toward
Harry  he couldnt move for fear
Then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as
though his scar were on fire Half blinded he staggered backward He
heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over
Harry charging at the figure
The pain in Harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees It took a
minute or two to pass When he looked up the figure had gone A centaur
was standing over him not Ronan or Bane this one looked younger he
had whiteblond hair and a palomino body
Are you all right said the centaur pulling Harry to his feet
Yes  thank you  what was that
The centaur didnt answer He had astonishingly blue eyes like pale
sapphires He looked carefully at Harry his eyes lingering on the scar
that stood out livid on Harrys forehead
You are the Potter boy he said You had better get back to Hagrid
The forest is not safe at this time  especially for you Can you ride
It will be quicker this way
My name is Firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front
legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the
clearing Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees their flanks
