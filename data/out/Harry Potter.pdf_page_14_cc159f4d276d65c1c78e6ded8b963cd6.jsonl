good one There had been a flying motorcycle in it He had a funny
feeling hed had the same dream before
His aunt was back outside the door
Are you up yet she demanded
Nearly said Harry
Well get a move on I want you to look after the bacon And dont you
dare let it burn I want everything perfect on Duddys birthday
Harry groaned
What did you say his aunt snapped through the door
Nothing nothing
Dudleys birthday  how could he have forgotten Harry got slowly out

favorite punching bag was Harry but he couldnt often catch him Harry
didnt look it but he was very fast
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but Harry
had always been small and skinny for his age He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes
of Dudleys and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was Harry
had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes He
wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of
all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose The only thing Harry
liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that
was shaped like a bolt of lightning He had had it as long as he could
remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt
