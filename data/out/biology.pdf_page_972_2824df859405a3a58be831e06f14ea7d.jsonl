Farmers often rotate corn a cereal crop and soy beans a legume planting a field with each crop in
alternate seasons What advantage might this crop rotation confer
Soil bacteria collectively called rhizobia symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures
called nodules in which nitrogen fixation takes place This process entails the reduction of atmospheric
nitrogen to ammonia by means of the enzyme nitrogenase Therefore using rhizobia is a natural and
environmentally friendly way to fertilize plants as opposed to chemical fertilization that uses a nonrenewable
resource such as natural gas Through symbiotic nitrogen fixation the plant benefits from using an endless
source of nitrogen from the atmosphere The process simultaneously contributes to soil fertility because the
plant root system leaves behind some of the biologically available nitrogen As in any symbiosis both organisms
benefit from the interaction the plant obtains ammonia and bacteria obtain carbon compounds generated
through photosynthesis as well as a protected niche in which to grow Figure 3111

Mycorrhizae The Symbiotic Relationship between Fungi and Roots
A nutrient depletion zone can develop when there is rapid soil solution uptake low nutrient concentration low
diffusion rate or low soil moisture These conditions are very common therefore most plants rely on fungi to
facilitate the uptake of minerals from the soil Fungi form symbiotic associations called mycorrhizae with plant
roots in which the fungi actually are integrated into the physical structure of the root The fungi colonize the living
root tissue during active plant growth
Through mycorrhization the plant obtains mainly phosphate and other minerals such as zinc and copper from
the soil The fungus obtains nutrients such as sugars from the plant root Figure 3112 Mycorrhizae help
increase the surface area of the plant root system because hyphae which are narrow can spread beyond the
