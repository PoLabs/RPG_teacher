such as GenBank which is maintained by The National Center for Biotechnology Information A number
of computational tools are available to align and analyze sequences Sophisticated computer analysis
programs determine the percentage of sequence identity or homology Sequence homology can be used
to estimate the evolutionary distance between two DNA sequences and reflect the time elapsed since
the genes separated from a common ancestor Molecular analysis has revolutionized phylogenetic trees
In some cases prior results from morphological studies have been confirmed for example confirming
Amborella trichopoda as the most primitive angiosperm known However some groups and relationships
have been rearranged as a result of DNA analysis
262  Gymnosperms
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the type of seeds produced by gymnosperms as well as other characteristics of gymnosperms

Identify the geological era dominated by the gymnosperms and describe the conditions to which they
were adapted

List the four groups of modernday gymnosperms and provide examples of each

Describe the life cycle of a typical gymnosperm
Gymnosperms meaning naked seeds are a diverse group of seed plants According to the anthophyte
hypothesis the angiosperms are a sister group of one group of gymnosperms the Gnetales which makes
the gymnosperms a paraphyletic group Paraphyletic groups are those in which not all descendants of a single
common ancestor are included in the group However  the netifer hypothesis suggests that the gnetophytes
are sister to the conifers making the gymnosperms monophyletic and sister to the angiosperms Further
molecular and anatomical studies may clarify these relationships Characteristics of the gymnosperms include
naked seeds separate female and male gametes pollination by wind and tracheids which transport water and
solutes in the vascular system
Gymnosperm seeds are not enclosed in an ovary rather they are only partially sheltered by modified leaves
called sporophylls You may recall the term strobilus plural  strobili describes a tight arrangement of
sporophylls around a central stalk as seen in pine cones Some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues
upon maturation The layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the megasporangium and later the embryo is
called the integument
Gymnosperms were the dominant phylum in the Mesozoic era They are adapted to live where fresh water
is scarce during part of the year or in the nitrogenpoor soil of a bog Therefore they are still the prominent
phylum in the coniferous biome or taiga where the evergreen conifers have a selective advantage in cold and
dry weather Evergreen conifers continue low levels of photosynthesis during the cold months and are ready to
take advantage of the first sunny days of spring One disadvantage is that conifers are more susceptible than
deciduous trees to leaf infestations because most conifers do not lose their leaves all at once They cannot
therefore shed parasites and restart with a fresh supply of leaves in spring
The life cycle of a gymnosperm involves alternation of generations with a dominant sporophyte in which
reduced male and female gametophytes reside All gymnosperms are heterosporous The male and female
reproductive organs can form in cones or strobili Male and female sporangia are produced either on the same
plant described as monoecious one home or bisexual or on separate plants referred to as dioecious
two homes or unisexual plants The life cycle of a conifer will serve as our example of reproduction in
gymnosperms
Life Cycle of a Conifer
Pine trees are conifers coniferous  cone bearing and carry both male and female sporophylls on the same
mature sporophyte Therefore they are monoecious plants Like all gymnosperms pines are heterosporous
and generate two different types of spores male microspores and female megaspores Male and female
spores develop in different strobili with small male cones and larger female cones In the male cones or
staminate cones the microsporocytes undergo meiosis and the resultant haploid microspores give rise to male
