ectoderm forms epithelial cells and tissues and neuronal tissues During the formation of the neural system
special signaling molecules called growth factors signal some cells at the edge of the ectoderm to become
epidermis cells The remaining cells in the center form the neural plate If the signaling by growth factors were
disrupted then the entire ectoderm would differentiate into neural tissue
The neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube
as illustrated in Figure 4328 In further development the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal
cord
Figure 4328 The central region of the ectoderm forms the neural tube which gives rise to the brain and the spinal
cord
The mesoderm that lies on either side of the vertebrate neural tube will develop into the various connective
tissues of the animal body A spatial pattern of gene expression reorganizes the mesoderm into groups of cells
called somites with spaces between them The somites illustrated in Figure 4329 will further develop into the
ribs lungs and segmental spine muscle The mesoderm also forms a structure called the notochord which is
rodshaped and forms the central axis of the animal body
