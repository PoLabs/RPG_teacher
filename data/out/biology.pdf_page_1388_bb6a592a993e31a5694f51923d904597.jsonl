Energy Sources
Energy from the sun is captured by green plants algae cyanobacteria and photosynthetic protists These
organisms convert solar energy into the chemical energy needed by all living things Light availability can be an
important force directly affecting the evolution of adaptations in photosynthesizers For instance plants in the
understory of a temperate forest are shaded when the trees above them in the canopy completely leaf out in
the late spring Not surprisingly understory plants have adaptations to successfully capture available light that
passes through the canopy One such adaptation is the rapid growth of spring ephemeral plants such as the
spring beauty Claytonia virginica Figure 448 These spring flowers achieve much of their growth and finish
their life cycle reproduce early in the season before the trees in the canopy develop leaves
Figure 448 The spring beauty is an ephemeral spring plant that flowers early in the spring to avoid competing with
larger forest trees for sunlight credit John Beetham
In aquatic ecosystems the availability of light may be limited because sunlight is absorbed by water plants
suspended particles and resident microorganisms Toward the bottom of a lake pond or ocean there is a zone
that light cannot reach because most wavelengths except for the shortest blues are absorbed by the water
column Photosynthesis cannot take place there and as a result a number of adaptations have evolved that
enable living things to survive without light For instance aquatic plants have photosynthetic tissue near the
surface of the water You can think of the broad floating leaves of a water lilywater lilies cannot survive without
light In environments such as hydrothermal vents some bacteria extract energy from inorganic chemicals
because there is no light for photosynthesis
The availability of nutrients in aquatic systems such as oceans is also an important aspect of energy or
photosynthesis Many organisms sink to the bottom of the ocean when they die in the open water when this
