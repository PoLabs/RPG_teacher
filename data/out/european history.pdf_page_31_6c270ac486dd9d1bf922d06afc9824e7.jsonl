11 IDEAS OF EUROPE
11
half of the fifteenth century the explosive spread of the printing press brought 
about a radical change in the cultural life of many Europeans Printed books 
musical scores and cartographies became more widely accessible facilitating 
an accelerated circulation of ideas and pictures that became entrenched in 
the consciousness of Europeans during the early modern period Through 
the engravings of the German humanist Sebastian Mnster 14881552 or 
the Italian scholar Cesare Ripa 15601622 for example the continent was 
personified In the guise of a woman bearing rich clothing treasures and 
cornucopiae or as an anthropomorphic map a common visual language for the 
idea of Europe was embraced by its own elites To be sure such images were 
not an entirely new construction At the height of the Renaissance different 
influences such as the organicist heritage of Aristotle the physical authority 
of Galen and the monetary propaganda of the Roman Emperor Hadrian had 
laid the foundations for the idea of the corporeality of the continent A telling 
example is the Iberian impact of this mapped Europe during its period of 
universal hegemony There is no doubt that the illustration Europa Regina 
composed by Mnster in 1544 or its derivative Europae descriptio 1587 by the 
Dutch engraver Matthias Quad 15571613 and the version included in the 
book Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae 1587 by the German theologian Heinrich 
Bnting 15451606 were known in the court of Philip II of Habsburg 1527
1598 Michael von Aitzings De Europae Virginis descriptione 1587 is based on 
an unknown Italian design from the 1540s that tried to conflate the Emperor of 
the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spainthe Habsburg ruler Charles V
with Zeus as ruler of Europe and that linked Charles power with the thesis 
of the Holy Roman Empire as the Fifth Empire the continuator of universal 
power of Assyria Persia Macedonia and Rome
In a world in which the new knowledge of the Atlantic the Indian and 
the Pacific Oceans was rapidly codified in increasingly precise maps the 
Central European cosmographers delighted potential buyers of their printing 
plates with the representation of distant African Asian or American lands in 
which Spanish Portuguese French English or Dutch explorers conquerors 
and traders had just arrived but also with classical allegories in the shape of 
anthropomorphic maps Until the great voyages of exploration Europe saw 
itself as the centre of the worldor in fact the worldwith Africa and Asia 
as appendices Since the sixteenth century however it realised that it was a 
relatively small part of an immense wider world inhabited by a multitude of 
nations languages and religions 
Mixing the new geographical images and the fight for global hegemony it 
was not until the period called Pax Hispanica coinciding with the reign of Philip 
III of Habsburg 15781621 that the anthropomorphic idea of Europeand 
the figuration of Hispania as its headbecame firmly established in the work
