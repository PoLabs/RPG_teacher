Harry Neville burst Out the moment he saw the other two I was
trying to find you to warn you I heard Malfoy saying he was going to
catch you he said you had a drag 
Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up but Professor
McGonagall had seen She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert
as she towered over the three of them
I would never have believed it of any of you Mr Filch says you were
up in the astronomy tower Its one oclock in the morning Explain
yourselves
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers
question She was staring at her slippers as still as a statue
I think Ive got a good idea of whats been going on said Professor
McGonagall It doesnt take a genius to work it out You fed Draco
Malfoy some cockandbull story about a dragon trying to get him out of
bed and into trouble Ive already caught him I suppose you think its
funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it too
Harry caught Nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this
wasnt true because Neville was looking stunned and hurt Poor
blundering Neville  Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and
find them in the dark to warn them
Im disgusted said Professor McGonagall Four students out of bed in
one night Ive never heard of such a thing before You Miss Granger I
thought you had more sense As for you Mr Potter I thought Gryffindor
meant more to you than this All three of you will receive detentions 
yes you too Mr Longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around
school at night especially these days its very dangerous  and fifty
points will be taken from Gryffindor
Fifty Harry gasped  they would lose the lead the lead hed won in
the last Quidditch match
Fifty points each said Professor McGonagall breathing heavily
through her long pointed nose
Professor  please
You cant
