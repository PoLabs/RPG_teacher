Determine the Time Spent in CellCycle Stages
Problem How long does a cell spend in interphase compared to each stage of mitosis
Background A prepared microscope slide of whitefish blastula crosssections will show cells arrested in
various stages of the cell cycle Note It is not visually possible to separate the stages of interphase from
each other but the mitotic stages are readily identifiable If 100 cells are examined the number of cells in
each identifiable cellcycle stage will give an estimate of the time it takes for the cell to complete that stage
Problem Statement Given the events included in all of interphase and those that take place in each stage
of mitosis estimate the length of each stage based on a 24hour cell cycle Before proceeding state your
hypothesis
Test your hypothesis Test your hypothesis by doing the following
1
Place a fixed and stained microscope slide of whitefish blastula crosssections under the scanning
objective of a light microscope
2
Locate and focus on one of the sections using the lowpower objective of your microscope Notice that
the section is a circle composed of dozens of closely packed individual cells
3
Switch to the mediumpower objective and refocus With this objective individual cells are clearly
visible but the chromosomes will still be very small
4
Switch to the highpower objective and slowly move the slide left to right and up and down to view
all the cells in the section Figure 109 As you scan you will notice that most of the cells are not
undergoing mitosis but are in the interphase period of the cell cycle

5
Practice identifying the various stages of the cell cycle using the drawings of the stages as a guide
Figure 106
6
Once you are confident about your identification begin to record the stage of each cell you encounter
as you scan left to right and top to bottom across the blastula section
7
Keep a tally of your observations and stop when you reach 100 cells identified
8
The larger the sample size total number of cells counted the more accurate the results If possible
gather and record group data prior to calculating percentages and making estimates
Record your observations Make a table similar to Table 101 within which to record your observations
