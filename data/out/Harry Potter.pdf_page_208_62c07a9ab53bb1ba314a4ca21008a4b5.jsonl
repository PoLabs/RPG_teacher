behind her
Im fine said Harry hardly knowing what he was saying The
unicorns dead Hagrid its in that clearing back there
This is where I leave you Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to
examine the unicorn You are safe now
Harry slid off his back
Good luck Harry Potter said Firenze The planets have been read
wrongly before now even by centaurs I hope this is one of those
times
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving Harry
shivering behind him
Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to
return He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly
shook him awake In a matter of seconds though he was wideeyed as
Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest
Harry couldnt sit down He paced up and down in front of the fire He
was still shaking
Snape wants the stone for Voldemort and Voldemorts waiting in the
forest and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get
rich
Stop saying the name said Ron in a terrified whisper as if he
thought Voldemort could hear them
Harry wasnt listening
Firenze saved me but he shouldnt have done so Bane was furious
he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to
happen They must show that Voldemorts coming back Bane thinks
Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me I suppose thats written
in the stars as well
Will you stop saying the name Ron hissed
So all Ive got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone Harry
