Resting Membrane Potential
A neuron at rest is negatively charged the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than
the outside 70 mV note that this number varies by neuron type and by species This voltage is called the
resting membrane potential it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell
If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the
system would reach equilibrium Because ions cannot simply cross the membrane at will there are different
concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell as shown in Table 351 The difference in the number
of positively charged potassium ions K inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane potential
Figure 3510 When the membrane is at rest K ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net movement with
the concentration gradient The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing
the concentration of cations outside the cell in the extracellular fluid relative to inside the cell in the cytoplasm
The negative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium
ion movement than sodium ion movement In neurons potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations
within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations outside of the cell The cell possesses
potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their concentration gradient
However the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels Therefore
potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in Because more cations are leaving
the cell than are entering this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of
the cell The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential once established
Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings two K ions into the cell while removing three Na ions per ATP
consumed As more cations are expelled from the cell than taken in the inside of the cell remains negatively
charged relative to the extracellular fluid It should be noted that chloride ions Cl tend to accumulate outside
of the cell because they are repelled by negativelycharged proteins within the cytoplasm
