Limitations to the Classic Model
Classical thinking about prokaryotic evolution included in the classic tree model is that species evolve clonally
That is they produce offspring themselves with only random mutations causing the descent into the variety
of modernday and extinct species known to science This view is somewhat complicated in eukaryotes that
reproduce sexually but the laws of Mendelian genetics explain the variation in offspring again to be a result of
a mutation within the species Scientists did not consider the concept of genes transferring between unrelated
species as a possibility until relatively recently Horizontal gene transfer HGT or lateral gene transfer is the
transfer of genes between unrelated species HGT is an everpresent phenomenon with many evolutionists
postulating a major role for this process in evolution thus complicating the simple tree model Genes pass
between species which are only distantly related using standard phylogeny thus adding a layer of complexity to
understanding phylogenetic relationships
The various ways that HGT occurs in prokaryotes is important to understanding phylogenies Although at
present some do not view HGT as important to eukaryotic evolution HGT does occur in this domain as well
Finally as an example of the ultimate gene transfer some scientists have proposed genome fusion theories
between symbiotic or endosymbiotic organisms to explain an event of great importancethe evolution of the
first eukaryotic cell without which humans could not have come into existence
Horizontal Gene Transfer
Horizontal gene transfer HGT is the introduction of genetic material from one species to another species by
mechanisms other than the vertical transmission from parents to offspring These transfers allow even distantly
related species to share genes influencing their phenotypes Scientists believe that HGT is more prevalent in
prokaryotes but that this process transfers only about 2 of the prokaryotic genome Some researchers believe
such estimates are premature we must view the actual importance of HGT to evolutionary processes as a work
in progress As scientists investigate this phenomenon more thoroughly they may reveal more HGT transfer
Many scientists believe that HGT and mutation are especially in prokaryotes a significant source of genetic
variation which is the raw material in the natural selection process These transfers may occur between any two
species that share an intimate relationship Table 201
