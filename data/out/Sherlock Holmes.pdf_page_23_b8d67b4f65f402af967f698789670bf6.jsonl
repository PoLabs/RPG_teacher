The RedHeaded League
Your hands my dear sir Your right hand is quite
a size larger than your left You have worked with it
and the muscles are more developed
Well the snuff then and the Freemasonry
I wont insult your intelligence by telling you how
I read that especially as rather against the strict rules
of your order you use an arcandcompass breastpin
Ah of course I forgot that But the writing
What else can be indicated by that right cuff so
very shiny for ve inches and the left one with the
smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon
the desk
Well but China
The sh that you have tattooed immediately
above your right wrist could only have been done in
China I have made a small study of tattoo marks and
have even contributed to the literature of the subject
That trick of staining the shes scales of a delicate
pink is quite peculiar to China When in addition I
see a Chinese coin hanging from your watchchain
the matter becomes even more simple
Mr Jabez Wilson laughed heavily Well I never
said he I thought at rst that you had done some
thing clever but I see that there was nothing in it
after all
I begin to think Watson said Holmes that I
make a mistake in explaining Omne ignotum pro mag
nico you know and my poor little reputation such
as it is will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid Can
you not nd the advertisement Mr Wilson
Yes I have got it now he answered with his
thick red nger planted halfway down the column
Here it is This is what began it all You just read it
for yourself sir
I took the paper from him and read as follows
To the Redheaded League On ac
count of the bequest of the late Ezekiah
Hopkins of Lebanon Pennsylvania U S
A there is now another vacancy open
which entitles a member of the League to a
salary of 4 a week for purely nominal ser
vices All redheaded men who are sound
in body and mind and above the age of
twentyone years are eligible Apply in
person on Monday at eleven oclock to
Duncan Ross at the ofces of the League
7 Popes Court Fleet Street
What on earth does this mean I ejaculated after
I had twice read over the extraordinary announce
ment
Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was
his habit when in high spirits It is a little off the
beaten track isnt it said he And now Mr Wilson
off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself
your household and the effect which this advertise
ment had upon your fortunes You will rst make a
note Doctor of the paper and the date
It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27 1890 Just
two months ago
Very good Now Mr Wilson
Well it is just as I have been telling you Mr
Sherlock Holmes said Jabez Wilson mopping his
forehead I have a small pawnbrokers business at
Coburg Square near the City Its not a very large
affair and of late years it has not done more than
just give me a living I used to be able to keep two
assistants but now I only keep one and I would have
a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half
wages so as to learn the business
What is the name of this obliging youth asked
Sherlock Holmes
His name is Vincent Spaulding and hes not such
a youth either Its hard to say his age I should not
wish a smarter assistant Mr Holmes and I know very
well that he could better himself and earn twice what
I am able to give him But after all if he is satised
why should I put ideas in his head
Why indeed You seem most fortunate in having
an employee who comes under the full market price
It is not a common experience among employers in
this age I dont know that your assistant is not as
remarkable as your advertisement
Oh he has his faults too said Mr Wilson
Never was such a fellow for photography Snapping
away with a camera when he ought to be improving
his mind and then diving down into the cellar like
a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures That is
his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker
Theres no vice in him
He is still with you I presume
Yes sir He and a girl of fourteen who does a bit
of simple cooking and keeps the place cleanthats
all I have in the house for I am a widower and never
had any family We live very quietly sir the three of
us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our
debts if we do nothing more
