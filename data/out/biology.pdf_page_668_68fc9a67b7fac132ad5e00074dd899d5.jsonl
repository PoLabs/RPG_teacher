chloroplast found in Euglena But these symbiotic associations are not restricted to protists For instance
photosynthetic dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae provide nutrients for the coral polyps Figure 2332 that
house them giving corals a boost of energy to secrete their calcium carbonate skeleton In turn the corals
provide the protist with a protected environment and the compounds needed for photosynthesis This type of
symbiotic relationship is important in nutrientpoor environments Without dinoflagellate symbionts corals lose
algal pigments in a process called coral bleaching and they eventually die This explains why reefbuilding corals
typically do not reside in waters deeper than 20 meters insufficient light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates
to photosynthesize
Figure 2332 Coral with symbiotic dinoflagellates Coral polyps obtain nutrition through a symbiotic relationship with
dinoflagellates
The protists and their products of photosynthesis are essentialdirectly or indirectlyto the survival of
organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals Figure 2333 As primary producers protists feed a large
proportion of the worlds aquatic species On land terrestrial plants serve as primary producers In fact
approximately 25 percent of the worlds photosynthesis is conducted by photosynthetic protists particularly
dinoflagellates diatoms and multicellular algae
