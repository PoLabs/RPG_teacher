of the genomic DNA recruiting of repair enzymes and the triggering of apoptosis 44 The common components of
eukaryotic cell division and binary fission are DNA duplication segregation of duplicated chromosomes and division
of the cytoplasmic contents

the meiotic interphase each chromosome is duplicated The sister chromatids that are formed during synthesis are
held together at the centromere region by cohesin proteins All chromosomes are attached to the nuclear envelope
by their tips As the cell enters prophase I the nuclear envelope begins to fragment and the proteins holding
homologous chromosomes locate each other The four sister chromatids align lengthwise and a protein lattice called
the synaptonemal complex is formed between them to bind them together The synaptonemal complex facilitates
crossover between nonsister chromatids which is observed as chiasmata along the length of the chromosome As
prophase I progresses the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the sister chromatids become free except where
they are attached by chiasmata At this stage the four chromatids are visible in each homologous pairing and are
called a tetrad 21 In metaphase I the homologous chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate In anaphase I the
homologous chromosomes are pulled apart and move to opposite poles Sister chromatids are not separated until
meiosis II The fused kinetochore formed during meiosis I ensures that each spindle microtubule that binds to the
tetrad will attach to both sister chromatids 23 The chromosomes of the individual cannot cross over during meiosis if
the individual cannot make recombination nodules This limits the genetic diversity of the individuals gametes to what
occurs during independent assortment with all daughter cells receiving complete maternal or paternal chromatids
An individual who cannot produce diverse offspring is considered less fit than individuals who do produce diverse
offspring 25 a Crossover occurs in prophase I between nonsister homologous chromosomes Segments of DNA
are exchanged between maternally derived and paternally derived chromosomes and new gene combinations are
formed b Random alignment during metaphase I leads to gametes that have a mixture of maternal and paternal
chromosomes c Fertilization is random in that any two gametes can fuse 27 Sexual reproduction increases the
genetic variation within the population because new individuals are made by randomly combining genetic material
from two parents Because only fit individuals reach sexual maturity and reproduce the overall population tends toward
increasing fitness in its environment However there is always a possibility that the random combination creating the
offsprings genome will actually produce an organism less fit for the environment than its parents were 29 Haploid
dominant organisms undergo sexual reproduction by making a diploid zygote The cells that make the gametes are
derived from haploid cells but the  and  mating types that produce the zygote are randomly combined The zygote
also undergoes meiosis to return to the haploid stage so multiple steps add genetic diversity to haploiddominant
organisms

chance all three plants might have acquired only the dominant gene even if the recessive one is present If the round
pea parent is heterozygous there is a oneeighth probability that a random sample of three progeny peas will all be
round 3 Figure 1212 Half of the female offspring would be heterozygous XWXw with red eyes and half would be
homozygous recessive XwXw with white eyes Half of the male offspring would be hemizygous dominant XWY withe

22 The garden pea is sessile and has flowers that close tightly during selfpollination These features help to
prevent accidental or unintentional fertilizations that could have diminished the accuracy of Mendels data 24 Since
we are calculating the probability of two independent events occurring simultaneously we use the product rule F1
generation Since green seed color is recessive there is a 0 probability that any plants in the F1 generation will have
green round seeds F2 generation The probability of growing an F2 generation plant with green seeds is  while the
probability of growing an F2 generation plant with round seeds is  We can use the product rule to then calculate the

would be designated as A F1 would be all heterozygous Aa with axial phenotype F2 would have possible genotypes of
AA Aa and aa these would correspond to axial axial and terminal phenotypes respectively 28 No males can only
express color blindness They cannot carry it because an individual needs two X chromosomes to be a carrier 30
Considering each gene separately the cross at A will produce offspring of which half are AA and half are Aa B will
produce all Bb C will produce half Cc and half cc Proportions then are 12  1  12 or 14 AABbCc continuing for
the other possibilities yields 14 AABbcc 14 AaBbCc and 14 AaBbcc The proportions therefore are 1111 32 The
