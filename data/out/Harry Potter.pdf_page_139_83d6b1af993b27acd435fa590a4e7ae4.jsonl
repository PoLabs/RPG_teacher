Quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after Snapes
fading footsteps
Hes heading for the third floor Harry said but Ron held up his
hand
Can you smell something
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old
socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean
And then they heard it  a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of
gigantic feet Ron pointed  at the end of a passage to the left
something huge was moving toward them They shrank into the shadows and
watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight
It was a horrible sight Twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite
gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head
perched on top like a coconut It had short legs thick as tree trunks
with flat horny feet The smell coming from it was incredible It was
holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its
arms were so long
The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside It waggled its
long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room
The keys in the lock Harry muttered We could lock it in
Good idea said Ron nervously
They edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasnt
about to come out of it With one great leap Harry managed to grab the
key slam the door and lock it
Yes
Flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but
as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts
stop  a high petrified scream  and it was coming from the chamber
theyd just chained up
Oh no said Ron pale as the Bloody Baron
