private some women left their homes for public professions from which they 
had previously been barred others remained or returned to the private sphere 
but questioned the impositions within it and others experienced the difficulty 
of reconciling both options Women had long been involved with the labour 
market especially during the Industrial Revolution but this period saw 
further massive increases in the degree to which women worked for wages
The new century saw the continuation of the struggle for suffrage a 
mobilisation that brought together women from different backgrounds to fight 
for their citizenship The woman question became a topic that dominated 
public debates and exposed for many housewives the social and legal bases 
of discrimination against their gender Very different kinds of feminism 
represented women in the home and in the factory but the movement suffered 
significant setbacks with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 During 
the war female participation was key to the defence of the nation whether 
it meant safeguarding the family structure at home or working in factories 
to replace men who now fought at the front Women and their labour were 
required in the arms sector in agriculture in banks and so on In addition 
many participated in the war as nurses even at the frontlines of battle As a 
result the work of women inside and outside the home was essential for the 
war effort At the same time this called into question arguments that had been 
used in the past to justify their social and legal discrimination
Female participation in the war effort following years of struggle for 
suffrage precipitated womens securing of the right to vote in many countries 
in the 1920s though this proceeded in parallel with the reinstatement of earlier 
discourses of female domesticity Once their patriotic work was accomplished 
women were effectively told to return home to make way for men returning 
from the front However many women used their experiences to question this 
and to challenge the biological determinism that had until then justified their 
limited access to certain jobs or social functions The rise of fascism though led 
to the strong imposition of a patriarchal model in which women were above all 
mothers and wives With no time to heal the wounds of the First World War 
another conflict broke out in 1939 and women were again incorporated into 
the tasks that men at the front left vacant They also reexperienced like a dj 
vu the contradiction of public policies when as war came to a close in 1945 
governments once again asked them to return to the home as their supposedly 
natural place The postwar home was a mechanised one presenting the 
modern housewife as a fulfilled woman surrounded by washing machines 
and stoves However many women had embarked on a oneway journey 
out of the domestic sphere pursuing higher education and positions of ever 
greater specialisation This situation strengthened the second feminist wave 
in the 1960s which emphasised cultural challenges and the weight of gender
