Lactic Acid Fermentation
The fermentation method used by animals and certain bacteria such as those in yogurt is lactic acid
fermentation Figure 714 This type of fermentation is used routinely in mammalian red blood cells which do
not have mitochondria and in skeletal muscle that has an insufficient oxygen supply to allow aerobic respiration
to continue that is in muscles used to the point of fatigue In muscles lactic acid accumulation must be
removed by the blood circulation and when the lactic acid loses a hydrogen the resulting lactate is brought to
the liver for further metabolism The chemical reactions of lactic acid fermentation are the following
Pyruvic acid  NADH lactic acid  NAD
The enzyme used in this reaction is lactate dehydrogenase LDH The reaction can proceed in either direction
but the reaction from left to right is inhibited by acidic conditions Such lactic acid accumulation was once
believed to cause muscle stiffness fatigue and soreness although more recent research disputes this
hypothesis Once the lactic acid has been removed from the muscle and circulated to the liver it can be
reconverted into pyruvic acid and further catabolized for energy
