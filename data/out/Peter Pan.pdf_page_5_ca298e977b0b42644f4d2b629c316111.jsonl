lagoons flying over it John lived in a boat turned upside down on the
sands Michael in a wigwam Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn
together John had no friends Michael had friends at night Wendy
had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents but on the whole the
Neverlands have a family resemblance and if they stood still in a
row you could say of them that they have each others nose and so
forth On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching
their coracles We too have been there we can still hear the sound of
the surf though we shall land no more
Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most
compact not large and sprawly you know with tedious distances
between one adventure and another but nicely crammed When you
play at it by day with the chairs and tablecloth it is not in the least
alarming but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes
very real That is why there are nightlights
Occasionally in her travels through her childrens minds Mrs
Darling found things she could not understand and of these quite the
most perplexing was the word Peter She knew of no Peter and yet
he was here and there in John and Michaels minds while Wendys
began to be scrawled all over with him The name stood out in bolder
letters than any of the other words and as Mrs Darling gazed she
felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance
Yes he is rather cocky Wendy admitted with regret Her mother
had been questioning her
But who is he my pet
He is Peter Pan you know mother
At first Mrs Darling did not know but after thinking back into her
childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with
the fairies There were odd stories about him as that when children
died he went part of the way with them so that they should not be
frightened She had believed in him at the time but now that she was
married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any
such person
Besides she said to Wendy he would be grown up by this
time
Oh no he isnt grown up Wendy assured her confidently and
he is just my size She meant that he was her size in both mind and
body she didnt know how she knew she just knew it
Mrs Darling consulted Mr Darling but he smiled poohpooh
Mark my words he said it is some nonsense Nana has been
putting into their heads just the sort of idea a dog would have Leave
it alone and it will blow over
But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave
Mrs Darling quite a shock
Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by
them For instance they may remember to mention a week after the
event happened that when they were in the wood they had met their
dead father and had a game with him It was in this casual way that
Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation Some leaves of a
tree had been found on the nursery floor which certainly were not
there when the children went to bed and Mrs Darling was puzzling
over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile
