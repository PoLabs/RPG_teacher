Ethnobotanist
The relatively new field of ethnobotany studies the interaction between a particular culture and the plants
native to the region Seed plants have a large influence on daytoday human life Not only are plants
the major source of food and medicine they also influence many other aspects of society from clothing
to industry The medicinal properties of plants were recognized early on in human cultures From the
mid1900s synthetic chemicals began to supplant plantbased remedies
Pharmacognosy is the branch of pharmacology that focuses on medicines derived from natural sources
With massive globalization and industrialization it is possible that much human knowledge of plants and
their medicinal purposes will disappear with the cultures that fostered them This is where ethnobotanists
come in To learn about and understand the use of plants in a particular culture an ethnobotanist must bring
in knowledge of plant life and an understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures and traditions The
Amazon forest is home to an incredible diversity of vegetation and is considered an untapped resource of
medicinal plants yet both the ecosystem and its indigenous cultures are threatened with extinction
To become an ethnobotanist a person must acquire a broad knowledge of plant biology ecology and
sociology Not only are the plant specimens studied and collected but also the stories recipes and
traditions that are linked to them For ethnobotanists plants are not viewed solely as biological organisms to
be studied in a laboratory but as an integral part of human culture The convergence of molecular biology
anthropology and ecology make the field of ethnobotany a truly multidisciplinary science
Biodiversity of Plants
Biodiversity ensures a resource for new food crops and medicines Plant life balances ecosystems protects
watersheds mitigates erosion moderates our climate and provides shelter for many animal species Threats to
plant diversity however come from many sources The explosion of the human population especially in tropical
countries where birth rates are highest and economic development is in full swing is leading to devastating
human encroachment into forested areas To feed the growing population humans need to obtain arable land
so there has been and continues to be massive clearing of trees The need for more energy to power larger
