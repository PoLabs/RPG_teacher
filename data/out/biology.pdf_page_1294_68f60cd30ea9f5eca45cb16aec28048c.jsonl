Figure 416 The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney The glomerulus and convoluted tubules are located
in the kidney cortex while collecting ducts are located in the pyramids of the medulla credit modification of work
by NIDDK
Which of the following statements about the nephron is false
a
The collecting duct empties into the distal convoluted tubule
b
The Bowmans capsule surrounds the glomerulus
c
The loop of Henle is between the proximal and distal convoluted tubules
d
The loop of Henle empties into the distal convoluted tubule
Renal Corpuscle
The renal corpuscle located in the renal cortex is made up of a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus
and the capsule a cupshaped chamber that surrounds it called the glomerular or Bowmans capsule
Renal Tubule
The renal tubule is a long and convoluted structure that emerges from the glomerulus and can be divided into
three parts based on function The first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule PCT due to its proximity
to the glomerulus it stays in the renal cortex The second part is called the loop of Henle or nephritic loop
because it forms a loop with descending and ascending limbs that goes through the renal medulla The third
part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule DCT and this part is also restricted to the renal
cortex The DCT which is the last part of the nephron connects and empties its contents into collecting ducts
that line the medullary pyramids The collecting ducts amass contents from multiple nephrons and fuse together
as they enter the papillae of the renal medulla
Capillary Network within the Nephron
The capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to
be filtered The branch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole The branch that exits the
glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole Within the glomerulus the network of capillaries is called the
glomerular capillary bed Once the efferent arteriole exits the glomerulus it forms the peritubular capillary
network which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule In cortical nephrons the peritubular
capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT In juxtamedullary nephrons the peritubular capillary network
forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called the vasa recta
