UNIT 3 POWER AND CITIZENSHIP
424
crushing of protest movements and things soon came to a standstill with the 
advent of the Second World War which nevertheless favoured communist
led antifascist resistance The drive for revolutionary change in the post1945 
period was subject to temporal and geographical differences throughout the 
continent The most important change was the impact of institutionalised 
socialism in Central and Eastern Europe where Sovietaligned communist 
parties attempted to control protest at all costs From the mid1950s onwards 
the parallel intervention of the Soviet Union in Hungary and the proliferation 
of antinuclear movements in countries such as West Germany and Britain gave 
rise to a rift between the Old Left and the New Left This would crystallise in 
the student and workers movements of 1968 as well as through the Warsaw 
Pacts intervention in Czechoslovakia
While the idea of introducing state reforms to achieve socialism with a 
human face seemed to vanish at the end of the 1960s new trends such as 
the centrality of human rights came to the fore At the same time protest 
against censorship and the violation of basic human rights in the authoritarian 
European South reached its peak Police violence and state repression especially 
targeting young activists were catalysts of protest for most movements 
of the long 1960s with qualitative differences depending on the context 
Whereas in the West identitybased politics and new social movements such 
as feminism environmentalism and peace movements developed in parallel 
such demands only flourished in the south after the fall of the dictatorships 
in the mid1970s In the 1980s these and other interrelated issues fuelled the 
development of civil society culminating in the 1989 revolutions With the 
end of the Cold War a new set of movements emerged this time focussing on 
the adverse effects of globalisation on democracy
