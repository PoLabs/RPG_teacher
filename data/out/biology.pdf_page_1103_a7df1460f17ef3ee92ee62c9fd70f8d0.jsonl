The autonomic nervous system serves as the relay between the CNS and the internal organs It controls the
lungs the heart smooth muscle and exocrine and endocrine glands The autonomic nervous system controls
these organs largely without conscious control it can continuously monitor the conditions of these different
systems and implement changes as needed Signaling to the target tissue usually involves two synapses a
preganglionic neuron originating in the CNS synapses to a neuron in a ganglion that in turn synapses on the
target organ as illustrated in Figure 3526 There are two divisions of the autonomic nervous system that often
have opposing effects the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system
Sympathetic Nervous System
The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the fight or flight response that occurs when an animal
encounters a dangerous situation One way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when
encountering a snake snake and sympathetic both begin with s Examples of functions controlled by the
sympathetic nervous system include an accelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion These functions help
prepare an organisms body for the physical strain required to escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend
off a predator
Figure 3527 The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems often have opposing effects on target organs
Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord as illustrated in
Figure 3527 The axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic
ganglia the sympathetic ganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord The acetylcholine
activates the postganglionic neurons Postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs
As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test speech or athletic event can attest the effects of the
sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive This is both because one preganglionic neuron synapses
