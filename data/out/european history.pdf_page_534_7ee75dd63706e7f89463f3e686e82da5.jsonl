and its system of seminars were introduced in Austria during the 1850s in 
the midst of the kleindeutschgrodeutsch rivalry Reviews even though their 
primary task was to promote national science and literature were also sites of 
cultural transfer it was through these reviews that French literature influenced 
the famous Viennese Modernism which in turn also via literary reviews 
spread among the South Slav writers of the Habsburg Empire 
Conclusion 
The development of education in the nineteenth century was marked by 
several paradoxes Its expansion at the primary secondary and higher levels 
was accompanied by a large number of social geographical and gender 
inequalities Moreover while the dynamic of knowledge construction was 
largely transnational education remained anchored in national political 
structures that were developing alongside it The humanities were lined up in 
the service of the nationstate yet professionalisation brought about ideas in 
certain disciplines which could contradict nationalist goals Another tension 
within education was economic in nature while the scientific disciplines were 
gradually aspiring to their autonomy and thus defended an ethos of objectivity 
and impartiality they remained strongly influenced by economic interests In 
addition to the universities which were becoming increasingly differentiated 
nonuniversity research institutes were established alongside research and 
development departments in private companies New sectors of industry 
were fostered through the combination of research and industrial production 
Research findings in natural sciences such as physics and chemistry were put 
to economic use on a large scale The expanding statefinanced education 
systems thus became increasingly important for nation society and economy 
Education was both the result of prosperity and its prerequisite Recorded 
from the middle of the century onwards this educational progress was one of 
the drivers of the second industrial revolution The development of education 
thus reinforced an ideology of universal progress but it also enabled new forms 
of domination which meant that in practice large groups such as women or 
colonised subjects remained excluded from this progress
