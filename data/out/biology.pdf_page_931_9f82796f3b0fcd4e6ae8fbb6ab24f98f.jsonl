The epidermis is usually one cell layer thick however in plants that grow in very hot or very cold conditions
the epidermis may be several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from transpiration A waxy
layer known as the cuticle covers the leaves of all plant species The cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from
the leaf surface Other leaves may have small hairs trichomes on the leaf surface Trichomes help to deter
herbivory by restricting insect movements or by storing toxic or badtasting compounds they can also reduce
the rate of transpiration by blocking air flow across the leaf surface Figure 3025

branched trichomes on the leaf of Arabidopsis lyrata and c multibranched trichomes on a mature Quercus marilandica

Below the epidermis of dicot leaves are layers of cells known as the mesophyll or middle leaf The mesophyll
of most leaves typically contains two arrangements of parenchyma cells the palisade parenchyma and spongy
parenchyma Figure 3026 The palisade parenchyma also called the palisade mesophyll has columnshaped
tightly packed cells and may be present in one two or three layers Below the palisade parenchyma are loosely
arranged cells of an irregular shape These are the cells of the spongy parenchyma or spongy mesophyll
The air space found between the spongy parenchyma cells allows gaseous exchange between the leaf and the
outside atmosphere through the stomata In aquatic plants the intercellular spaces in the spongy parenchyma
help the leaf float Both layers of the mesophyll contain many chloroplasts Guard cells are the only epidermal
cells to contain chloroplasts
