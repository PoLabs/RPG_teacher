Multiple Alleles Confer Drug Resistance in the Malaria Parasite
Malaria is a parasitic disease in humans that is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes including
Anopheles gambiae Figure 1210a and is characterized by cyclic high fevers chills flulike symptoms
and severe anemia Plasmodium falciparum and P vivax are the most common causative agents of malaria
and P falciparum is the most deadly Figure 1210b When promptly and correctly treated P falciparum
malaria has a mortality rate of 01 percent However in some parts of the world the parasite has evolved
resistance to commonly used malaria treatments so the most effective malarial treatments can vary by
geographic region

In Southeast Asia Africa and South America P falciparum has developed resistance to the antimalarial
drugs chloroquine mefloquine and sulfadoxinepyrimethamine P falciparum which is haploid during the
life stage in which it is infectious to humans has evolved multiple drugresistant mutant alleles of the dhps
gene Varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are associated with each of these alleles Being haploid P
falciparum needs only one drugresistant allele to express this trait
In Southeast Asia different sulfadoxineresistant alleles of the dhps gene are localized to different
geographic regions This is a common evolutionary phenomenon that occurs because drugresistant
mutants arise in a population and interbreed with other P falciparum isolates in close proximity Sulfadoxine
resistant parasites cause considerable human hardship in regions where this drug is widely used as an
overthecounter malaria remedy As is common with pathogens that multiply to large numbers within an
infection cycle P falciparum evolves relatively rapidly over a decade or so in response to the selective
pressure of commonly used antimalarial drugs For this reason scientists must constantly work to develop
new drugs or drug combinations to combat the worldwide malaria burden

XLinked Traits
In humans as well as in many other animals and some plants the sex of the individual is determined by sex
chromosomes The sex chromosomes are one pair of nonhomologous chromosomes Until now we have only
considered inheritance patterns among nonsex chromosomes or autosomes In addition to 22 homologous
pairs of autosomes human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes whereas human males have
an XY chromosome pair Although the Y chromosome contains a small region of similarity to the X chromosome
so that they can pair during meiosis the Y chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes When
a gene being examined is present on the X chromosome but not on the Y chromosome it is said to be Xlinked
