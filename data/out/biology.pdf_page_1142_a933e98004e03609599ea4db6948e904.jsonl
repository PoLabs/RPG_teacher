Figure 3618 a The human eye is shown in cross section b A blowup shows the layers of the retina
Which of the following statements about the human eye is false
a
Rods detect color while cones detect only shades of gray
b
When light enters the retina it passes the ganglion cells and bipolar cells before reaching
photoreceptors at the rear of the eye
c
The iris adjusts the amount of light coming into the eye
d
The cornea is a protective layer on the front of the eye
The main function of the lens is to focus light on the retina and fovea centralis The lens is dynamic focusing
and refocusing light as the eye rests on near and far objects in the visual field The lens is operated by muscles
that stretch it flat or allow it to thicken changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on
the retina With age comes the loss of the flexibility of the lens and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia
results Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a
different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short For both defects images
in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry Myopia nearsightedness occurs when an eyeball is
elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina In this case images in the distance are blurry but
images nearby are clear
There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina rods and cones named for their general appearance as
illustrated in Figure 3619 Rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina
They detect dim light and are used primarily for peripheral and nighttime vision Cones are weakly photosensitive
and are located near the center of the retina They respond to bright light and their primary role is in daytime
color vision
