Figure 1419 Nucleotide excision repairs thymine dimers When exposed to UV light thymines lying adjacent to each
other can form thymine dimers In normal cells they are excised and replaced
A wellstudied example of mistakes not being corrected is seen in people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa
Figure 1420 Affected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun When individuals
are exposed to UV light pyrimidine dimers especially those of thymine are formed people with xeroderma
pigmentosa are not able to repair the damage These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide
excision repair enzymes whereas in normal individuals the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is
corrected The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA double helix and this may cause problems during
DNA replication People with xeroderma pigmentosa may have a higher risk of contracting skin cancer than
those who dont have the condition
Figure 1420 Xeroderma pigmentosa is a condition in which thymine dimerization from exposure to UV light is not
repaired Exposure to sunlight results in skin lesions credit James Halpern et al
Errors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA Mutations variations in the
nucleotide sequence of a genome can also occur because of damage to DNA Such mutations may be of two
types induced or spontaneous Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals UV
rays xrays or some other environmental agent Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any
environmental agent they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body
Mutations may have a wide range of effects Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair
The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions in which one base is replaced by another These
substitutions can be of two types either transitions or transversions Transition substitution refers to a purine
or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind for example a purine such as adenine may be replaced
