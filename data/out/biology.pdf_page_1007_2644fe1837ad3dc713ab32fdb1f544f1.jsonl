mass known as callus from which individual plantlets begin to grow after a period of time These can be
separated and are first grown under greenhouse conditions before they are moved to field conditions
Plant Life Spans
The length of time from the beginning of development to the death of a plant is called its life span The life cycle
on the other hand is the sequence of stages a plant goes through from seed germination to seed production of
the mature plant Some plants such as annuals only need a few weeks to grow produce seeds and die Other
plants such as the bristlecone pine live for thousands of years Some bristlecone pines have a documented
age of 4500 years Figure 3229 Even as some parts of a plant such as regions containing meristematic
tissuethe area of active plant growth consisting of undifferentiated cells capable of cell divisioncontinue
to grow some parts undergo programmed cell death apoptosis The cork found on stems and the water
conducting tissue of the xylem for example are composed of dead cells

Plant species that complete their lifecycle in one season are known as annuals an example of which is
Arabidopsis or mouseear cress Biennials such as carrots complete their lifecycle in two seasons In a
biennials first season the plant has a vegetative phase whereas in the next season it completes its
reproductive phase Commercial growers harvest the carrot roots after the first year of growth and do not allow
the plants to flower Perennials such as the magnolia complete their lifecycle in two years or more
In another classification based on flowering frequency monocarpic plants flower only once in their lifetime
examples include bamboo and yucca During the vegetative period of their life cycle which may be as long as
120 years in some bamboo species these plants may reproduce asexually and accumulate a great deal of food
material that will be required during their onceinalifetime flowering and setting of seed after fertilization Soon
after flowering these plants die Polycarpic plants form flowers many times during their lifetime Fruit trees such
as apple and orange trees are polycarpic they flower every year Other polycarpic species such as perennials
flower several times during their life span but not each year By this means the plant does not require all its
nutrients to be channelled towards flowering each year
As is the case with all living organisms genetics and environmental conditions have a role to play in determining
how long a plant will live Susceptibility to disease changing environmental conditions drought cold and
competition for nutrients are some of the factors that determine the survival of a plant Plants continue to grow
despite the presence of dead tissue such as cork Individual parts of plants such as flowers and leaves have
different rates of survival In many trees the older leaves turn yellow and eventually fall from the tree Leaf fall is
triggered by factors such as a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency due to shading by upper leaves or oxidative
damage incurred as a result of photosynthetic reactions The components of the part to be shed are recycled
by the plant for use in other processes such as development of seed and storage This process is known as
nutrient recycling
The aging of a plant and all the associated processes is known as senescence which is marked by several
complex biochemical changes One of the characteristics of senescence is the breakdown of chloroplasts which
is characterized by the yellowing of leaves The chloroplasts contain components of photosynthetic machinery
such as membranes and proteins Chloroplasts also contain DNA The proteins lipids and nucleic acids are
