Internal Fertilization
Internal fertilization occurs most often in landbased animals although some aquatic animals also use this
method There are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization In oviparity fertilized
eggs are laid outside the females body and develop there receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a
part of the egg This occurs in most bony fish many reptiles some cartilaginous fish most amphibians two
mammals and all birds Reptiles and insects produce leathery eggs while birds and turtles produce eggs with
high concentrations of calcium carbonate in the shell making them hard Chicken eggs are an example of this
second type
In ovoviparity fertilized eggs are retained in the female but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the
eggs yolk and the young are fully developed when they are hatched This occurs in some bony fish like the
guppy Lebistes reticulatus some sharks some lizards some snakes such as the garter snake Thamnophis
sirtalis some vipers and some invertebrate animals like the Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina
portentosa
In viviparity the young develop within the female receiving nourishment from the mothers blood through
a placenta The offspring develops in the female and is born alive This occurs in most mammals some
cartilaginous fish and a few reptiles
Internal fertilization has the advantage of protecting the fertilized egg from dehydration on land The embryo is
isolated within the female which limits predation on the young Internal fertilization enhances the fertilization of
eggs by a specific male Fewer offspring are produced through this method but their survival rate is higher than
that for external fertilization
The Evolution of Reproduction
Once multicellular organisms evolved and developed specialized cells some also developed tissues and organs
with specialized functions An early development in reproduction occurred in the Annelids These organisms
produce sperm and eggs from undifferentiated cells in their coelom and store them in that cavity When the
coelom becomes filled the cells are released through an excretory opening or by the body splitting open
Reproductive organs evolved with the development of gonads that produce sperm and eggs These cells went
through meiosis an adaption of mitosis which reduced the number of chromosomes in each reproductive cell
by half while increasing the number of cells through cell division
Complete reproductive systems were developed in insects with separate sexes Sperm are made in testes
and then travel through coiled tubes to the epididymis for storage Eggs mature in the ovary When they are
released from the ovary they travel to the uterine tubes for fertilization Some insects have a specialized sac
called a spermatheca which stores sperm for later use sometimes up to a year Fertilization can be timed with
environmental or food conditions that are optimal for offspring survival
Vertebrates have similar structures with a few differences Nonmammals such as birds and reptiles have
a common body opening called a cloaca for the digestive excretory and reproductive systems Coupling
between birds usually involves positioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm
Mammals have separate openings for the systems in the female and a uterus for support of developing offspring
The uterus has two chambers in species that produce large numbers of offspring at a time while species that
produce one offspring such as primates have a single uterus
Sperm transfer from the male to the female during reproduction ranges from releasing the sperm into the watery
environment for external fertilization to the joining of cloaca in birds to the development of a penis for direct
delivery into the females vagina in mammals
