and reconciliation democracy and human rights is a bitter counterpoint to 
the remilitarised and digitalised borders that surround what critics describe

The history of Europes internal and external borders is therefore also 
the history of their simultaneously inclusive and exclusive impulses which

Changing Meanings of Borders
Borders are much more than just a line of division and administrative tool
