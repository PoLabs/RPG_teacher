some stage of its life cycle simple because cell walls were present in their prokaryote precursors However
not enough is known about eukaryotes cell walls and their development to know how much homology exists
between those of prokaryotes and eukaryotes If the last common ancestor could make cell walls it is clear
that this ability must have been lost in many groups
Endosymbiosis and the Evolution of Eukaryotes
Before we discuss the origins of eukaryotes it is first important to understand that all extant eukaryotes are likely
the descendants of a chimeralike organism that was a composite of a host cell and the cells of an alpha
proteobacterium that took up residence inside it This major theme in the origin of eukaryotes is known as
endosymbiosis one cell engulfing another such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells benefit Over
many generations a symbiotic relationship can result in two organisms that depend on each other so completely
that neither could survive on its own Endosymbiotic events likely contributed to the origin of the last common
ancestor of todays eukaryotes and to later diversification in certain lineages of eukaryotes Figure 235 Similar
endosymbiotic associations are not uncommon in living eukaryotes Before explaining this further it is necessary
to consider metabolism in prokaryotes
Prokaryotic Metabolism
Many important metabolic processes arose in prokaryotes however some of these processes such as nitrogen
fixation are never found in eukaryotes The process of aerobic respiration is found in all major lineages
of eukaryotes and it is localized in the mitochondria Aerobic respiration is also found in many lineages of
prokaryotes but it is not present in all of them and a great deal of evidence suggests that such anaerobic
prokaryotes never carried out aerobic respiration nor did their ancestors
While todays atmosphere is about 20 percent molecular oxygen O2 geological evidence shows that it
originally lacked O2 Without oxygen aerobic respiration would not be expected and living things would have
relied on anaerobic respiration or the process of fermentation instead At some point before about 38 billion
years ago some prokaryotes began using energy from sunlight to power anabolic processes that reduce carbon
dioxide to form organic compounds That is they evolved the ability to photosynthesize Hydrogen derived from
various sources was captured using lightpowered reactions to reduce fixed carbon dioxide in the Calvin cycle
The group of Gramnegative bacteria that gave rise to cyanobacteria used water as the hydrogen source and
released O2 as a waste product
Eventually the amount of photosynthetic oxygen built up in some environments to levels that posed a risk to
living organisms since it can damage many organic compounds Various metabolic processes evolved that
protected organisms from oxygen one of which aerobic respiration also generated high levels of ATP It
became widely present among prokaryotes including in a freeliving group we now call alphaproteobacteria
Organisms that did not acquire aerobic respiration had to remain in oxygenfree environments Originally
oxygenrich environments were likely localized around places where cyanobacteria were abundant and active
but by about 2 billion years ago geological evidence shows that oxygen was building up to higher concentrations
in the atmosphere Oxygen levels similar to todays levels only arose within the last 700 million years
Recall that the first fossils that we believe to be eukaryotes date to about 2 billion years old so they seemed
to have evolved and diversified rapidly as oxygen levels were increasing Also recall that all extant eukaryotes
descended from an ancestor with mitochondria These organelles were first observed by light microscopists
in the late 1800s where they appeared to be somewhat wormshaped structures that seemed to be moving
around in the cell Some early observers suggested that they might be bacteria living inside host cells but these
hypotheses remained unknown or rejected in most scientific communities
Endosymbiotic Theory
As cell biology developed in the twentieth century it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles
responsible for producing ATP using aerobic respiration in which oxygen was the final electron acceptor In
the 1960s American biologist Lynn Margulis of Boston University developed the endosymbiotic theory which
states that eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing another one living within another and
coevolving over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such and shared genetic control of a
mutualistic metabolic pathway to produce ATP In 1967 Margulis introduced new data to support her work on the
theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence Although Marguliss work initially was
met with resistance this basic component of this oncerevolutionary hypothesis is now widely accepted with
work progressing on uncovering the steps involved in this evolutionary process and the key players involved
While the metabolic organelles and genes responsible for many energyharvesting processes appear to have
had their origins in bacteria our nuclear genes and the molecular machinery responsible for replication and
