Figure 621 Metabolic pathways are a series of reactions that multiple enzymes catalyze Feedback inhibition where
the pathways end product inhibits an upstream step is an important regulatory mechanism in cells
Producing both amino acids and nucleotides is controlled through feedback inhibition Additionally ATP is an
allosteric regulator of some of the enzymes involved in sugars catabolic breakdown the process that produces
ATP In this way when ATP is abundant the cell can prevent its further production Remember that ATP is an
unstable molecule that can spontaneously dissociate into ADP If too much ATP were present in a cell much of
it would go to waste Alternatively ADP serves as a positive allosteric regulator an allosteric activator for some
of the same enzymes that ATP inhibits Thus when relative ATP levels are high compared to ATP the cell is
triggered to produce more ATP through sugar catabolism
