French Crown led to Louis XVIs decision to convene the EstatesGeneral a 
representative body of the three estates of the kingdom that had last met in 1614 
to acquire its approval for new taxes The judges of Frances most important 
court of law the Parlement de Paris and many members of the First Estate the 
clergy and the Second Estate the nobility insisted that voting should occur 
by estate and not by head This would give an obvious advantage to the clergy 
and the nobility even though the First and Second Estates together consisted 
of just over one percent of the total French population
In What is the Third Estate a popular and fiery pamphlet published in 
January 1789 the nonnoble clergyman Emmanuel Sieys argued forcefully 
against voting by estate in the upcoming EstatesGeneral More importantly 
he attacked the special privileges that members of the First and Second Estates 
enjoyed Public office and many of the top positions in French society were 
open only to those of the first two estates and Sieys was particularly enraged 
by the limitations placed on a persons career based purely on accidents of 
birth He argued that members of the Third Estate performed all of the useful 
work in society but were not recognised for it Whatever your services 
whatever your talents you will only go so far you will go no further It would 
not do for you to be honoured The fundamental social political and legal 
inequalities that were so deeply engrained in early modern society came to 
be seen as suspect by Sieys and many others Ultimately when the Estates
General met in May and June 1789 and Louis XVI insisted on voting by estate 
and not by head the Third Estate and a number of defectors from the First and 
Second refused to comply forming what they called the National Assembly 
This helped transform the ongoing constitutional crisis into a revolution
The assertion in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the 
Citizen drafted at the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789that men 
are born and remain free and equal in rightsis breathtaking in its simplicity 
and scope While the revolutionaries had something much less universal in 
mind than what this statement seems to imply the fundamental change in 
worldview reflected and reinforced in this declaration continues to capture 
our attention and imagination It was a worldhistorical turning point because 
for the first time equality became a grounding principle in a European state 
constitution and thus obtained fundamental political standing Until the 
French Revolution statements of equality mainly pertained to souls before 
God not to human beings in the face of political authority How this volteface 
could have happened has occupied historians for generations as they have 
sought to explain the power that equality acquired by the end of the eighteenth 
century in various long and shortterm developments in the shifting social 
intellectual cultural and political fabric of early modern Europe
