Whos there he shouted I warn you  Im armed
There was a pause Then 
SMASH
The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and
with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway His face was almost
completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled
beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles
under all the hair
The giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just
brushed the ceiling He bent down picked up the door and fitted it
easily back into its frame The noise of the storm outside dropped a
little He turned to look at them all
Couldnt make us a cup o tea could yeh Its not been an easy
journey
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear
Budge up yeh great lump said the stranger
Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching
terrified behind Uncle Vernon
An heres Harry said the giant
Harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the
beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile
Las time I saw you you was only a baby said the giant Yeh look a
lot like yet dad but yehve got yet moms eyes
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise
I demand that you leave at once sit he said You are breaking and
entering
