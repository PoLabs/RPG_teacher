Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of
parchment
When I call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to
be sorted she said Abbott Hannah
A pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the
hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down A moments pause

HUFFLEPUFF shouted the hat
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at
the Hufflepuff table Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving
merrily at her
Bones Susan
HUFFLEPUFF shouted the hat again and Susan scuttled off to sit next
to Hannah
Boot Terry
RAVENCLAW
The table second from the left clapped this time several Ravenclaws
stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them
 Brocklehurst Mandy went to Ravenclaw too but Brown Lavender
became the first new Gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded
with cheers Harry could see Rons twin brothers catcalling
Bulstrode Millicent then became a Slytherin Perhaps it was Harrys
imagination after all hed heard about Slytherin but he thought they
looked like an unpleasant lot He was starting to feel definitely sick
now He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school
He had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but
because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him
