INTRODUCTION 
The World Wide Web keeps evolving  from the early days when we primarily used the internet 
as an information highway to today where it enables our connections with family friends our 
communities and anyone online who shares our interests anywhere in the world It would 
seem almost natural for the next stage of evolution to be an actual immersion of the web 
This is how we identify the metaverse  a place where a persistent virtual world meets virtual 
augmented reality and Web30 
Before we get into the vast technology aspects of the metaverse and the digital economy it is 
vital to highlight some of the key motivating factors behind human needs because ultimately 
this is what will determine the purpose of the technology as an enabler 
Human behaviour and interaction have always been based on four key factors namely social 
experiences knowledge sharing and learning transacting and entertaining or being enter
tained These interactions seldomly occur in isolation In fact we usually experience two or 
three of them simultaneously and it is these key factors that will determine how technology 
will enable our connections
As we enter the next evolution of digital technology there is no doubt that the metaverse will 
be influenced by how we interact behave and choose to represent ourselves in the world 
Augmented and virtual realities are the essential technologies that will shape access to the 
metaverse while integrating real and simulated experiences to fulfil the key factors that motivate 
human connection Opportunities for marketing in the metaverse also open innovation and 
experimentation for brands and users alike
In this chapter we will explore the opportunities that the metaverse presents and its impact on 
marketing and business today As a direct result of how technologies have responded to our 
intrinsic human needs we will also explore how marketers will have to adjust their strategies 
alongside common pitfalls to avoid when using the metaverse for marketing
