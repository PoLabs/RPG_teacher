increasingly required marriages to take place before a priest and in the 
presence of witnesses At the same time they stigmatised extramarital sexual 
intercourse Unmarried women who were pregnant affirmed their good 
faith and honourable status in church courts hoping to obtain marriage and 
recognition for their children They were not always successful Sometimes the 
social pressure was so great that they saw no other way out than to get rid of 
the unwanted newborn 
Unlike in many other parts of the world not much evidence has been found 
for sexselective infanticide or child abandonment in early modern Europe The 
Constitutio Criminalis Carolina 1532 defined infanticide as a crime ordered 
torture for questioning suspects and threatened the death penalty Those who 
had deprived still unbaptised children of the possibility of salvation were to 
be punished severely Thus in the area of the Holy Roman Empire the rules 
for dealing with child murderers were clearly defined Research has found 
different patterns in dealing with suspected child murderers Proceedings 
were not always initiated at all as the evidence was often difficult to produce 
There also seem to have been marked differences between urban and rural and 
Catholic and Protestant areas At the end of the eighteenth century there was 
an increasing number of voices arguing for awareness of the impact of social 
pressures on single women from the lower classes and thus for a reduction of 
the penalty 
Childhood was a concept of growing importance in early modern Europe 
though historians differ in how they assess it Some have argued that 
modern childhood emerged in the transition from the Middle Ages to the 
early modern period or that the sentiment of motherly love was invented 
in the seventeenth century while others point to later changes during the 
Victorian era No matter what position one takes it is clear that something 
indeed changed in the understanding of childhood over the course of the early 
modern period Children started to gain a status of their own no longer seen 
merely as tiny adults but increasingly as innocents in need of protection from 
the adult world particularly from the world of work Education thus took on 
increasing importance Early childhood education was a family affair in this 
period especially for girls from the lower classes who were educated within 
the framework of their families But this period also saw a steady increase in 
schooling often provided by the church Many middleclass boys and even 
some girls were sent to school around age six certainly in Britain but also in 
other parts of Europe Apprentices and periods of servitude long remained 
a normal part of childhood with the guild system creating opportunities for 
parents to outsource the housing and education of their children to a skilled 
master Communal institutions also emphasised the importance of charity and 
education for abandoned children trying to keep boys out of gangs and girls
