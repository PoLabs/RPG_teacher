Intracellular Hormone Receptors
Lipidderived soluble hormones such as steroid hormones diffuse across the membranes of the endocrine
cell Once outside the cell they bind to transport proteins that keep them soluble in the bloodstream At the
target cell the hormones are released from the carrier protein and diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the plasma
membrane of cells The steroid hormones pass through the plasma membrane of a target cell and adhere
to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus The cell signaling pathways induced by
the steroid hormones regulate specific genes on the cells DNA The hormones and receptor complex act as
transcription regulators by increasing or decreasing the synthesis of mRNA molecules of specific genes This
in turn determines the amount of corresponding protein that is synthesized by altering gene expression This
protein can be used either to change the structure of the cell or to produce enzymes that catalyze chemical
reactions In this way the steroid hormone regulates specific cell processes as illustrated in Figure 375
Figure 375 An intracellular nuclear receptor NR is located in the cytoplasm bound to a heat shock protein
HSP Upon hormone binding the receptor dissociates from the heat shock protein and translocates to the
nucleus In the nucleus the hormonereceptor complex binds to a DNA sequence called a hormone response
element HRE which triggers gene transcription and translation The corresponding protein product can then
mediate changes in cell function
Heat shock proteins HSP are so named because they help refold misfolded proteins In response to
increased temperature a heat shock heat shock proteins are activated by release from the NRHSP
complex At the same time transcription of HSP genes is activated Why do you think the cell responds to
a heat shock by increasing the activity of proteins that help refold misfolded proteins
Other lipidsoluble hormones that are not steroid hormones such as vitamin D and thyroxine have receptors
located in the nucleus The hormones diffuse across both the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope then
bind to receptors in the nucleus The hormonereceptor complex stimulates transcription of specific genes
Plasma Membrane Hormone Receptors
Amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipidderived lipidsoluble and therefore
cannot diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer
surface of the plasma membrane via plasma membrane hormone receptors Unlike steroid hormones lipid
insoluble hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they cannot enter the cell and act directly on
DNA Binding of these hormones to a cell surface receptor results in activation of a signaling pathway this
triggers intracellular activity and carries out the specific effects associated with the hormone In this way nothing
