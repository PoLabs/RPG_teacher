share of it he guessed more or less right as you will see Having made up his
mind he crept along as cleverly as he could Hobbits are clever at quietness
especially in woods as I have already told you also Bilbo had slipped on his
ring before he started That is why the spiders neither saw nor heard him coming
He had picked his way stealthily for some distance when he noticed a place
of dense black shadow ahead of him black even for that forest like a patch of
midnight that had never been cleared away As he drew nearer he saw that it was
made by spiderwebs one behind and over and tangled with another Suddenly he
saw too that there were spiders huge and horrible sitting in the branches above
him and ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they should discover him
Standing behind a tree he watched a group of them for some time and then in
the silence and stillness of the wood he realised that these loathsome creatures

nose or a bit of beard or of a hood
To the fattest of these bundles the spider wentIt is poor old Bombur Ill
bet thought Bilboand nipped hard at the nose that stuck out There was a
muffled yelp inside and a toe shot up and kicked the spider straight and hard
There was life in Bombur still There was a noise like the kicking of a flabby
football and the enraged spider fell off the branch only catching itself with its
own thread just in time
The others laughed You were quite right they said the meats alive and
