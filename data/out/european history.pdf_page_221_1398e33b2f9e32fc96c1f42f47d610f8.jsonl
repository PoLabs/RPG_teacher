Modern History ca 15001800

Introduction
Since Aristotle there has been a thread of thought which maintains that the 
way parents and children as well as husbands and wives relate to each other 
forms a subconscious model for political systems serving as the template for 
how the individual relates to authority Whether one subscribes to this view or 
not everyday life and the organisation of society at the family and household 
levels are clearly fundamental to how European societies have functioned over 
time Yet such topics were for a long time neglected by historians who focused 
narrowly on economic and political developments or who relegated them to 
the field of womens history which they treated as separate and nonessential 
When it comes to our historical understanding of family and household a lot 
of what people presume is true of the past is based either on the behaviour of 
elites on portrayals in literature or on ideologically framed older research 
For instance the idea persists that historically girls across Europe married 
universally and usually in their teens or that large family groups were the 
norm for all societies Many of these assumptions however do not stand up 
to scrutiny 
Examining the setup of care duties often associated with female roles in 
society childbearing and rearing housekeeping etc can help us understand 
developments in a given period not just for women themselves but for societies 
as a whole In this subchapter we sketch the most important characteristics 
of family and household in early modern Europe drawing out temporal 
and geographical distinctions where necessary The origin of these regional 
differences is debated with some historians arguing that differences in legal 
systems inheritance regimes or agrarian practices such as the presence or 
absence of certain types of plough technology are at the bottom of these
