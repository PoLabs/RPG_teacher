DensityIndependent Regulation and Interaction with Density
Dependent Factors
Many factors typically physical or chemical in nature abiotic influence the mortality of a population regardless
of its density including weather natural disasters and pollution An individual deer may be killed in a forest
fire regardless of how many deer happen to be in that area Its chances of survival are the same whether the
population density is high or low The same holds true for cold winter weather
In reallife situations population regulation is very complicated and densitydependent and independent factors
can interact A dense population that is reduced in a densityindependent manner by some environmental
factors will be able to recover differently than a sparse population For example a population of deer affected
by a harsh winter will recover faster if there are more deer remaining to reproduce
