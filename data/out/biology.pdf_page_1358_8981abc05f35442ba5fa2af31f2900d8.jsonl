Oogenesis
Oogenesis illustrated in Figure 4313 occurs in the outermost layers of the ovaries As with sperm production
oogenesis starts with a germ cell called an oogonium plural oogonia but this cell undergoes mitosis to
increase in number eventually resulting in up to about one to two million cells in the embryo
Figure 4313 The process of oogenesis occurs in the ovarys outermost layer
The cell starting meiosis is called a primary oocyte as shown in Figure 4313 This cell will start the first meiotic
division and be arrested in its progress in the first prophase stage At the time of birth all future eggs are in
the prophase stage At adolescence anterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a number of follicles
in an ovary This results in the primary oocyte finishing the first meiotic division The cell divides unequally
with most of the cellular material and organelles going to one cell called a secondary oocyte and only one set
of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm going to the other cell This second cell is called a polar
body and usually dies A secondary meiotic arrest occurs this time at the metaphase II stage At ovulation this
secondary oocyte will be released and travel toward the uterus through the oviduct If the secondary oocyte is
fertilized the cell continues through the meiosis II producing a second polar body and a fertilized egg containing
all 46 chromosomes of a human being half of them coming from the sperm
Egg production begins before birth is arrested during meiosis until puberty and then individual cells continue
through at each menstrual cycle One egg is produced from each meiotic process with the extra chromosomes
and chromatids going into polar bodies that degenerate and are reabsorbed by the body
434  Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction
By the end of this chapter you will be able to do the following

Describe the roles of male and female reproductive hormones

Discuss the interplay of the ovarian and menstrual cycles

Describe the process of menopause
The human male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by the interaction of hormones from the
hypothalamus and anterior pituitary with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs In both sexes the
hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland When the reproductive
hormone is required the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropinreleasing hormone GnRH to the anterior
