But that means he and his wife will die wont they
They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then
yes they will die
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harrys face
To one as young as you Im sure it seems incredible but to Nicolas
and Perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long
day After all to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great
adventure You know the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing As
much money and life as you could want The two things most human beings
would choose above all  the trouble is humans do have a knack of
choosing precisely those things that are worst for them Harry lay
there lost for words Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the
ceiling
Sir said Harry Ive been thinking sir  even if the Stones
gone Vol I mean YouKnow Who 
Call him Voldemort Harry Always use the proper name for things Fear
of a name increases fear of the thing itself
Yes sir Well Voldemorts going to try other ways of coming back
isnt he I mean he hasnt gone has he
No Harry he has not He is still out there somewhere perhaps looking
for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killed
He left Quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers
as his enemies Nevertheless Harry while you may only have delayed his
return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to
fight what seems a losing battle next time  and if he is delayed
again and again why he may never return to power
Harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt Then
he said Sir there are some other things Id like to know if you can
tell me things I want to know the truth about
The truth Dumbledore sighed It is a beautiful and terrible thing
and should therefore be treated with great caution However I shall
answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to in which
case I beg youll forgive me I shall not of course lie
