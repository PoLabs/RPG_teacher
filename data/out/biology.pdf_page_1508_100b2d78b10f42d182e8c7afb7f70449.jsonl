Figure 476 In 1980 Luis and Walter Alvarez Frank Asaro and Helen Michels discovered across the world
a spike in the concentration of iridium within the sedimentary layer at the KPg boundary These researchers
hypothesized that this iridium spike was caused by an asteroid impact that resulted in the KPg mass extinction
In the photo the iridium layer is the light band credit USGS
Scientists measured the relative abundance of fern spores above and below the KPg boundary in this rock
sample Which of the following statements most likely represents their findings
a
An abundance of fern spores from several species was found below the KPg boundary but none was
found above
b
An abundance of fern spores from several species was found above the KPg boundary but none was
found below
c
An abundance of fern spores was found both above and below the KPg boundary but only one
species was found below the boundary and many species were found above the boundary
d
Many species of fern spores were found both above and below the boundary but the total number of
spores was greater below the boundary

The Pleistocene Extinction
The Pleistocene Extinction is one of the lesser extinctions and a recent one It is well known that the
North American and to some degree Eurasian megafaunalarge vertebrate animalsdisappeared toward
the end of the last glaciation period The extinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time
period of 1000012000 years ago In North America the losses were quite dramatic and included the woolly
mammoths with an extant population existing until about 4000 years ago in isolation on Wrangel Island
Canada mastodon giant beavers giant ground sloths sabertoothed cats and the North American camel just
to name a few In the early 1900s scientists first suggested the possibility that overhunting caused the rapid
extinction of these large animals Research into this hypothesis continues today
In general the timing of the Pleistocene extinctions correlated with the arrival of paleohumans perhaps as long
as 40000 years ago and not with climatechange events which is the main competing hypothesis for these
extinctions The extinctions began in Australia about 40000 to 50000 years ago just after the arrival of humans
in the area a marsupial lion a giant oneton wombat and several giant kangaroo species disappeared In North
