Figure 918 Cellcell communication enables these a Staphylococcus aureus bacteria to work together to
form a biofilm inside a hospital patients catheter seen here via scanning electron microscopy S aureus is the
main cause of hospitalacquired infections b Hawaiian bobtail squid have a symbiotic relationship with the
bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri The luminescence makes it difficult to see the squid from below because it
effectively eliminates its shadow In return for camouflage the squid provides food for the bacteria Freeliving V
fischeri do not produce luciferase the enzyme responsible for luminescence but V fischeri living in a symbiotic
relationship with the squid do Quorum sensing determines whether the bacteria should produce the luciferase

What advantage might biofilm production confer on the S aureus inside the catheter
Research on the details of quorum sensing has led to advances in growing bacteria for industrial purposes
Recent discoveries suggest that it may be possible to exploit bacterial signaling pathways to control bacterial
growth this process could replace or supplement antibiotics that are no longer effective in certain situations
