31 STATEBUILDING AND NATIONALISM

vast provincial offices often combined administrative and judicial functions 
To make matters more complicated not only the state but also the church 
maintained local representation resulting in many questions being negotiated 
by at least four key actors namely ecclesiastical and secular authorities at the 
local and central levels Recent research into early modern governance has 
also shown that much of this negotiation and everyday interaction on the 
ground was marked less by repression and resistance than it was by pragmatic 
accommodation
The law was a crucial part of early modern statebuilding though it could 
mean several different things at the same time It included the decrees imposed 
by rulers legislatures where they existed or councils in towns and cities To 
make justice more reliable and responsive to local demands some European 
states including PolandLithuania 1588 and Russia 1649 proceeded to 
collect codify and thus also clarify these partly contradictory laws Denmark 
and Norway 1683 and 1687 were the first northwestern European states to 
follow this example Yet while these early legal codes were extensive they 
were very different from modern iterations they were volumes of long only 
partially systematic lists that lacked any sense of legal abstraction Women and 
different categories of unfree peopleincluding serfs and slaves which still 
existed in many European societieshad very limited rights The same went 
for the native populations of the growing imperial and colonial possessions 
held by European states In addition the law could also mean the growing 
body of legal decisions within common law systems such as the one found 
in England Or it could mean the statutes of Roman and Canon law that 
from the Renaissance onward came to be studied and integrated into local 
legal understandings and practice in most of western and southern Europe 
although not so much in northern and eastern Europe 
Finance and Personnel
The business of the state expanded dramatically in early modern Europe 
This business was warfare and its expansion was directly related to the 
military revolution of the earlymodern period From around 1500 the 
number of troops increased rapidly and those troops were taken gradually 
into permanent pay Something similar happened from the midseventeenth 
century with Europes naval forces Thus emerged the socalled fiscalmilitary 
state Medieval states had been financed primarily from the royal domains 
supplemented with incidental contributions from the public negotiated in 
parliamentary sessions but as time went on taxation became as permanent as 
the troops they were paying for In the process states developed new forms 
of taxation and new ways of collecting taxes but also started borrowing large 
sums on the domestic and international capital markets to cover their increased
