The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet
the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he
had pursued the thief had struggled with him they
had each tugged at the coronet their united strength
causing injuries which neither alone could have ef
fected He had returned with the prize but had left a
fragment in the grasp of his opponent So far I was
clear The question now was who was the man and
who was it brought him the coronet
It is an old maxim of mine that when you have
excluded the impossible whatever remains however
improbable must be the truth Now I knew that it
was not you who had brought it down so there only
remained your niece and the maids But if it were
the maids why should your son allow himself to be
accused in their place There could be no possible
reason As he loved his cousin however there was
an excellent explanation why he should retain her
secretthe more so as the secret was a disgraceful
one When I remembered that you had seen her at
that window and how she had fainted on seeing the
coronet again my conjecture became a certainty
And who could it be who was her confederate
A lover evidently for who else could outweigh the
love and gratitude which she must feel to you I
knew that you went out little and that your circle of
friends was a very limited one But among them was
Sir George Burnwell I had heard of him before as
being a man of evil reputation among women It must
have been he who wore those boots and retained the
missing gems Even though he knew that Arthur had
discovered him he might still atter himself that he
was safe for the lad could not say a word without
compromising his own family
Well your own good sense will suggest what
measures I took next I went in the shape of a loafer
to Sir Georges house managed to pick up an acquain
tance with his valet learned that his master had cut
his head the night before and nally at the expense
of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of
his castoff shoes With these I journeyed down to
Streatham and saw that they exactly tted the tracks
I saw an illdressed vagabond in the lane yester
day evening said Mr Holder
Precisely It was I I found that I had my man
so I came home and changed my clothes It was a
delicate part which I had to play then for I saw that
a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and I
knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands
were tied in the matter I went and saw him At rst
of course he denied everything But when I gave him
every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster
and took down a lifepreserver from the wall I knew
my man however and I clapped a pistol to his head
before he could strike Then he became a little more
reasonable I told him that we would give him a price
for the stones he held1000 apiece That brought
out the rst signs of grief that he had shown Why
dash it all said he Ive let them go at six hundred
for the three I soon managed to get the address of
the receiver who had them on promising him that
there would be no prosecution Off I set to him and
after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 pounds
apiece Then I looked in upon your son told him
that all was right and eventually got to my bed about
two oclock after what I may call a really hard days
work
A day which has saved England from a great
public scandal said the banker rising Sir I cannot
nd words to thank you but you shall not nd me
ungrateful for what you have done Your skill has
indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it And now
I must y to my dear boy to apologise to him for the
wrong which I have done him As to what you tell
me of poor Mary it goes to my very heart Not even
your skill can inform me where she is now
I think that we may safely say returned Holmes
that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is It is
equally certain too that whatever her sins are they
will soon receive a more than sufcient punishment
