Introduction
In the nineteenth century the operation of the economy changed fundamentally 
throughout Europe With the process of industrialisation a new age of 
capitalism began merchant capitalism was replaced by industrial capitalism 
characterised by the widespread use of the factory system of manufacturing 
the expansion of mass production the massive use of wage labour the 
worldwide interconnection of markets and the spread of new or renewed 
capitalist institutional frameworks eg company registers jointstock 
companies Although there were significant differences in the characteristics 
of nineteenthcentury capitalism within Europe free competition prevailed as 
a general principle which required the free movement of capital and labour 
the freedom of enterprise the freedom to acquire property and freedom in 
employment All this meant the disappearance of the economic framework 
of the traditional economic system includingfor examplethe abolition of 
guilds and serfdom The nineteenth century was the age of the birth of nation
states but at the same time the economic intervention of the state was mostly 
limited in all Europe European states operated according to the economic 
policy principles of economic liberalism The state played a greater role only 
in certain areas of the economy like building the modern infrastructure and 
in Eastern Europe The volume of trade increased dynamically throughout 
the nineteenth century and in the middle of the century free trade prevailed 
without any customs tariff Although the increasing isolation of national 
customs territories protectionism became more and more characteristic from 
the 1870s onwards the nineteenth century was the era of the first wave of 
economic globalisation Among the complex features of industrial capitalism
