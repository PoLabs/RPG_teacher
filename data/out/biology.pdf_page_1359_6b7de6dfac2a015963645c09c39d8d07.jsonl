pituitary This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone FSH and luteinizing hormone LH from
the anterior pituitary into the blood Note that the body must reach puberty in order for the adrenals to release the
hormones that must be present for GnRH to be produced Although FSH and LH are named after their functions
in female reproduction they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling reproduction
Other hormones have specific functions in the male and female reproductive systems
Male Hormones
At the onset of puberty the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first
time FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative
feedback as illustrated in Figure 4314 LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig
to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood
Testosterone the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during
adolescence stimulates spermatogenesis These secondary sex characteristics include a deepening of the
voice the growth of facial axillary and pubic hair and the beginnings of the sex drive
Figure 4314 Hormones control sperm production in a negative feedback system
A negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and
anterior pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH FSH and LH The Sertoli cells produce the hormone inhibin
which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high This inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH
which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down If the sperm count reaches 20 millionml the Sertoli cells cease
the release of inhibin and the sperm count increases
Female Hormones
The control of reproduction in females is more complex As with the male the anterior pituitary hormones
cause the release of the hormones FSH and LH In addition estrogens and progesterone are released from
the developing follicles Estrogen is the reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth
ovulation and calcium absorption it is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females
These include breast development flaring of the hips and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation
Progesterone assists in endometrial regrowth and inhibition of FSH and LH release
In females FSH stimulates development of egg cells called ova which develop in structures called follicles
Follicle cells produce the hormone inhibin which inhibits FSH production LH also plays a role in the
development of ova induction of ovulation and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the
ovaries Estradiol and progesterone are steroid hormones that prepare the body for pregnancy Estradiol
produces secondary sex characteristics in females while both estradiol and progesterone regulate the menstrual
cycle
The Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle
The ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs while the menstrual
cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining These cycles occur concurrently and are
coordinated over a 2232 day cycle with an average length of 28 days
The first half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase shown in Figure 4315 Slowly rising levels of FSH and
