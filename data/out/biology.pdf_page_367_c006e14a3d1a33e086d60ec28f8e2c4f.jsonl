exhibit the same phenotype as the parent homozygous for the dominant trait If these heterozygous offspring
are selfcrossed the resulting F2 offspring will be equally likely to inherit gametes carrying the dominant or
recessive trait giving rise to offspring of which one quarter are homozygous dominant half are heterozygous
and one quarter are homozygous recessive Because homozygous dominant and heterozygous individuals are
phenotypically identical the observed traits in the F2 offspring will exhibit a ratio of three dominant to one
recessive
Alleles do not always behave in dominant and recessive patterns Incomplete dominance describes situations
in which the heterozygote exhibits a phenotype that is intermediate between the homozygous phenotypes
Codominance describes the simultaneous expression of both of the alleles in the heterozygote Although
diploid organisms can only have two alleles for any given gene it is common for more than two alleles of a
gene to exist in a population In humans as in many animals and some plants females have two X
chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome Genes that are present on the X but not the Y
chromosome are said to be Xlinked such that males only inherit one allele for the gene and females inherit
two Finally some alleles can be lethal Recessive lethal alleles are only lethal in homozygotes but dominant
lethal alleles are fatal in heterozygotes as well
123 Laws of Inheritance
Mendel postulated that genes characteristics are inherited as pairs of alleles traits that behave in a dominant
and recessive pattern Alleles segregate into gametes such that each gamete is equally likely to receive either
one of the two alleles present in a diploid individual In addition genes are assorted into gametes
independently of one another That is alleles are generally not more likely to segregate into a gamete with a
particular allele of another gene A dihybrid cross demonstrates independent assortment when the genes in
question are on different chromosomes or distant from each other on the same chromosome For crosses
involving more than two genes use the forked line or probability methods to predict offspring genotypes and
phenotypes rather than a Punnett square
Although chromosomes sort independently into gametes during meiosis Mendels law of independent
assortment refers to genes not chromosomes and a single chromosome may carry more than 1000 genes
When genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome their alleles tend to be inherited together
This results in offspring ratios that violate Mendels law of independent assortment However recombination
serves to exchange genetic material on homologous chromosomes such that maternal and paternal alleles
may be recombined on the same chromosome This is why alleles on a given chromosome are not always
inherited together Recombination is a random event occurring anywhere on a chromosome Therefore genes
that are far apart on the same chromosome are likely to still assort independently because of recombination
events that occurred in the intervening chromosomal space
Whether or not they are sorting independently genes may interact at the level of gene products such that the
expression of an allele for one gene masks or modifies the expression of an allele for a different gene This is
called epistasis

dominant to wrinkled peas r You do a test cross
between a pea plant with wrinkled peas genotype rr
