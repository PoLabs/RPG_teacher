Anatomy
Lungs Bronchi and Alveoli
The end of the trachea bifurcates divides to the right and left lungs The lungs are not identical The right lung
is larger and contains three lobes whereas the smaller left lung contains two lobes Figure 399 The muscular
diaphragm which facilitates breathing is inferior to below the lungs and marks the end of the thoracic cavity
Figure 399 The trachea bifurcates into the right and left bronchi in the lungs The right lung is made of three lobes
and is larger To accommodate the heart the left lung is smaller and has only two lobes
In the lungs air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages or bronchi Air enters the lungs through the
two primary main bronchi singular bronchus Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi then into
tertiary bronchi which in turn divide creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread
through the lung Like the trachea the bronchi are made of cartilage and smooth muscle At the bronchioles
the cartilage is replaced with elastic fibers Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and
sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction parasympathetic or relaxation sympathetic in
the bronchi and bronchioles depending on the nervous systems cues In humans bronchioles with a diameter
smaller than 05 mm are the respiratory bronchioles They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to
support their shape As the passageways decrease in diameter the relative amount of smooth muscle increases
The terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles The respiratory
bronchioles subdivide into several alveolar ducts Numerous alveoli and alveolar sacs surround the alveolar
ducts The alveolar sacs resemble bunches of grapes tethered to the end of the bronchioles Figure 3910 In
the acinar region the alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each bronchiole At the end of each duct are
approximately 100 alveolar sacs each containing 20 to 30 alveoli that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter Gas
exchange occurs only in alveoli Alveoli are made of thinwalled parenchymal cells typically onecell thick that
