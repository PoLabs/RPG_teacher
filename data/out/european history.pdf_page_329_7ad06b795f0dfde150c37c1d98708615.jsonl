32 EMPIRE AND COLONIALISM

terror But rather than seeing Congo as the exception it can also be seen as 
representative of the exploitative politics of colonialism at large A number 
of recurring themes in the general practice of colonialism can be discerned in 
the particular case of the Congo Free State The exploitative nature of colonial 
rule is the first of these themes At the start of his colonial reign Leopold had 
to promise that the Belgian state would bear no expenses in Congo This is a 
practice that can be observed in other empires as well From 1830 to 1870 the 
Netherlands installed the policy of batig slot positive balance that stipulated 
that each year money had to flow from the Dutch East Indies to the Netherlands 
and not the other way around As some historians have pointed out colonial 
rule was not always profitable The returns on colonial investments were not 
always as high as imagined and sometimes colonies lost money The promise 
of riches however remained an incentive for colonial powers 
A second theme is the structural nature of the economic abuses and the 
farreaching effects they had This was not just excess in the search for profit 
but an effort to reshape economies in the service of imperial powers The 
resulting global economic system chiefly benefitted the West The profitability 
of Congos rubber exploits aside the fact that this resource could flow into 
European markets and was used to manufacture tyres had a positive effect on 
industries well beyond the worth of the rubber industry itself Other colonial 
crops had similar farreaching effects Cotton which by 1831 made up for 
almost a quarter of the annual growth of the economy in Britain reshaped or 
even created entire economies This not only included the plantation economies 
of the Caribbean and later the United States but also countries like Egypt and 
India which were coerced into drastically shifting their domestic agricultural 
sectors to the production of cotton during the nineteenth century In this way 
the countries became connected to a worldwide market but at a high price 
Indias own cotton processing industries were largely destroyed by British 
economic policies Similar instances of deindustrialisation can be discerned 
in other colonies Another effect was that the use of agricultural lands for 
cotton growing often took the place of sustenance farming which made local 
populations vulnerable to capricious global markets
Thirdly while the promise of riches might have been an incentive for the 
colonising powers it would be a mischaracterisation to depict the exploitative 
and extracting colonial politics as an entirely rational affair Deluded notions 
about what constituted progress or modernity were often a determining factor 
Just one instance among many is the failed British introduction of breadfruit 
in the Caribbean which was wrongly believed to be a highly nutritious food 
for the enslaved population but turned out not to be the wonder food British 
colonisers imagined it to be In other instances entire economies were remade
