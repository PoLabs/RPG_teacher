CHAPTER SUMMARY
341 Digestive Systems
Different animals have evolved different types of digestive systems specialized to meet their dietary needs
Humans and many other animals have monogastric digestive systems with a singlechambered stomach Birds
have evolved a digestive system that includes a gizzard where the food is crushed into smaller pieces This
compensates for their inability to masticate Ruminants that consume large amounts of plant material have a
multichambered stomach that digests roughage Pseudoruminants have similar digestive processes as
ruminants but do not have the fourcompartment stomach Processing food involves ingestion eating
digestion mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of large molecules absorption cellular uptake of nutrients
and elimination removal of undigested waste as feces
Many organs work together to digest food and absorb nutrients The mouth is the point of ingestion and the
location where both mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins Saliva contains an enzyme called
amylase that breaks down carbohydrates The food bolus travels through the esophagus by peristaltic
movements to the stomach The stomach has an extremely acidic environment An enzyme called pepsin
digests protein in the stomach Further digestion and absorption take place in the small intestine The large
intestine reabsorbs water from the undigested food and stores waste until elimination
342 Nutrition and Energy Production
Animal diet should be balanced and meet the needs of the body Carbohydrates proteins and fats are the
primary components of food Some essential nutrients are required for cellular function but cannot be produced
by the animal body These include vitamins minerals some fatty acids and some amino acids Food intake in
more than necessary amounts is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells and in fat cells Excess
adipose storage can lead to obesity and serious health problems ATP is the energy currency of the cell and is
obtained from the metabolic pathways Excess carbohydrates and energy are stored as glycogen in the body
343 Digestive System Processes
Digestion begins with ingestion where the food is taken in the mouth Digestion and absorption take place in a
series of steps with special enzymes playing important roles in digesting carbohydrates proteins and lipids
Elimination describes removal of undigested food contents and waste products from the body While most
absorption occurs in the small intestines the large intestine is responsible for the final removal of water that
remains after the absorptive process of the small intestines The cells that line the large intestine absorb some
vitamins as well as any leftover salts and water The large intestine colon is also where feces is formed
344 Digestive System Regulation
The brain and the endocrine system control digestive processes The brain controls the responses of hunger
and satiety The endocrine system controls the release of hormones and enzymes required for digestion of food
in the digestive tract
VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS
1 Figure 3411 Which of the following statements
about the digestive system is false
a
Chyme is a mixture of food and digestive
juices that is produced in the stomach
b
Food enters the large intestine before the
small intestine
c
In the small intestine chyme mixes with bile
which emulsifies fats
d
The stomach is separated from the small
intestine by the pyloric sphincter
2 Figure 3412 Which of the following statements
about the small intestine is false
a
Absorptive cells that line the small intestine
have microvilli small projections that
increase surface area and aid in the
absorption of food
b
The inside of the small intestine has many
folds called villi
c
Microvilli are lined with blood vessels as well
as lymphatic vessels
d
The inside of the small intestine is called the
lumen

about digestive processes is true
