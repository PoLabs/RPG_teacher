Jeanne dArc his famous history of the Maid of Orleans and her holy mission 
It was the defeat of the French Army against Germany in 1870 that turned Joan 
of Arc into a symbol of spiteful patriotism Four years after being brought to 
life by Sarah Bernard at the theatre in 1874 Catholicism seized upon the figure 
of Joan henceforth presenting her as a saint opposing Marianne an abstract 
republican figure adopted by supporters of the Republic since the 1840s After 
1890 clerical and nationalist celebrations of Joan of Arc took root Between the 
two wars she acted as an object of memory for nationalist leagues and has 
more recently been taken up by the far right Mobilising history thus provided 
a way of unifying ones political camp and marshalling ones troops against a 
political opponent
Remembrance policies are by nature conflictual in that they exploit history 
for political ends in order to legitimise the present In the nineteenth century 
historians played a leading role in promoting national memory through 
remembrance In return they benefited from the financial and political 
mobilisation of these projects They thus set themselves up as prophets of the

exercises in commemoration on which it placed excessive value
In the early twentieth century established commemorative practices started 
to decline in certain European societies where political expression was channeled 
through other efforts particularly voting rights strikes and demonstrations 
Equally the historical sciences started criticising the instrumental use of history 
for political ends In democratic societies the subsiding obsession with statues 
did not necessarily indicate a decline in commemorative practices On the 
contrary memory played a discrete yet persistent role in most social activities 
Mass tourism for example paid worship to the past through a passion for 
heritage and the invention of tradition But there was no diminishment in 
authoritarian regimes love of monuments which were deployed with ever 
greater means to mobilise the masses
The Construction of Urban Heritage
The European city provided a crucial setting for furnishing public places with 
tokens of nation building and for the political instrumentalisation of public
