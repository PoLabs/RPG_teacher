63 CENTRES AND PERIPHERIES
787
have tried to challenge pervasive spatial imaginaries such as association of 
centre with metropoles and periphery with the countryside The international 
Cittaslow movement that emerged in Italy in 1999 and which is composed of 
small towns with the aim of promoting slow living may serve as an example 
of these efforts
Conclusion
Centres and peripheries are an analytical tool that needs to be used at 
different scales providing different levels of observation This differentiation 
structures the European continent and its relationship with other continents 
It can also be observed within a region or even within a city between two 
contrasted neighbourhoods Although economic aspects are undoubtedly 
the most relevant for understanding the relations of the centreperiphery 
political cultural and even knowledgebuilding issues are also relevant This 
construction of the world as we see it in centres and peripheries has deep 
consequences in terms of politics or culture How has the habit of Europeans 
to perceive their world in terms of centre and periphery been affected by the 
geopolitical changes of the twentieth century
