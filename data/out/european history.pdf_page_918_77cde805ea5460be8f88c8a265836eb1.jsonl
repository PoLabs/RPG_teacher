that underpinned and enabled the rise of industrial capitalism This modern 
evolving time regime put forward a notion of time as empty and composed 
of uniform and discrete mechanical units This new conceptualisation of 
time could be described as a longlasting process of rationalisation and 
differentiation Other ways of conceptualising time did not vanish and 
these different ways of conceptualising time continued to overlap and colour 
everyday life the reassembly of time was a longlastingsometimes heavily 
opposed or disputedprocess of diffusion adoption and amalgamation 
During the nineteenth century clocktime became dominant and 
formative reconfiguring the temporal order of the modern world even if 
its impact varied in different places and times At the dawn of the twentieth 
century clocktime emerged in many parts of Europe and around the globe 
as a powerful symbol and means not only of temporal but also of political 
and social order According to English historian EP Thompson in its new 
specifically modern understanding time orientation began to interfere with 
task orientation Old polychronic habits were overwhelmed by a newly 
dominant monochronic framing of human behaviour 
This modern understanding of time broke the day and the week down into 
discrete and exclusive temporal segments with different qualities and tasks 
appropriate to each The battlecry of the late nineteenth century moderate 
workingclass movement for eight hours for work eight hours for rest and 
eight hours for what we will makes this temporal demarcation clear Employers 
accepted the separation of time into discrete segments and fought over the 
precise length of time assigned to the working day Here a fundamental aspect 
of the modern European leisure system becomes clear first leisure is a specific 
period of time Second leisuretime is separate from but strongly connected 
to work Third leisure is a distinct period that differs from breaks or time 
dedicated to essential activities such as sleeping and eating Fourth even if 
leisuretime could be imagined as a realm of freedom next to the realm of 
necessities as Karl Marx did in the third volume of Das Kapital published in 
1894 the selfdetermination of time is under siege and colonised from many 
sides Setting distinct boundaries between periods of time marks them both 
Nevertheless these boundaries are always challenged and can become blurred 
Hencefifththe question of how leisure time should be used is contested 
with potential competing uses that include idleness as well as education 
physical and mental health consumption hobbies or selfimprovement A 
history of leisure is therefore not only a history of amusement fun idleness 
the weekend or a growing leisure industry but is equally a history of fierce 
cultural political social and economic struggles over the right or proper 
use and allocation of time for individual men women and children as well as 
society as a whole
