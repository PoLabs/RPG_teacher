Figure 3224 Different types of stems allow for asexual reproduction a The corm of a garlic plant looks similar to b a
tulip bulb but the corm is solid tissue while the bulb consists of layers of modified leaves that surround an underground
stem Both corms and bulbs can selfpropagate giving rise to new plants c Ginger forms masses of stems called
rhizomes that can give rise to multiple plants d Potato plants form fleshy stem tubers Each eye in the stem tuber can
give rise to a new plant e Strawberry plants form stolons stems that grow at the soil surface or just below ground
and can give rise to new plants credit a modification of work by Dwight Sipler credit c modification of work by Albert
