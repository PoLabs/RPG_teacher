21 DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE
141
It is important to note that mortality in general in this period hit children 
and women hardest Women died in childbirth or from postpartum bleeding 
or infections and young children were susceptible to infectious disease 
Conclusion 
At the very end of the early modern period some European countries began to 
experience demographic transitions This was a phenomenon whereby a drop 
in death rates was not immediately followed by a drop in birth rates leading 
to a period of rapid population growth followed by a stabilisation at low levels 
of both birth and death rates However the position from which countries 
started on this process and the speed with which the phenomenon developed 
varied from region to region Fertility and mortality were intrinsically tied 
to developments in standards of living and many periods of early modern 
European history are characterised by Malthusian limitations However 
Europeans were also proactive in limiting fertility and started to live longer 
as incremental advances were made in the science of illness Moreover 
wider societal developments had significant influence on demography with 
secularisation colonisation and protoindustrialisation changing the ways in 
which populations responded to different situations This meant that across 
the continent experiences differed with some countries experiencing the 
start of a socalled youth bulge from the later seventeenth century onwards 
whereas others maintained stable populations with high birth and death rates
Discussion questions
1	
Describe the differences in demographic change between European 
countries in the early modern period
2	
What is the Malthusian model and why was it so influential Is this 
still a good way to think about demographic change
3	
Can we learn anything for today from early modern demographic 
developments
