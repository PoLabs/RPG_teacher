to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature more than 6000 vertebrate species are classified as
threatened Amphibians and mammals are the classes with the greatest percentage of threatened species with
29 percent of all amphibians and 21 percent of all mammals classified as threatened Attempts are being made
around the world to prevent the extinction of threatened species For example the Biodiversity Action Plan is an
international program ratified by 188 countries which is designed to protect species and habitats
291  Chordates
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the distinguishing characteristics of chordates

Identify the derived characters of craniates that sets them apart from other chordates

Describe the developmental fate of the notochord in vertebrates
Vertebrates are members of the kingdom Animalia and the phylum Chordata Figure 292 Recall that animals
that possess bilateral symmetry can be divided into two groupsprotostomes and deuterostomesbased on
their patterns of embryonic development The deuterostomes whose name translates as second mouth
consist of two major phyla Echinodermata and Chordata Echinoderms are invertebrate marine animals that
have pentaradial symmetry and a spiny body covering a group that includes sea stars sea urchins and sea
cucumbers The most conspicuous and familiar members of Chordata are vertebrates but this phylum also
includes two groups of invertebrate chordates
Figure 292 Deuterostome phylogeny All chordates are deuterostomes possessing a notochord at some stage of their
life cycle
Characteristics of Chordata
Animals in the phylum Chordata share five key chacteristics that appear at some stage during their
development a notochord a dorsal hollow tubular nerve cord pharyngeal gill arches or slits a postanal tail
and an endostylethyroid gland Figure 293 In some groups some of these key chacteristics are present only
during embryonic development
The chordates are named for the notochord which is a flexible rodshaped mesodermal structure that is found
in the embryonic stage of all chordates and in the adult stage of some chordate species It is strengthened with
glycoproteins similar to cartilage and covered with a collagenous sheath The notocord is located between the
