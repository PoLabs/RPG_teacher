Figure 3034 The cohesiontension theory of sap ascent is shown Evaporation from the mesophyll cells
produces a negative water potential gradient that causes water to move upwards from the roots through the xylem
Which of the following statements is false
a
Negative water potential draws water into the root hairs Cohesion and adhesion draw water up the
xylem Transpiration draws water from the leaf
b
Negative water potential draws water into the root hairs Cohesion and adhesion draw water up the
phloem Transpiration draws water from the leaf
c
Water potential decreases from the roots to the top of the plant
d
Water enters the plants through root hairs and exits through stoma
Transpirationthe loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomatais a passive process meaning that
metabolic energy in the form of ATP is not required for water movement The energy driving transpiration is the
difference in energy between the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere However transpiration is
tightly controlled
