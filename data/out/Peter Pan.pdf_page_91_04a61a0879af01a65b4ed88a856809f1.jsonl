Chapter XVI
THE RETURN HOME
By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps for
there was a big sea running and Tootles the bosun was among
them with a ropes end in his hand and chewing tobacco They all
donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee shaved smartly and
tumbled up with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers
It need not be said who was the captain Nibs and John were first
and second mate There was a woman aboard The rest were tars
before the mast and lived in the focsle Peter had already lashed
himself to the wheel but he piped all hands and delivered a short
address to them said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant
hearties but that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold
Coast and if they snapped at him he would tear them The bluff
strident words struck the note sailors understood and they cheered
him lustily Then a few sharp orders were given and they turned the
ship round and nosed her for the mainland
Captain Pan calculated after consulting the ships chart that if this
weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June
after which it would save time to fly
Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in
favour of keeping it a pirate but the captain treated them as dogs
and they dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin
Instant obedience was the only safe thing Slightly got a dozen for
looking perplexed when told to take soundings The general feeling
was that Peter was honest just now to lull Wendys suspicions but
that there might be a change when the new suit was ready which
against her will she was making for him out of some of Hooks
wickedest garments It was afterwards whispered among them that
on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with
Hooks cigarholder in his mouth and one hand clenched all but for
the forefinger which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook
Instead of watching the ship however we must now return to that
desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless
flight so long ago It seems a shame to have neglected No 14 all this
time and yet we may be sure that Mrs Darling does not blame us If
we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her she
would probably have cried Dont be silly what do I matter Do go
back and keep an eye on the children So long as mothers are like
this their children will take advantage of them and they may lay to
that
Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its
lawful occupants are on their way home we are merely hurrying on
in advance of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that
Mr and Mrs Darling do not go out for the evening We are no more
than servants Why on earth should their beds be properly aired
