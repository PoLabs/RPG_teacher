seizing her roughly dragged her from the nursery He was ashamed
of himself and yet he did it It was all owing to his too affectionate
nature which craved for admiration When he had tied her up in the
backyard the wretched father went and sat in the passage with his
knuckles to his eyes
In the meantime Mrs Darling had put the children to bed in
unwonted silence and lit their nightlights They could hear Nana
barking and John whimpered It is because he is chaining her up in
the yard but Wendy was wiser
That is not Nanas unhappy bark she said little guessing what
was about to happen that is her bark when she smells danger
Danger
Are you sure Wendy
Oh yes
Mrs Darling quivered and went to the window It was securely
fastened She looked out and the night was peppered with stars
They were crowding round the house as if curious to see what was
to take place there but she did not notice this nor that one or two of
the smaller ones winked at her Yet a nameless fear clutched at her
heart and made her cry Oh how I wish that I wasnt going to a
party tonight
Even Michael already half asleep knew that she was perturbed
and he asked Can anything harm us mother after the nightlights
are lit
Nothing precious she said they are the eyes a mother leaves
behind her to guard her children
She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them and
little Michael flung his arms round her Mother he cried Im glad
of you They were the last words she was to hear from him for a
long time
No 27 was only a few yards distant but there had been a slight
fall of snow and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it
deftly not to soil their shoes They were already the only persons in
the street and all the stars were watching them Stars are beautiful
but they may not take an active part in anything they must just look
on for ever It is a punishment put on them for something they did so
long ago that no star now knows what it was So the older ones have
become glassyeyed and seldom speak winking is the star
language but the little ones still wonder They are not really friendly
to Peter who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and
trying to blow them out but they are so fond of fun that they were on
his side tonight and anxious to get the grownups out of the way So
as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr and Mrs Darling there was a
commotion in the firmament and the smallest of all the stars in the
Milky Way screamed out
Now Peter
