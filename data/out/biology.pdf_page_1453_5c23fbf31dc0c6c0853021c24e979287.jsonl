Although migration is thought of as innate behavior only some migrating species always migrate obligate
migration Animals that exhibit facultative migration can choose to migrate or not Additionally in some animals
only a portion of the population migrates whereas the rest does not migrate incomplete migration For
example owls that live in the tundra may migrate in years when their food source small rodents is relatively
scarce but not migrate during the years when rodents are plentiful
Foraging
Foraging is the act of searching for and exploiting food resources Feeding behaviors that maximize energy
gain and minimize energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors and these are favored by natural
section The painted stork for example uses its long beak to search the bottom of a freshwater marshland for
crabs and other food Figure 4536

Innate Behaviors Living in Groups
Not all animals live in groups but even those that live relatively solitary lives with the exception of those that can
reproduce asexually must mate Mating usually involves one animal signaling another so as to communicate the
desire to mate There are several types of energyintensive behaviors or displays associated with mating called
mating rituals Other behaviors found in populations that live in groups are described in terms of which animal
benefits from the behavior In selfish behavior only the animal in question benefits in altruistic behavior one
animals actions benefit another animal cooperative behavior describes when both animals benefit All of these
behaviors involve some sort of communication between population members
Communication within a Species
Animals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals An example of this is seen in the
threespined stickleback where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to
become aggressive and signals females to mate Other signals are chemical pheromones aural sound visual
courtship and aggressive displays or tactile touch These types of communication may be instinctual or
learned or a combination of both These are not the same as the communication we associate with language
which has been observed only in humans and perhaps in some species of primates and cetaceans
