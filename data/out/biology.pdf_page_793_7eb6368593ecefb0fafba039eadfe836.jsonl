largest mass extinction event in Earths history a loss of an estimated 95 percent of the extant species at that
time Some of the dominant phyla in the worlds oceans such as the trilobites disappeared completely On land
the disappearance of some dominant species of Permian reptiles made it possible for a new line of reptiles
to emerge the dinosaurs The warm and stable climatic conditions of the ensuing Mesozoic Era promoted an
explosive diversification of dinosaurs into every conceivable niche in land air and water Plants too radiated
into new landscapes and empty niches creating complex communities of producers and consumers some of
which became very large on the abundant food available
Another mass extinction event occurred at the end of the Cretaceous period bringing the Mesozoic Era to an
end Skies darkened and temperatures fell after a large meteor impact and tons of volcanic ash ejected into
the atmosphere blocked incoming sunlight Plants died herbivores and carnivores starved and the dinosaurs
ceded their dominance of the landscape to the more warmblooded mammals In the following Cenozoic Era
mammals radiated into terrestrial and aquatic niches once occupied by dinosaurs and birdsthe warmblooded
direct descendants of one line of the ruling reptilesbecame aerial specialists The appearance and dominance
of flowering plants in the Cenozoic Era created new niches for pollinating insects as well as for birds and
mammals Changes in animal species diversity during the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic were also
promoted by a dramatic shift in Earths geography as continental plates slid over the crust into their current
positions leaving some animal groups isolated on islands and continents or separated by mountain ranges
or inland seas from other competitors Early in the Cenozoic new ecosystems appeared with the evolution of
grasses and coral reefs Late in the Cenozoic further extinctions followed by speciation occurred during ice ages
that covered high latitudes with ice and then retreated leaving new open spaces for colonization
