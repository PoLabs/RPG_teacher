three species of orangutan are now listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
IUCN but they are simply the most visible of thousands of species that will not survive the disappearance of
the forests in Sumatra and Borneo The forests are removed for timber and to plant palm oil plantations Figure
4711 Palm oil is used in many products including food products cosmetics and biodiesel in Europe A five
year estimate of global forest cover loss for the years 20002005 was 31 percent In the humid tropics where
forest loss is primarily from timber extraction 272000 km2 was lost out of a global total of 11564000 km2 or
24 percent In the tropics these losses certainly also represent the extinction of species because of high levels
of endemismspecies unique to a defined geographic location and found nowhere else
Figure 4711 a One of three species of orangutan Pongo pygmaeus is found only in the rainforests of Borneo
and an other species of orangutan Pongo abelii is found only in the rainforests of Sumatra These animals are
examples of the exceptional biodiversity of c the islands of Sumatra and Borneo Other species include the b
Sumatran tiger Panthera tigris sumatrae and the d Sumatran elephant Elephas maximus sumatranus both
critically endangered species Rainforest habitat is being removed to make way for e oil palm plantations such as this
