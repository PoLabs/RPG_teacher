The tissues of animals differ from those of the other major multicellular eukaryotes plants and fungi because
their cells dont have cell walls However cells of animal tissues may be embedded in an extracellular matrix
eg mature bone cells reside within a mineralized organic matrix secreted by the cells In vertebrates bone
tissue is a type of connective tissue that supports the entire body structure The complex bodies and activities
of vertebrates demand such supportive tissues Epithelial tissues cover and protect both external and internal
body surfaces and may also have secretory functions Epithelial tissues include the epidermis of the integument
the lining of the digestive tract and trachea as well as the layers of cells that make up the ducts of the liver
and glands of advanced animals for example The different types of tissues in true animals are responsible for
carrying out specific functions for the organism This differentiation and specialization of tissues is part of what
allows for such incredible animal diversity
Just as there are multiple ways to be a eukaryote there are multiple ways to be a multicellular animal The
animal kingdom is currently divided into five monophyletic clades Parazoa or Porifera sponges Placozoa tiny
parasitic creatures that resemble multicellular amoebae Cnidaria jellyfish and their relatives Ctenophora the
comb jellies and Bilateria all other animals The Placozoa flat animal and Parazoa beside animal do not
have specialized tissues derived from germ layers of the embryo although they do possess specialized cells that
act functionally like tissues The Placozoa have only four cell types while the sponges have nearly two dozen
The three other clades do include animals with specialized tissues derived from the germ layers of the embryo In
spite of their superficial similarity to Cnidarian medusae recent molecular studies indicate that the Ctenophores
are only distantly related to the Cnidarians which together with the Bilateria constitute the Eumetazoa true
animals When we think of animals we usually think of Eumetazoa since most animals fall into this category

Animal Reproduction and Development
Most animals are diploid organisms meaning that their body somatic cells are diploid and haploid reproductive
gamete cells are produced through meiosis Some exceptions exist for example in bees wasps and ants the
male is haploid because it develops from unfertilized eggs Most animals undergo sexual reproduction However
a few groups such as cnidarians flatworms and roundworms may also undergo asexual reproduction in which
offspring originate from part of the parental body
Processes of Animal Reproduction and Embryonic Development
During sexual reproduction the haploid gametes of the male and female individuals of a species combine in a
process called fertilization Typically both male and female gametes are required the small motile male sperm
fertilizes the typically much larger sessile female egg This process produces a diploid fertilized egg called a
zygote
Some animal speciesincluding sea stars and sea anemonesare capable of asexual reproduction The most
common forms of asexual reproduction for stationary aquatic animals include budding and fragmentation where
part of a parent individual can separate and grow into a new individual This type of asexual reproduction
produces genetically identical offspring which would appear to be disadvantageous from the perspective of
evolutionary adaptability simply because of the potential buildup of deleterious mutations
In contrast a form of uniparental reproduction found in some insects and a few vertebrates is called
parthenogenesis or virgin beginning In this case progeny develop from a gamete but without fertilization
Because of the nutrients stored in eggs only females produce parthenogenetic offspring In some insects
unfertilized eggs develop into new male offspring This type of sex determination is called haplodiploidy since
females are diploid with both maternal and paternal chromosomes and males are haploid with only maternal
chromosomes A few vertebrates eg some fish turkeys rattlesnakes and whiptail lizards are also capable
of parthenogenesis In the case of turkeys and rattlesnakes parthenogenetically reproducing females also
produce only male offspring but not because the males are haploid In birds and rattlesnakes the female is the
heterogametic ZW sex so the only surviving progeny of postmeiotic parthenogenesis would be ZZ males In
