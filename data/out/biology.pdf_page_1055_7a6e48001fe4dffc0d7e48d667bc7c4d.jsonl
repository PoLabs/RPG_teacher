colon the transverse colon the descending colon and the sigmoid colon The main functions of the colon are
to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food and to store waste material Carnivorous mammals
have a shorter large intestine compared to herbivorous mammals due to their diet
Figure 3413 The large intestine reabsorbs water from undigested food and stores waste material until it is eliminated
Rectum and Anus
The rectum is the terminal end of the large intestine as shown in Figure 3413 The primary role of the rectum
is to store the feces until defecation The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination The
anus is an opening at the farend of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material Two sphincters
between the rectum and anus control elimination the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is
voluntary
Accessory Organs
The organs discussed above are the organs of the digestive tract through which food passes Accessory organs
are organs that add secretions enzymes that catabolize food into nutrients Accessory organs include salivary
glands the liver the pancreas and the gallbladder The liver pancreas and gallbladder are regulated by
hormones in response to the food consumed
The liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays a very important role in digestion of fats and
detoxifying blood The liver produces bile a digestive juice that is required for the breakdown of fatty components
of the food in the duodenum The liver also processes the vitamins and fats and synthesizes many plasma
proteins
The pancreas is another important gland that secretes digestive juices The chyme produced from the stomach
is highly acidic in nature the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate an alkali that neutralizes the
acidic chyme Additionally the pancreatic juices contain a large variety of enzymes that are required for the
digestion of protein and carbohydrates
The gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts When chyme
containing fatty acids enters the duodenum the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum
