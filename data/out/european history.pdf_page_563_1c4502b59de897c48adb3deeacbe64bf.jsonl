44 UNDERSTANDING AND CONTROLLING THE ENVIRONMENT

At the same time views on natural catastrophes and their political prevention 
changed and new protective measures were carried out floods were tempered 
by straightening rivers like the Rhine canalisations were carried out in 
major cities like Hamburg Vienna and London and there were efforts to 
reforest mountains to prevent avalanches in Switzerland A growing amount 
of legislation tried to keep pace with the new needs of capitalism and new 
expectations placed by citizens on national authorities and the ability of 
those authorities to protect citizens and give them new resources developing 
complex schemes and redefining the exact rights of local communities
Industrialisation and the Environment
The industrialisation process in the long nineteenth century had farreaching 
impacts on the natural environment The economic technological and societal 
change from an agrarian to an industrial society marked the transition from 
handmade to machinemade production and led to growing populations 
improving living standards and accelerating national productivity Propelled 
by the invention of steam and combustion engines in the eighteenth century 
as well as the commercial use of electricity at the end of the nineteenth century 
the industrial revolution marked a fundamental turning point in the history of 
the relationship between humans and nature The key element enabling this 
revolution was energy Coal replaced water and wood as the prime energy 
source The exploitation of coal the need for faster transportation systems for 
goods and rapid urbanisationcaused by the influx of rural populations into 
citiesprofoundly transformed the natural environment
British cotton factories and Manchesters bleaching industry the iron steel 
and coke industry in the Ruhr Area and Borsigs MaschinenbauAnstalt zu 
Berlin drained polluted or even poisoned waters in nearby rivers and seas 
or emitted heavily polluted air due to the combustion of coal These hazards 
caused health problems among people and animals living in close proximity 
to industrial areas As a result people started to complain about dirty and foul
smelling water and demanded better protection from the hazards of industrial 
waste However the most common response to such problems was to increase 
the heights of chimneys at factories a solution that limited local contamination 
but spread the toxic fumes to wider areas Environmental problems like the 
socalled smoke pest or smoke plague Rauchplage sulphured air and toxic 
water became vital issues in cities 
Closely related to industrialisation was urbanisation Crowded cities 
in which people had been crammed together to work in factories provided 
fertile ground for pest cholera and other epidemics like typhus Cholera 
outbreaks caused by contaminated water in London in 1854 and Hamburg
