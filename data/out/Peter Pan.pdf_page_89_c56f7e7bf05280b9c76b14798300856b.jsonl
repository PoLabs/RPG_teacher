Now cried all the boys but with a magnificent gesture Peter
invited his opponent to pick up his sword Hook did so instantly but
with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form
Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him but darker
suspicions assailed him now
Pan who and what art thou he cried huskily
Im youth Im joy Peter answered at a venture Im a little bird
that has broken out of the egg
This of course was nonsense but it was proof to the unhappy
Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was which
is the very pinnacle of good form
Tot again he cried despairingly
He fought now like a human flail and every sweep of that terrible
sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed
it but Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him
out of the danger zone And again and again he darted in and
pricked
Hook was fighting now without hope That passionate breast no
longer asked for life but for one boon it craved to see Peter show
bad form before it was cold forever
Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and
fired it
In two minutes he cried the ship will be blown to pieces
Now now he thought true form will show
But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his
hands and calmly flung it overboard
What sort of form was Hook himself showing Misguided man
though he was we may be glad without sympathising with him that
in the end he was true to the traditions of his race The other boys
were flying around him now flouting scornful and he staggered
about the deck striking up at them impotently his mind was no
longer with them it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago
or being sent up for good or watching the wallgame from a famous
wall And his shoes were right and his waistcoat was right and his
tie was right and his socks were right
James Hook thou not wholly unheroic figure farewell
For we have come to his last moment
Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with
dagger poised he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the
sea He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him for we
purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared
him a little mark of respect from us at the end
He had one last triumph which I think we need not grudge him
As he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding
through the air he invited him with a gesture to use his foot It made
Peter kick instead of stab
At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved
Bad form he cried jeeringly and went content to the crocodile
Thus perished James Hook
