on multiple postganglionic neurons amplifying the effect of the original synapse and because the adrenal
gland also releases norepinephrine and the closely related hormone epinephrine into the bloodstream The
physiological effects of this norepinephrine release include dilating the trachea and bronchi making it easier for
the animal to breathe increasing heart rate and moving blood from the skin to the heart muscles and brain
so the animal can think and run The strength and speed of the sympathetic response helps an organism avoid
danger and scientists have found evidence that it may also increase LTPallowing the animal to remember the
dangerous situation and avoid it in the future
Parasympathetic Nervous System
While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations the parasympathetic nervous
system allows an animal to rest and digest One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation
like a picnic the parasympathetic nervous system is in control picnic and parasympathetic both start with
p Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral toward
the bottom spinal cord as shown in Figure 3527 The axons of the preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine
on the postganglionic neurons which are generally located very near the target organs Most postganglionic
neurons release acetylcholine onto target organs although some release nitric oxide
The parasympathetic nervous system resets organ function after the sympathetic nervous system is activated
the common adrenaline dump you feel after a fightorflight event Effects of acetylcholine release on target
organs include slowing of heart rate lowered blood pressure and stimulation of digestion
SensorySomatic Nervous System
The sensorysomatic nervous system is made up of cranial and spinal nerves and contains both sensory and
motor neurons Sensory neurons transmit sensory information from the skin skeletal muscle and sensory
organs to the CNS Motor neurons transmit messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles
to make them contract Without its sensorysomatic nervous system an animal would be unable to process any
information about its environment what it sees feels hears and so on and could not control motor movements
Unlike the autonomic nervous system which has two synapses between the CNS and the target organ sensory
and motor neurons have only one synapseone ending of the neuron is at the organ and the other directly
contacts a CNS neuron Acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter released at these synapses
Humans have 12 cranial nerves nerves that emerge from or enter the skull cranium as opposed to the spinal
nerves which emerge from the vertebral column Each cranial nerve is accorded a name which are detailed in
Figure 3528 Some cranial nerves transmit only sensory information For example the olfactory nerve transmits
information about smells from the nose to the brainstem Other cranial nerves transmit almost solely motor
information For example the oculomotor nerve controls the opening and closing of the eyelid and some eye
movements Other cranial nerves contain a mix of sensory and motor fibers For example the glossopharyngeal
nerve has a role in both taste sensory and swallowing motor
