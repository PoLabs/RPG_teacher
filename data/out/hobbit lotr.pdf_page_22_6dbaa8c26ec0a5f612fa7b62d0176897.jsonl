about this hobbit being fierce but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement
would be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives and kill the lot of us I
think it sounded more like fright than excitement In fact if it had not been for
the sign on the door I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house
As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat I
had my doubts He looks more like a grocer than a burglar
Then Mr Baggins turned the handle and went in The Took side had won He
