opinion indeed had altogether failed to think of something clever
The other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message They all thought
their own shares in the treasure which they quite regarded as theirs in spite of
their plight and the still unconquered dragon would suffer seriously if the
Woodelves claimed part of it and they all trusted Bilbo Just what Gandalf had
said would happen you see Perhaps that was part of his reason for going off and
leaving them
Bilbo however did not feel nearly so hopeful as they did He did not like
being depended on by everyone and he wished he had the wizard at hand But
that was no use probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay between them
He sat and thought and thought until his head nearly burst but no bright idea
would come One invisible ring was a very fine thing but it was not much good
among fourteen But of course as you have guessed he did rescue his friends in
the end and this is how it happened
One day nosing and wandering about Bilbo discovered a very interesting
thing the great gates were not the only entrance to the caves A stream flowed
under part of the lowest regions of the palace and joined the Forest River some
way further to the east beyond the steep slope out of which the main mouth

was a watergate There the rocky roof came down close to the surface of the
stream and from it a portcullis could be dropped right to the bed of the river to
prevent anyone coming in or out that way But the portcullis was often open for
a good deal of traffic went out and in by the watergate If anyone had come in
that way he would have found himself in a dark rough tunnel leading deep into

been cut away and covered with great oaken trapdoors These opened upwards
into the kings cellars There stood barrels and barrels and barrels for the
Woodelves and especially their king were very fond of wine though no vines
grew in those parts The wine and other goods were brought from far away
from their kinsfolk in the South or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands
Hiding behind one of the largest barrels Bilbo discovered the trapdoors and
their use and lurking there listening to the talk of the kings servants he learned
how the wine and other goods came up the rivers or over land to the Long
Lake It seemed a town of Men still throve there built out on bridges far into the
water as a protection against enemies of all sorts and especially against the
dragon of the Mountain From Laketown the barrels were brought up the Forest
River Often they were just tied together like big rafts and poled or rowed up the
