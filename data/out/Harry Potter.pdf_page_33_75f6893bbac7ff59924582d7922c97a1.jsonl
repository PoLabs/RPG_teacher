Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling He was also carrying a long
thin package and didnt answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what hed
bought
Found the perfect place he said Come on Everyone out
It was very cold outside the car Uncle Vernon was pointing at what
looked like a large rock way out at sea Perched on top of the rock was
the most miserable little shack you could imagine One thing was
certain there was no television in there
Storm forecast for tonight said Uncle Vernon gleefully clapping his
hands together And this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his
boat
A toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather
wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the irongray water below
them
Ive already got us some rations said Uncle Vernon so all aboard
It was freezing in the boat Icy sea spray and rain crept down their
necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces After what seemed like
hours they reached the rock where Uncle Vernon slipping and sliding
led the way to the brokendown house
The inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind
whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was
damp and empty There were only two rooms
Uncle Vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four
bananas He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked
and shriveled up
Could do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfully
He was in a very good mood Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance
of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail Harry privately
agreed though the thought didnt cheer him up at all
As night fell the promised storm blew up around them Spray from the
high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the
filthy windows Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second
