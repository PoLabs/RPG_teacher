11 IDEAS OF EUROPE

German Italian and Polish movements that the historian John Breuilly calls 
unification nationalists did not regard one another as rivals Instead they 
tried to cooperate against their most formidable enemies Russia Austria 
and Prussia which in 1815 had formed the Holy Alliance and promoted the 
harsh repression of revolutionary actions and ideas In fact the nationalists 
sometimes claimed to represent a Holy Alliance of the Peoples in opposition 
to the three conservative powers
For many revolutionaries in 1848 nationalist aims and a Europeanist 
movement were not mutually exclusive But there were clashes between 
German mostly liberal nationalists and Poles for instance as well as between 
Germans and Danish nationalliberals The failure of the revolutions of 1848 
however strengthened the argument of those wanting to impose nationalist 
goals over the idea of freedom and European unity Still Mazzini continued 
to speak of Europe  marching by the common consent of her populations 
towards a new era of union and announced the approach of one vast market 
In 1862 the French economist PierreJoseph Proudhon 18061865 attributed 
the failure of the revolutionary movements to the fact that they had combined 
the principles of democracy and nationality Instead Proudhon articulated 
a new idea of European federalism defined as a federation of federations 
of independent communes totally detached from any national principle At 
the same time many of the former revolutionary Europeanist movements 
adopted more conservative doctrines that advanced ideas of supranational 
regions such as the German idea of Mitteleuropa Central Europe or Pan
Slavism and PanLatinism The idea of a PanEurope however did not enjoy 
much support despite the foundation of the monthly journal United States of 
Europe in 1869 by the League of Friends of Freedom and Peace 
An illegal activist for Italian unity in his twenties and later a propagandist 
of transnational nationalism Napoleon III Emperor of the French 18081873 
committed his reign to the replacement of the Vienna states system with one 
based on nationalities To achieve this he waged war in the 1850s against 
Russia and Austria and in the following decade he was mostly supportive 
of the Prussian bid for mastery in Germany In the end however he still 
appreciated the idea of the concert once it was adapted to the new age of 
nationalities it should resurge albeit of course with France as Europes prime 
arbiter
In the end it was Prussian minister president Otto von Bismarck 1815
1898 who profited most from Napoleons ploy He displayed a similarly 
opportunist approach to the Concert of Europe first outmanoeuvring the 
other great powers to the best of his abilities during the three wars of German 
unification and then at times reviving the concert on his own terms to protect 
a status quo that after the establishment of the new Prussianled Kaiserreich 
in 1871 had become very favourable to Germany Thus nineteenthcentury
