Protists do not create food sources only for seadwelling organisms Recall that certain anaerobic parabasalid
species exist in the digestive tracts of termites and woodeating cockroaches where they contribute an essential
step in the digestion of cellulose ingested by these insects as they consume wood
Human Pathogens
As we have seen a pathogen is anything that causes disease Parasitic organisms live in or on a host
organism and harm the organism A small number of protists are serious pathogenic parasites that must
infect other organisms to survive and propagate For example protist parasites include the causative agents
of malaria African sleeping sickness amoebic encephalitis and waterborne gastroenteritis in humans Other
protist pathogens prey on plants effecting massive destruction of food crops
Plasmodium Species
In 2015 WHO reported over 200 million cases of malaria mostly in Africa South America and southern Asia
However it is not well known that malaria was also a prevalent and debilitating disease of the North Central
region of the United States particularly Michigan with its thousands of lakes and numerous swamps Prior to the
civil war and the drainage of many swamps virtually everyone who immigrated to Michigan picked up malaria
