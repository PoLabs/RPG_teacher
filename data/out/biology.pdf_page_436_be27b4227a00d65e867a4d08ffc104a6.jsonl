the polypeptide chain Therefore tRNAs are the molecules that actually translate the language of RNA into the
language of proteins
Of the 64 possible mRNA codonsor triplet combinations of A U G and Cthree specify the termination of
protein synthesis and 61 specify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain Of these 61 one codon
AUG also encodes the initiation of translation Each tRNA anticodon can base pair with one or more of the
mRNA codons for its amino acid For instance if the sequence CUA occurred on an mRNA template in the
proper reading frame it would bind a leucine tRNA expressing the complementary sequence GAU The ability
of some tRNAs to match more than one codon is what gives the genetic code its blocky structure
As the adaptor molecules of translation it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a small
package Consider that tRNAs need to interact with three factors 1 they must be recognized by the correct
aminoacyl synthetase see below 2 they must be recognized by ribosomes and 3 they must bind to the
correct sequence in mRNA
Aminoacyl tRNA Synthetases
The process of pretRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the RNA portion of the adaptor molecule
The corresponding amino acid must be added later once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm
Through the process of tRNA charging each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by one of a
group of enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists
for each of the 20 amino acids the exact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species These
enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP to catalyze a highenergy bond between an amino acid and adenosine
monophosphate AMP a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this reaction The activated amino acid is then
transferred to the tRNA and AMP is released The term charging is appropriate since the highenergy bond
that attaches an amino acid to its tRNA is later used to drive the formation of the peptide bond Each tRNA is
named for its amino acid
The Mechanism of Protein Synthesis
As with mRNA synthesis protein synthesis can be divided into three phases initiation elongation and
termination The process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes Here well explore how
translation occurs in E coli a representative prokaryote and specify any differences between prokaryotic and
eukaryotic translation
Initiation of Translation
Protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex In E coli this complex involves the small
30S ribosome the mRNA template three initiation factors IFs IF1 IF2 and IF3 and a special initiator
tRNA called tRNAMetf
In E coli mRNA a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon called the ShineDalgarno sequence AGGAGG
interacts with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal
subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template Guanosine triphosphate GTP which is a purine
nucleotide triphosphate acts as an energy source during translationboth at the start of elongation and during
the ribosomes translocation Binding of the mRNA to the 30S ribosome also requires IFIII
The initiator tRNA then interacts with the start codon AUG or rarely GUG This tRNA carries the amino
acid methionine which is formylated after its attachment to the tRNA The formylation creates a faux peptide
bond between the formyl carboxyl group and the amino group of the methionine Binding of the fMettRNAMetf
is mediated by the initiation factor IF2 The fMet begins every polypeptide chain synthesized by E coli but
it is usually removed after translation is complete When an inframe AUG is encountered during translation
elongation a nonformylated methionine is inserted by a regular MettRNAMet After the formation of the initiation
complex the 30S ribosomal subunit is joined by the 50S subunit to form the translation complex In eukaryotes
a similar initiation complex forms comprising mRNA the 40S small ribosomal subunit eukaryotic IFs and
nucleoside triphosphates GTP and ATP The methionine on the charged initiator tRNA called MettRNAi is not
formylated However MettRNAi is distinct from other MettRNAs in that it can bind IFs
Instead of depositing at the ShineDalgarno sequence the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the
7methylguanosine cap at the 5 end of the mRNA A capbinding protein CBP and several other IFs assist the
movement of the ribosome to the 5 cap Once at the cap the initiation complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5
to 3 direction searching for the AUG start codon Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG but
this is not always the case According to Kozaks rules the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is
the correct start codon Kozaks rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the AUG
