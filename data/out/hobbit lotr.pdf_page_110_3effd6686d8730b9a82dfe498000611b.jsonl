easy to find there nor food The time is not yet come for nuts though it may be
past and gone indeed before you get to the other side and nuts are about all that
grows there fit for food in there the wild things are dark queer and savage I
will provide you with skins for carrying water and I will give you some bows
and arrows But I doubt very much whether anything you find in Mirkwood will
be wholesome to eat or to drink There is one stream there I know black and
strong which crosses the path That you should neither drink of nor bathe in for
I have heard that it carries enchantment and a great drowsiness and forgetfulness
And in the dim shadows of that place I dont think you will shoot anything
wholesome or unwholesome without straying from the path That you MUST
NOT do for any reason
That is all the advice I can give you Beyond the edge of the forest I cannot
help you much you must depend on your luck and your courage and the food I
send with you At the gate of the forest I must ask you to send back my horse
and my ponies But I wish you all speed and my house is open to you if ever
you come back this way again
They thanked him of course with many bows and sweepings of their hoods and
with many an at your service O master of the wide wooden halls But their
spirits sank at his grave words and they all felt that the adventure was far more
dangerous than they had thought while all the time even if they passed all the
perils of the road the dragon was waiting at the end
All that morning they were busy with preparations Soon after midday they
ate with Beorn for the last time and after the meal they mounted the steeds he
was lending them and bidding him many farewells they rode off through his
gate at a good pace
As soon as they left his high hedges at the east of his fenced lands they turned
north and then bore to the northwest By his advice they were no longer making
for the main forestroad to the south of his land Had they followed the pass
their path would have led them down a stream from the mountains that joined
the great river miles south of the Carrock At that point there was a deep ford
which they might have passed if they had still had their ponies and beyond that
a track led to the skirts of the wood and to the entrance of the old forest road
But Beorn had warned them that that way was now often used by the goblins
while the forestroad itself he had heard was overgrown and disused at the
eastern end and led to impassable marshes where the paths had long been lost
