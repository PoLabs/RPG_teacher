classes usually limited their number of offspring earlier than labouring classes 
In the countryside farmers farm labourers and peasants generally continued 
to have large families and only started decreasing their family size during the 
twentieth century In other words the demographic transition might describe 
an association between decreasing mortality and fertility but hides much 
variation between countries regions and individuals
Industrialisation and Demographic Change
The growth of the population was in its early phase correlated with increasing 
poverty and pauperism that determined the physical conditions of the people 
According to estimations based on military conscriptions there was a decrease 
in the average height of recruits during the first half of the nineteenth century a 
phenomenon carried by the wave of the Industrial Revolution and which went 
hand in hand with accelerating population growth Somehow matters had to 
get worse before living conditions for the population started improving At the 
time this was considered to be the heavy price of the Industrial Revolution 
which the German philosopher and activist Friedrich Engels 18201895 
famously described in 1845 writing that the condition of the workingclass 
 is the highest and most unconcealed pinnacle of the social misery existing 
in our day
The Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century had a similarly 
stimulative impact on population growth in Europe as did proto
industrialisation in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Wage work 
provided resources for an increasing number of households and drew ever
increasing scores of people to the city Urbanisation meant the relocation of large 
numbers of people to hygienically unsatisfactory conditions Cities suffered 
from overcrowding and pollution had limited water supplies and were ideal 
vectors for infectious diseases These poor living circumstances negatively 
affected the health of citydwellers Inhabitants of cities were shorter than their 
counterparts from rural regions or previous generations This situation has 
been best documented for England For example Engels noted that diseases 
of the spine amongst people employed in factories presented themselves very 
frequently to the extent that he had seldom traversed Manchester without 
meeting three or four people suffering from  distortions of the spinal 
columns and legs Statistics paint a similar picture London craftsmen had 
shrunk from an average height of 170 cm in 1750 to 163 cm in 1840 Similarly 
the infant mortality rate rose during the first half of the nineteenth century in 
British industrial cities despite its slow decline during the second half of the 
eighteenth century This confirms the claims of older historiography that the 
standards of living stagnated in the first half of the nineteenth century
