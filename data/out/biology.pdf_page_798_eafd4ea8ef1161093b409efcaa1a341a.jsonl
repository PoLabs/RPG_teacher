CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
19 Why might the evolution of specialized tissues be
important for animal function and complexity
20 Describe and give examples of how humans
display all of the features common to the animal
kingdom
21 How have Hox genes contributed to the diversity
of animal body plans
22 Using the following terms explain what
classifications and groups humans fall into from the
most general to the most specific symmetry germ
layers coelom cleavage embryological
development
23 Explain some of the advantages brought about
through the evolution of bilateral symmetry and
coelom formation
24 Describe at least two major changes to the
animal phylogenetic tree that have come about due
to molecular or genetic findings
25 How is it that morphological data alone might
lead scientists to group animals into erroneous
evolutionary relationships
26 Briefly describe at least two theories that attempt
to explain the cause of the Cambrian explosion
27 How is it that most if not all of the extant animal
phyla today evolved during the Cambrian period if so
many massive extinction events have taken place
since then
