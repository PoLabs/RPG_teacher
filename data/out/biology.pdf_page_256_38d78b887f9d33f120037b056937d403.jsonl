CHAPTER SUMMARY
81 Overview of Photosynthesis
The process of photosynthesis transformed life on Earth By harnessing energy from the sun the evolution of
photosynthesis allowed living things access to enormous amounts of energy Because of photosynthesis living
things gained access to sufficient energy that allowed them to build new structures and achieve the biodiversity
evident today
Only certain organisms photoautotrophs can perform photosynthesis they require the presence of
chlorophyll a specialized pigment that absorbs certain wavelengths of the visible spectrum and can capture
energy from sunlight Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to assemble carbohydrate molecules and
release oxygen as a byproduct into the atmosphere Eukaryotic autotrophs such as plants and algae have
organelles called chloroplasts in which photosynthesis takes place and starch accumulates In prokaryotes
such as cyanobacteria the process is less localized and occurs within folded membranes extensions of the
plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm
82 The LightDependent Reactions of Photosynthesis
The pigments of the first part of photosynthesis the lightdependent reactions absorb energy from sunlight A
photon strikes the antenna pigments of photosystem II to initiate photosynthesis The energy travels to the
reaction center that contains chlorophyll a and then to the electron transport chain which pumps hydrogen ions
into the thylakoid interior This action builds up a high concentration of hydrogen ions The hydrogen ions flow
through ATP synthase during chemiosmosis to form molecules of ATP which are used for the formation of
sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis Photosystem I absorbs a second photon which results
in the formation of an NADPH molecule another energy and reducing carrier for the lightindependent
reactions
