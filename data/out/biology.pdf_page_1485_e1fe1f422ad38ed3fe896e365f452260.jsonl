Figure 4614 Water from the land and oceans enters the atmosphere by evaporation or sublimation where it
condenses into clouds and falls as rain or snow Precipitated water may enter freshwater bodies or infiltrate the soil
The cycle is complete when surface or groundwater reenters the ocean credit modification of work by John M Evans

The Carbon Cycle
Carbon is the second most abundant element in living organisms Carbon is present in all organic molecules
and its role in the structure of macromolecules is of primary importance to living organisms
The carbon cycle is most easily studied as two interconnected subcycles one dealing with rapid carbon
exchange among living organisms and the other dealing with the longterm cycling of carbon through geologic
processes The entire carbon cycle is shown in Figure 4615
