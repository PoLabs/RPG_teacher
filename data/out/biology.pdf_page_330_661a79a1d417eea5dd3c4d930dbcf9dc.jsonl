Figure 119 Fungi such as black bread mold Rhizopus nigricans have a haploid multicellular stage that
produces specialized haploid cells by mitosis that fuse to form a diploid zygote The haploid multicellular stage
produces specialized haploid cells by mitosis that fuse to form a diploid zygote The zygote undergoes meiosis
to produce haploid spores Each spore gives rise to a multicellular haploid organism by mitosis Above different
mating hyphae types denoted as  and  join to form a zygospore through nuclear fusion credit zygomycota

If a mutation occurs so that a fungus is no longer able to produce a minus mating type will it still be able to
reproduce
The third lifecycle type employed by some algae and all plants is a blend of the haploiddominant and
diploiddominant extremes Species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular
organisms as part of their life cycle The haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes because they
produce gametes from specialized cells Meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case
because the organism that produces the gametes is already haploid Fertilization between the gametes forms
a diploid zygote The zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant
called a sporophyte Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores The
spores will subsequently develop into the gametophytes Figure 1110
