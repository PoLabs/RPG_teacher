Figure 1212 Punnett square analysis is used to determine the ratio of offspring from a cross between a redeyed
male fruit fly and a whiteeyed female fruit fly
What ratio of offspring would result from a cross between a whiteeyed male and a female that is
heterozygous for red eye color
Discoveries in fruit fly genetics can be applied to human genetics When a female parent is homozygous for
a recessive Xlinked trait she will pass the trait on to 100 percent of her offspring Her male offspring are
therefore destined to express the trait as they will inherit their fathers Y chromosome In humans the alleles for
certain conditions some forms of color blindness hemophilia and muscular dystrophy are Xlinked Females
who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to be carriers and may not exhibit any phenotypic effects
These females will pass the disease to half of their sons and will pass carrier status to half of their daughters
therefore recessive Xlinked traits appear more frequently in males than females
In some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes the sex with the nonhomologous sex chromosomes is
the female rather than the male This is the case for all birds In this case sexlinked traits will be more likely to
appear in the female in which they are hemizygous
Human Sexlinked Disorders
Sexlinkage studies in Morgans laboratory provided the fundamentals for understanding Xlinked recessive
disorders in humans which include redgreen color blindness and Types A and B hemophilia Because human
males need to inherit only one recessive mutant X allele to be affected Xlinked disorders are disproportionately
observed in males Females must inherit recessive Xlinked alleles from both of their parents in order to express
the trait When they inherit one recessive Xlinked mutant allele and one dominant Xlinked wildtype allele they
are carriers of the trait and are typically unaffected Carrier females can manifest mild forms of the trait due
to the inactivation of the dominant allele located on one of the X chromosomes However female carriers can
contribute the trait to their sons resulting in the son exhibiting the trait or they can contribute the recessive allele
to their daughters resulting in the daughters being carriers of the trait Figure 1213 Although some Ylinked
