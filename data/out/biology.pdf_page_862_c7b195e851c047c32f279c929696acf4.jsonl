Chordates and the Evolution of Vertebrates
Two clades of chordates are invertebrates Cephalochordata and Urochordata Members of these groups also
possess the five distinctive features of chordates at some point during their development
Cephalochordata
Members of Cephalochordata possess a notochord dorsal hollow tubular nerve cord pharyngeal slits
endostylethyroid gland and a postanal tail in the adult stage Figure 294 The notochord extends into the
head which gives the subphylum its name Although the neural tube also extends into the head region there is
no welldefined brain and the nervous system is centered around a hollow nerve cord lying above the notochord
Extinct members of this subphylum include Pikaia which is the oldest known cephalochordate Excellently
preserved Pikaia fossils were recovered from the Burgess shales of Canada and date to the middle of the
Cambrian age making them more than 500 million years old Its anatomy of Pikaia closely resembles that of the
extant lancelet in the genus Branchiostoma
The lancelets are named for their bladelike shape Lancelets are only a few centimeters long and are usually
found buried in sand at the bottom of warm temperate and tropical seas Cephalochordates are suspension
feeders A water current is created by cilia in the mouth and is filtered through oral tentacles Water from the
mouth then enters the pharyngeal slits which filter out food particles The filtered water collects in a gill chamber
called the atrium and exits through the atriopore Trapped food particles are caught in a stream of mucus
produced by the endostyle in a ventral ciliated fold or groove of the pharynx and carried to the gut Most gas
exchange occurs across the body surface Sexes are separate and gametes are released into the water through
the atriopore for external fertilization

head region Adult lancelets retain all five key characteristics of chordates a notochord a dorsal hollow nerve cord

Urochordata
The 1600 species of Urochordata are also known as tunicates Figure 295 The name tunicate derives from
