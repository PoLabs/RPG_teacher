Stromatolites
Fossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on Earth A stromatolite is a sedimentary
structure formed when minerals are precipitated out of water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat Figure 223
Stromatolites form layered rocks made of carbonate or silicate Although most stromatolites are artifacts from the
past there are places on Earth where stromatolites are still forming For example growing stromatolites have
been found in the AnzaBorrego Desert State Park in San Diego County California

stromatolites found in Glacier National Park Montana are nearly 15 billion years old credit a Robert Young credit

The Ancient Atmosphere
Evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earths existence the atmosphere was anoxic
meaning that there was no molecular oxygen Therefore only those organisms that can grow without
oxygenanaerobic organismswere able to live Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical
energy are called phototrophs and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth Then
cyanobacteria also known as bluegreen algae evolved from these simple phototrophs at least one billion
years later It was the ancestral cyanobacteria Figure 224 that began the oxygenation of the atmosphere
Increased atmospheric oxygen allowed the evolution of more efficient O2utilizing catabolic pathways It also
opened up the land to increased colonization because some O2 is converted into O3 ozone and ozone
effectively absorbs the ultraviolet light that could have otherwise caused lethal mutations in DNA The current
evidence suggests that the increase in O2 concentrations allowed the evolution of other life forms
