Figure 4211 Nave CD4 T cells engage MHC II molecules on antigenpresenting cells APCs and become
activated Clones of the activated helper T cell in turn activate B cells and CD8 T cells which become cytotoxic
T cells Cytotoxic T cells kill infected cells
Which of the following statements about T cells is false
a
Helper T cells release cytokines while cytotoxic T cells kill the infected cell
b
Helper T cells are CD4 while cytotoxic T cells are CD8
c
MHC II is a receptor found on most body cells while MHC I is a receptor found on immune cells only
d
The T cell receptor is found on both CD4 and CD8 T cells
Consider the innumerable possible antigens that an individual will be exposed to during a lifetime The
mammalian adaptive immune system is adept in responding appropriately to each antigen Mammals have
an enormous diversity of T cell populations resulting from the diversity of TCRs Each TCR consists of two
polypeptide chains that span the T cell membrane as illustrated in Figure 4212 the chains are linked by a
disulfide bridge Each polypeptide chain is comprised of a constant domain and a variable domain a domain
in this sense is a specific region of a protein that may be regulatory or structural The intracellular domain is
involved in intracellular signaling A single T cell will express thousands of identical copies of one specific TCR
variant on its cell surface The specificity of the adaptive immune system occurs because it synthesizes millions
of different T cell populations each expressing a TCR that differs in its variable domain This TCR diversity is
achieved by the mutation and recombination of genes that encode these receptors in stem cell precursors of T
cells The binding between an antigendisplaying MHC molecule and a complementary TCR match indicates
that the adaptive immune system needs to activate and produce that specific T cell because its structure is
appropriate to recognize and destroy the invading pathogen
