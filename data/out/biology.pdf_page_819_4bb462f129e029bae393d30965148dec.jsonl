and a single testis Many rotifer species exhibit haplodiploidy a method of sex determination in which a fertilized
egg develops into a female and an unfertilized egg develops into a male However reproduction in the bdelloid
rotifers is exclusively parthenogenetic and appears to have been so for millions of years Thus all bdelloid
rotifers and their progeny are female The bdelloids may compensate for this genetic insularity by borrowing
genes from the DNA of other species Up to 10 of a bdelloid genome comprises genes imported from
related species Some rotifer eggs are capable of extended dormancy for protection during harsh environmental
conditions

Phylum Nemertea
The Nemertea are colloquially known as ribbon worms or proboscis worms Most species of phylum Nemertea
are marine and predominantly benthic bottom dwellers with an estimated 900 known species However
nemerteans have been recorded in freshwater and very damp terrestrial habitats as well Most nemerteans
are carnivores feeding on worms clams and crustaceans Some species are scavengers and some like
Malacobdella grossa have also evolved commensal relationships with mollusks Economically important
species have at times devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs Nemerteans have almost no predators
and two species are sold as fish bait
Morphology
Nemerteans vary in size from 1 cm to several meters They show bilateral symmetry and remarkable contractile
properties Because of their contractility they can change their morphological presentation in response to
environmental cues Animals in phylum Nemertea are soft and unsegmented animals with a morphology like a
flattened tube Figure 2819
