Hes just made that rule up Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped
away Wonder whats wrong with his leg
Dunno but I hope its really hurting him said Ron bitterly
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening Harry Ron and
Hermione sat together next to a window Hermione was checking Harry and
Rons Charms homework for them She would never let them copy How will
you learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right
answers anyway
Harry felt restless He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back to take
his mind off his nerves about tomorrow Why should he be afraid of
Snape Getting up he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if
he could have it
Better you than me they said together but Harry had an idea that
Snape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers listening
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked There was no answer
He knocked again Nothing
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there It was worth a try He pushed
the door ajar and peered inside  and a horrible scene met his eyes
Snape and Filch were inside alone Snape was holding his robes above
his knees One of his legs was bloody and mangled Filch was handing
Snape bandages
Blasted thing Snape was saying How are you supposed to keep your
eyes on all three heads at once
Harry tried to shut the door quietly but 
POTTER
Snapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to
hide his leg Harry gulped
I just wondered if I could have my book back
GET OUT OUT
