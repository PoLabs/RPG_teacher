grow Arthropods are eucoelomate protostomic organisms often with incredibly complicated life cycles
Phylum Arthropoda
The name arthropoda means jointed feet The name aptly describes the invertebrates included in this phylum
Arthropods have probably always dominated the animal kingdom in terms of number of species and likely will
continue to do so An estimated 85 percent of all known species are included in this phylum In effect life on
Earth could conceivably be called the Age of Arthropods beginning nearly 500 million years ago
The principal characteristics of all the animals in this phylum are the structural and functional segmentation
of the body and the presence of jointed appendages Arthropods have an exoskeleton made principally of
chitina waterproof tough polysaccharide composed of Nacetylglucosamine Phylum Arthropoda is the most
speciose clade in the animal world Table 281 and insects form the single largest class within this phylum For

Phylum Arthropoda includes animals that have been successful in colonizing terrestrial aquatic and aerial
habitats This phylum is further classified into five subphyla Trilobita trilobites all extinct Chelicerata
horseshoe crabs spiders scorpions ticks mites and daddy longlegs or harvestmen Myriapoda millipedes
centipedes and their relatives Crustacea crabs lobsters crayfish isopods barnacles and some
zooplankton and Hexapoda insects and their sixlegged relatives Trilobites an extinct group of arthropods
found chiefly in the preCambrian Era about 500 million years ago are probably most closely related to the
Chelicerata These are identified based on their fossils they were quite diverse and radiated significantly into
thousands of species before their complete extinction at the end of the Permian about 240 million years ago
