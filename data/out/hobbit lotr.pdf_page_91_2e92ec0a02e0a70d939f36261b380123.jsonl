shelf
No you dont he heard Dori answering because the bacon knows that it
will get back in the pan sooner or later and it is to be hoped we shant Also
eagles arent forks
O no Not a bit like storksforks I mean said Bilbo sitting up and
looking anxiously at the eagle who was perched close by He wondered what
other nonsense he had been saying and if the eagle would think it rude You
ought not to be rude to an eagle when you are only the size of a hobbit and are
up in his eyrie at night
The eagle only sharpened his beak on a stone and trimmed his feathers and
took no notice
Soon another eagle flew up The Lord of the Eagles bids you to bring your
prisoners to the Great Shelf he cried and was off again The other seized Dori
in his claws and flew away with him into the night leaving Bilbo all alone He
had just strength to wonder what the messenger had meant by prisoners and to
begin to think of being torn up for supper like a rabbit when his own turn came
The eagle came back seized him in his talons by the back of his coat and
swooped off This time he flew only a short way Very soon Bilbo was laid
down trembling with fear on a wide shelf of rock on the mountainside There
was no path down on to it save by flying and no path down off it except by
jumping over a precipice There he found all the others sitting with their backs to
the mountain wall The Lord of the Eagles also was there and was speaking to
Gandalf
It seemed that Bilbo was not going to be eaten after all The wizard and the
eaglelord appeared to know one another slightly and even to be on friendly
terms As a matter of fact Gandalf who had often been in the mountains had
once rendered a service to the eagles and healed their lord from an arrowwound
So you see prisoners had meant prisoners rescued from the goblins only and
not captives of the eagles As Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf he realized
that at last they were going to escape really and truly from the dreadful
mountains He was discussing plans with the Great Eagle for carrying the
dwarves and himself and Bilbo far away and setting them down well on their
journey across the plains below
