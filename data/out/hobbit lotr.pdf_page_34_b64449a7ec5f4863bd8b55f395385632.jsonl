were toasting mutton on long spits of wood and licking the gravy off their
fingers There was a fine toothsome smell Also there was a barrel of good drink
at hand and they were drinking out of jugs But they were trolls Obviously
trolls Even Bilbo in spite of his sheltered life could see that from the great
heavy faces of them and their size and the shape of their legs not to mention
their language which was not drawingroom fashion at all at all
Mutton yesterday mutton today and blimey if it dont look like mutton
again tomorrer said one of the trolls
Never a blinking bit of manflesh have we had for long enough said a
second What the ell William was athinkin of to bring us into these parts at
all beats meand the drink runnin short whats more he said jogging the
elbow of William who was taking a pull at his jug
William choked Shut yer mouth he said as soon as he could Yer cant
expect folk to stop here for ever just to be et by you and Bert Youve et a village
and a half between yer since we come down from the mountains How much
more dyer want And times been up our way when yerd have said thank yer
Bill for a nice bit o fat valley mutton like what this is He took a big bite off a
sheeps leg he was roasting and wiped his lips on his sleeve
Yes I am afraid trolls do behave like that even those with only one head
each After hearing all this Bilbo ought to have done something at once Either
he should have gone back quietly and warned his friends that there were three
fairsized trolls at hand in a nasty mood quite likely to try roasted dwarf or even
pony for a change or else he should have done a bit of good quick burgling A
really firstclass and legendary burglar would at this point have picked the trolls
pocketsit is nearly always worth while if you can manage it pinched the
very mutton off the spits purloined the beer and walked off without their
noticing him Others more practical but with less professional pride would
perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them before they observed it Then the
night could have been spent cheerily
Bilbo knew it He had read of a good many things he had never seen or done
He was very much alarmed as well as disgusted he wished himself a hundred
miles away and yetand yet somehow he could not go straight back to Thorin
and Company emptyhanded So he stood and hesitated in the shadows Of the
various burglarious proceedings he had heard of picking the trolls pockets
seemed the least difficult so at last he crept behind a tree just behind William
Bert and Tom went off to the barrel William was having another drink Then
Bilbo plucked up courage and put his little hand in Williams enormous pocket
