filament movement Figure 3836
Figure 3836 When a a sarcomere b contracts the Z lines move closer together and the I band gets smaller The A
band stays the same width and at full contraction the thin filaments overlap
When a sarcomere shortens some regions shorten whereas others stay the same length A sarcomere is
defined as the distance between two consecutive Z discs or Z lines when a muscle contracts the distance
between the Z discs is reduced The H zonethe central region of the A zonecontains only thick filaments
and is shortened during contraction The I band contains only thin filaments and also shortens The A band
does not shortenit remains the same lengthbut A bands of different sarcomeres move closer together during
contraction eventually disappearing Thin filaments are pulled by the thick filaments toward the center of the
sarcomere until the Z discs approach the thick filaments The zone of overlap in which thin filaments and thick
filaments occupy the same area increases as the thin filaments move inward
ATP and Muscle Contraction
The motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to actin and pull the actin inwards This action
requires energy which is provided by ATP Myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the globular actin protein
Myosin has another binding site for ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP releasing an
inorganic phosphate molecule and energy
ATP binding causes myosin to release actin allowing actin and myosin to detach from each other After this
happens the newly bound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate Pi The enzyme at the binding
site on myosin is called ATPase The energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin
head into a cocked position The myosin head is then in a position for further movement possessing potential
energy but ADP and Pi are still attached If actin binding sites are covered and unavailable the myosin will
remain in the high energy configuration with ATP hydrolyzed but still attached
If the actin binding sites are uncovered a crossbridge will form that is the myosin head spans the distance
