Introduction
Living in the twentyfirst century we often think that we inhabit an age 
of unprecedented mobility As a result of the technical innovations of the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuriessuch as railways steam ships the 
automobile air travel and communications technologies like the telephone 
the telegraph and the Internetwe have dramatically increased the speed 
of communication compared with that of the physical conveyance of written 
messages in earlier times Mobility and migration however were already 
omnipresent in the early modern period both within Europe itself and between 
Europe and other parts of the world such as Asia and the Americas In fact 
the frequency of migration may have been even higher than in todays world 
of nationstates and potentially closed national borders even if movement 
itselfon foot on the backs of animals or aboard sailing vesselswas much 
slower Some historians have described a marked increase in geographic 
mobility on a global scale as one of the defining characteristics of a global 
early modernity
One major reason for this high degree of mobility was the fact that 
throughout the early modern period Europe was a patchwork of relatively 
small territories and cities many of which were de facto autonomous This 
situation created not only opportunities and incentives for migrationas 
skilled labourers for example sought employment elsewherenascent 
states had only very limited abilities resources and information to restrict 
movement across the borders of their territories even when they wanted to 
do so Nevertheless early modern governments had a significant impact on 
the movement of people Citiesand capitals in particularattracted people 
who could meet the governments demands for soldiers administrators
