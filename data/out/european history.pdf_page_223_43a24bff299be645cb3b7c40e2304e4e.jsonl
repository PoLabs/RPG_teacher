circulated widely throughout the sixteenth century in Latin English French 
and Italian translations From the seventeenth century onwards we also have 
treatises written by midwives The French royal midwife Louise Bourgeois 
15631636 was the first woman to publish about her art the handbook of 
the court midwife Justine Siegemund 16361705 from Lower Silesia enjoyed 
particular success In her richly illustrated book which she compiled on the 
basis of her readings and her own practical experience she primarily addressed 
other midwives she wanted to teach Siegemund shows how assistance could 
be given during birth Another famous treatise by the Parisian midwife 
Anglique Marguerite Le Boursier du Coudray first published in 1759 even 
had coloured plates in its second edition 1777 The rarity of such colour 
illustrations proves that it was a very popular text for which such expensive 
additions were seen as worthwhile These works reveal how midwives dealt 
with difficult births but also which instruments and manual techniques they 
used how they performed emergency baptisms and more generally the ways 
in which the unborn were imagined
At the end of the eighteenth century responsibilities shifted midwives 
were no longer chosen by childbearing women as before but instead had to 
pass examinations organised by male physicians The first lyingin hospitals 
were established during the eighteenth century If one compares the situation 
in Europe then clear differences become visible For example the university
affiliated lyingin hospital Accouchierhaus established in Gttingen in 1751 
served primarily to train male obstetricians Lyingin hospitals in Catholic 
countries existed in part to offer unmarried women the possibility to preserve 
their honour In Milan since 1780 and Paris Office des Accouches of the 
HtelDieu founded in 1378 but with vastly greater influence in the latter half 
of the eighteenth century they were directly connected to foundling homes 
In England however hospitals such as the Lyingin Hospital for Married 
Women established in London in 1749 accepted only poor married women 
and existed thanks to philanthropic organisations Throughout Europe at 
the beginning of this process of medicalisation the risk of infection childbed 
fever in these clinics was extremely high so that betteroff women preferred 
to give birth at home until the nineteenth century In some regions newborns 
were systematically given to wet nurses In Tuscany sometimes fatherstobe 
were involved in discussions about the choice of wet nurse demonstrating 
that the task of caring for newborns was not an exclusively female one
With the increasing regulation and institutionalisation of marriages in the 
course of the Reformation and Catholic reform pregnancy outside marriage 
became a real problem Until well into the sixteenth century a marriage vow 
and consummation of the marriage had been sufficient to declare a marriage 
legally valid However in subsequent decades ecclesiastical authorities
