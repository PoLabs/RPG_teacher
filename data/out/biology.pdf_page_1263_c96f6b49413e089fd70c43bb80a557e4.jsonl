plan such as jellies Cnidaria and comb jellies Ctenophora also use diffusion through their epidermis and
internally through the gastrovascular compartment Both their internal and external tissues are bathed in an
aqueous environment and exchange fluids by diffusion on both sides as illustrated in Figure 403b Exchange
of fluids is assisted by the pulsing of the jellyfish body
Figure 403 Simple animals consisting of a single cell layer such as the a sponge or only a few cell layers such as
the b jellyfish do not have a circulatory system Instead gases nutrients and wastes are exchanged by diffusion
For more complex organisms diffusion is not efficient for cycling gases nutrients and waste effectively through
the body therefore more complex circulatory systems evolved Most arthropods and many mollusks have
open circulatory systems In an open system an elongated beating heart pushes the hemolymph through the
body and muscle contractions help to move fluids The larger more complex crustaceans including lobsters
have developed arteriallike vessels to push blood through their bodies and the most active mollusks such as
squids have evolved a closed circulatory system and are able to move rapidly to catch prey Closed circulatory
systems are a characteristic of vertebrates however there are significant differences in the structure of the
heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptation during evolution and
associated differences in anatomy Figure 404 illustrates the basic circulatory systems of some vertebrates
