control and exploitation of the environment to a previously unforeseen 
extent The construction of advanced infrastructural works such as roads and 
canals illustrates this Some of these works were great feats of engineering 
such as the Canal du Midi between the Atlantic Ocean near Toulouse and the 
Mediterranean Sea near Vauban completed in 1681 The canal crossed the 
European watershed and helped circumvent the long and arduous journey 
around the Iberian Peninsula This was only possible thanks to technological 
advancement in the use of hydraulics and the construction of a number of 
locks The Canal du Midi was a transformative intervention in the natural 
waterways of the region and allowed for a great simplification of trade routes 
from the seventeenth century onwards 
A century later technological innovations such as the steam engine 
the spinning machine or the mechanical loom helped develop new forms 
of industrial production first in England and then in Belgium and the 
German lands resulting in further alterations of the environment in these 
regions Resource extraction both intensified and changed coal mining in 
particular increased rapidly making use of newly developing techniques 
for underground mining Early forms of industrialisation were inextricably 
linked to the growth of cities long before nineteenthcentury urbanisation 
took shape New urban centres emerged for example in the Ruhr region and 
existing towns across Europe changed fundamentally These processes were 
not only linked to technology but also to everunpredictable natural crises 
Disasters such as the destruction of Lisbon by an earthquake in 1755 triggered 
a profound transformation of both built environments and peoples religious 
beliefs and value systems The earthquake brought with it devastating fires 
and a tsunami destroying the Portuguese capital almost entirely and shocking 
contemporary eyewitnesses Nonetheless despite this devastation the citys 
reconstruction was remarkable in its scale and ambition A truly new city 
was planned and built with wide and straight alleys and large squares More 
importantly earthquakeresistant construction methods were now being 
developed and implemented 
The intensification of land use the transformation of environments and 
more sophisticated extraction of natural resources which characterised the 
early modern era were accompanied by a change in statehood and state 
power As technological expertise grew so did the reach and power of state 
authorities over populations and over the environment Human interventions 
into the environment were frequently initiated or stimulated by states 
that simultaneously increased their own scope of action Early modern 
forestry again provides a good example the introduction of rational forest 
management in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries owed much to 
attempts to supplement state revenues In the words of political scientist and 
anthropologist James C Scott the state made both nature and populations
