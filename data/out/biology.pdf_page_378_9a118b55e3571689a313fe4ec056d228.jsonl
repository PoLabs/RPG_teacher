Geneticists Use Karyograms to Identify Chromosomal Aberrations
Although we refer to Mendel as the father of modern genetics he performed his experiments with none
of the tools that the geneticists of today routinely employ One such powerful cytological technique is
karyotyping a method in which geneticists can identify traits characterized by chromosomal abnormalities
from a single cell To observe an individuals karyotype a geneticist first collects a persons cells like white
blood cells from a blood sample or other tissue In the laboratory he or she stimulates the isolated cells
to begin actively dividing The geneticist then applies the chemical colchicine to cells to arrest condensed
chromosomes in metaphase The geneticist then induces swelling in the cells using a hypotonic solution so
the chromosomes spread apart Finally the geneticist preserves the sample in a fixative and applies it to a
slide
The geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better visualize each chromosome
pairs distinct and reproducible banding patterns Following staining the geneticist views the chromosomes
using brightfield microscopy A common stain choice is the Giemsa stain Giemsa staining results in
approximately 400800 bands of tightly coiled DNA and condensed proteins arranged along all 23
chromosome pairs An experienced geneticist can identify each band In addition to the banding patterns
geneticists further identify chromosomes on the basis of size and centromere location To obtain the classic
depiction of the karyotype in which homologous chromosome pairs align in numerical order from longest
to shortest the geneticist obtains a digital image identifies each chromosome and manually arranges the
chromosomes into this pattern Figure 135
At its most basic the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which an individual has too many
or too few chromosomes per cell Examples of this are Down Syndrome which one identifies by a third
copy of chromosome 21 and Turner Syndrome which has the presence of only one X chromosome
in women instead of the normal two characterizes Geneticists can also identify large DNA deletions or
insertions For instance geneticists can identify Jacobsen Syndromewhich involves distinctive facial
features as well as heart and bleeding defectsby a deletion on chromosome 11 Finally the karyotype can
pinpoint translocations which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome
and reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome Translocations are
implicated in certain cancers including chronic myelogenous leukemia
During Mendels lifetime inheritance was an abstract concept that one could only infer by performing
crosses and observing the traits that offspring expressed By observing a karyogram todays geneticists
can actually visualize an individuals chromosomal composition to confirm or predict genetic abnormalities
in offspring even before birth
Chromosome Number Disorders
Of all of the chromosomal disorders chromosome number abnormalities are the most obviously identifiable
from a karyogram Chromosome number disorders include duplicating or losing entire chromosomes as well
as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes They are caused by nondisjunction which
occurs when homologous chromosome pairs or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis Misaligned
or incomplete synapsis or a spindle apparatus dysfunction that facilitates chromosome migration can cause
nondisjunction The risk of nondisjunction occurring increases with the parents age
Nondisjunction can occur during either meiosis I or II with differing results Figure 136 If homologous
chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis I the result is two gametes that lack that particular chromosome
and two gametes with two chromosome copies If sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis II the result
is one gamete that lacks that chromosome two normal gametes with one chromosome copy and one gamete
with two chromosome copies
