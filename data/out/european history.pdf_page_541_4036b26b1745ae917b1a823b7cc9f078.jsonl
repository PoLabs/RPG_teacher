Eastern Europe Extracurricular activities were intense and expected to focus 
on the ideological and political education of young people The church was 
deprived of its role in education except in Poland Unlike in Western Europe 
university studies in Eastern Europe remained a privilege for the few There 
was a system of twotier entrance exams and only the best were admitted to 
universities though children from socially privileged families who earned 
poor grades were admitted to universities by political patronage The socalled 
Friends Associations between nations for instance the SovietHungarian or 
the SovietGerman Friends Association referring to East Germany were 
supported as an early form of intercultural public diplomacy establishing

also meant that their superior was required to guarantee that the employee 
would return back home Otherwise the superior would get into legal trouble 
Political criticism and opposition to state ideology started to show up in the 
sciences during the 1960s the most important representative of this shift

During the Cold War cooperation between east and west remained limited 
However a rapprochement between actors from the western and eastern parts 
of Europe blocked by the socalled Iron Curtain gradually became possible 
from the end of the 1950s during the Khrushchev period This possibility was
