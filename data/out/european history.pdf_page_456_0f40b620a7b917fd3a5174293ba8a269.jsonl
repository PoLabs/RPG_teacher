shoemaker or baker to spend their apprenticeship years on the move In 
several professions migration was regarded as a prerequisite for a craftsman 
to become a master Many guild regulations contained detailed provisions 
in this regard Ambitious architects and engineers were expected to travel to 
Italian towns early on in their careers to continue their education there The 
result was a translocal transregional and transterritorial transfer of science 
and technology making the early modern period a remarkably dynamic 
epoch By acquiring practical skills and knowledge and transferring it to other 
places craftsmen contributed to the production and transformation of science 
and technology
Many of these craftsmen kept travel diaries in which they took notes about 
the knowledge and skills they acquired Some of them even published their 
diaries This connects to the increasing literacy rate and the importance of 
the printing press in the early modern period On a large scale letterpress 
printing affected the circulation of knowledge and influenced practical skills 
among craftsmen workers and others engaged in handicraft and technical 
professions Cheap editions of books and guidebooks found a wide circulation 
and readership and they were carried around by craftsmen on the move This 
early modern readership was composed of educated readers at the courts 
and universities but it also came from the emerging middle classes and 
occasionally from working people In all these cases however this extending 
readership did not necessarily represent radical new beginnings but rather 
built on developments rooted in the Middle Ages
The printing press also contributed significantly to the development of a 
joint horizon of expectations in terms of science and technological change on 
the part of those literate Europeans who participated in the discussions that 
fostered the development of public opinion These processes had a specifically 
European dimension Exchanges through transnational infrastructures such 
as roads canals and the postal system accelerated the interaction between the 
users of technological advances in different regions of Europe from the urban 
centres of Italy to the rural peripheries of northeastern Europe Travelling 
craftsmen with their spatial and intellectual mobility fostered a transnational 
culture of experts in the early modern period But these developments also had 
exclusionary effects that were previously unknown to the people of Europe 
Above all they resulted in demarcations as can be seen in the emerging law 
on patents for example which was intended to protect inventions from 
unauthorised imitations The first patent letters are documented for medieval 
England 1331 In Italy this development began somewhat later in 1416 
the Republic of Venice granted the first patent for a device that processed 
wool into felt It was in Venice that a distinct patent culture developed in the 
following decades initially in glassmaking which gradually spread across 
Europe through migrating craftsmen among others
