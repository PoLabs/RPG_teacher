cropping out of the ground right in the path of the stream which looped itself
about it was a great rock almost a hill of stone like a last outpost of the distant
mountains or a huge piece cast miles into the plain by some giant among giants
Quickly now to the top of this rock the eagles swooped one by one and set
down their passengers
Farewell they cried wherever you fare till your eyries receive you at the
journeys end That is the polite thing to say among eagles
May the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon
walks answered Gandalf who knew the correct reply
And so they parted And though the Lord of the Eagles became in after days
the King of All Birds and wore a golden crown and his fifteen chieftains golden
collars made of the gold that the dwarves gave them Bilbo never saw them

there to help them out of difficulties I am not going to disappear this very
instant said he I can give you a day or two more Probably I can help you out
of your present plight and I need a little help myself We have no food and no
baggage and no ponies to ride and you dont know where you are Now I can
tell you that You are still some miles north of the path which we should have
been following if we had not left the mountain pass in a hurry Very few people
live in these parts unless they have come here since I was last down this way
which is some years ago But there is somebody that I know of who lives not far
