Most chelicerates ingest food using a preoral cavity formed by the chelicerae and pedipalps Some chelicerates
may secrete digestive enzymes to predigest food before ingesting it Parasitic chelicerates like ticks and
mites have evolved bloodsucking apparatuses Members of this subphylum have an open circulatory system
with a heart that pumps blood into the hemocoel Aquatic species like horseshoe crabs have gills whereas
terrestrial species have either tracheae or book lungs for gaseous exchange Chelicerate hemolymph contains
hemocyanin a coppercontaining oxygen transport protein

The nervous system in chelicerates consists of a brain and two ventral nerve cords Chelicerates are dioecious
meaning that the sexes are separate These animals use external fertilization as well as internal fertilization
strategies for reproduction depending upon the species and its habitat Parental care for the young ranges from
absolutely none to relatively prolonged care
