Introduction
Early modern Europe witnessed immense cultural change and conflict with 
huge ramifications for society and politics In this chapter we are interested 
in two cultural processes in particular and how they resulted in new ways

alternative and experimental modes of living The first such process was an 
intensified interest in the lessons of the past and especially antiquity Between 
the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries increasing numbers of people across 
Europe engaged in a selfconscious Renaissance that involved recovering 
the knowledge and skills enjoyed by the ancient Greeks Romans and Arabs 
and working to reclaim that knowledgeto translate learn and disseminate 
it in order to improve contemporary societies The second process concerned 
religion and faith the doctrines and practices determining a persons 
relationship to Godand by extension their fellow men and womenand the 
institutions by which these beliefs were organised and controlled Over the 
course of the long Reformation from the early sixteenth to early eighteenth 
centuries Christian principles and practices were contested often violently 
by a host of Catholic and Protestant denominations with ordinary men and 
women often empowered by their own interpretations of the word of God as 
a result 
One fascinating and complicated convergence of these cultural developments 
was the publication of Utopia by the English statesman and writer Thomas 
More 14781535 in 1516 and the wider dissemination of utopian ways of 
thinking and living thereafter More originally wrote Utopia in Latin for his 
educated humanist friends that is classically educated men with a direct

kept it that way Instead however it became a publishing phenomenon as
