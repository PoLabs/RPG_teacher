reign to nationstates within their respective blocks to allow internal conflicts 
revolutions rebellions terrorism to foster and thriveincluding the escalation 
of many of these internal conflicts by applying repressive and brute force
At the same time a plethora of nonparliamentary action groups student 
movements and social organisations launched their assault on the institutions 
of representative and parliamentary democracy and on the Western 
USdominated capitalist system as such Concerns and protests were voiced 
by anticapitalist and antiauthoritarian movements in the West protesting 
the war in Vietnam for example antibureaucratic radical socialist or human 
rights movements in the East protesting the suppression of the Prague

like the FBIs COINTELPRO and the CIAs Operation CHAOS at the helm 
staging activities against alleged extremist domestic organisations In West
