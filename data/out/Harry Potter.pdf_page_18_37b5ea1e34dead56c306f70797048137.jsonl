close to Harrys Im warning you now boy  any funny business
anything at all  and youll be in that cupboard from now until
Christmas
Im not going to do anything said Harry honestly
But Uncle Vernon didnt believe him No one ever did
The problem was strange things often happened around Harry and it was
just no good telling the Dursleys he didnt make them happen
Once Aunt Petunia tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking
as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors
and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which
she left to hide that horrible scar Dudley had laughed himself silly
at Harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day
where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses
Next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it
had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week
in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he
couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly
Another time Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting
old sweater of Dudleys brown with orange puff balls  The harder she
tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until
finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit
Harry Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to
his great relief Harry wasnt punished
On the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on
the roof of the school kitchens Dudleys gang had been chasing him as
usual when as much to Harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was
sitting on the chimney The Dursleys had received a very angry letter
from Harrys headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school
buildings But all hed tried to do as he shouted at Uncle Vernon
through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash
cans outside the kitchen doors Harry supposed that the wind must have
caught him in mid jump
But today nothing was going to go wrong It was even worth being with
Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school
his cupboard or Mrs Figgs cabbagesmelling living room
