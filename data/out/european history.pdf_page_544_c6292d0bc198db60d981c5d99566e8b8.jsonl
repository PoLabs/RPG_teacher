been the impact of mechanisms behind European funding schemes such as 
the European Research Framework Programmes which have existed since 
1984 to promote crossborder research and development In order to receive 
funding applications must be written expert opinions must be prepared by 
third parties a ranking of the applications is made and the research must then 
be evaluated for future application processes Thus the logic of competition 
has prevailed in higher education
In addition a debate on student mobility and the standardisation of 
courses and degrees gradually emerged in the latetwentieth century and led 
for instance to the implementation of the ERASMUS programme which has 
cofinanced the mobility of students and young researchers in Europe since 
the 1980s The socalled Bologna Process 1999 onwards through which 
European ministers of education and science have sought to create a single 
European Higher Education Area by ensuring the comparability of higher
education qualifications was another outcome of this debate
Conclusion
Europe in the twentieth century was characterised by a general expansion of 
education and knowledge transfer and as a consequence by the spread of 
educational and academic institutions Broadly speaking elementary education 
became available for almost all Europeans in the first half of the century 
Secondary education became a desirable level of study after the Second World

the 1960s onward Higher education gradually lost its elite character except for 
some outstanding universities Academic knowledge transfer via congresses 
and conferences became ubiquitous while memberships of vocational and 
scientific associations proliferated both in national and international frames 
Though the content of education was often determined and controlled by state 
authorities for most of this period academic freedom and the autonomy of 
universities freedom were not questionedat least in Western democracies 
A different development was evident in the young USSR where members 
of the upper classes could not gain access to higher education or to any 
intellectual jobs This schema spread across socialist countries after the Second 
World War But in parallel to the oppression of the traditional middle and 
upper classes in the socialist bloc a broader range of society was granted 
access to knowledge Financial situations were difficult for most citizens of 
socialist countries apart from the nomenklatura and there was strict ideological 
control by the state over intellectual life But this also resulted in an important 
and remarkable growth of real knowledge When the Iron Curtain became 
more permeable the knowledge from the two parts of Europe met along with
