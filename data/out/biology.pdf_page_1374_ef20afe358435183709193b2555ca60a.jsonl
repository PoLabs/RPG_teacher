How are these established In one of the most seminal experiments ever to be carried out in developmental
biology Spemann and Mangold took dorsal cells from one embryo and transplanted them into the belly region
of another embryo They found that the transplanted embryo now had two notochords one at the dorsal site
from the original cells and another at the transplanted site This suggested that the dorsal cells were genetically
programmed to form the notochord and define the axis Since then researchers have identified many genes that
are responsible for axis formation Mutations in these genes leads to the loss of symmetry required for organism
development
Animal bodies have externally visible symmetry However the internal organs are not symmetric For example
the heart is on the left side and the liver on the right The formation of the central leftright axis is an important
process during development This internal asymmetry is established very early during development and involves
many genes Research is still ongoing to fully understand the developmental implications of these genes
