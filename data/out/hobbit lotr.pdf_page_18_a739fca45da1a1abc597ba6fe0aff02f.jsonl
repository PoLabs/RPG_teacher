would go green and come back to hover over the wizards head He had a cloud
of them about him already and in the dim light it made him look strange and
sorcerous Bilbo stood still and watchedhe loved smokeringsand then he
blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smokerings
he had sent up the wind over The Hill
Now for some music said Thorin Bring out the instruments
Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles Dori Nori
and Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats Bombur produced
a drum from the hall Bifur and Bofur went out too and came back with clarinets
that they had left among the walkingsticks Dwalin and Balin said Excuse me
I left mine in the porch Just bring mine in with you said Thorin They came
back with viols as big as themselves and with Thorins harp wrapped in a green
cloth It was a beautiful golden harp and when Thorin struck it the music began
all at once so sudden and sweet that Bilbo forgot everything else and was swept
away into dark lands under strange moons far over The Water and very far from
his hobbithole under The Hill
The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of
The Hill the firelight flickeredit was Apriland still they played on while
the shadow of Gandalfs beard wagged against the wall
The dark filled all the room and the fire died down and the shadows were
lost and still they played on And suddenly first one and then another began to
sing as they played deepthroated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of
their ancient homes and this is like a fragment of their song if it can be like
their song without their music
Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To seek the pale enchanted gold
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep where dark things sleep
In hollow halls beneath the fells
