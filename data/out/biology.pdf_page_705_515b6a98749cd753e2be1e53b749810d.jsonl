Fermentationof grains to produce beer and of fruits to produce wineis an ancient art that humans in most
cultures have practiced for millennia Wild yeasts are acquired from the environment and used to ferment sugars
into CO2 and ethyl alcohol under anaerobic conditions It is now possible to purchase isolated strains of wild
yeasts from different winemaking regions Louis Pasteur was instrumental in developing a reliable strain of
brewers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the French brewing industry in the late 1850s This was one of
the first examples of biotechnology patenting
Many secondary metabolites of fungi are of great commercial importance Antibiotics are naturally produced
by fungi to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria limiting their competition in the natural environment Important
antibiotics such as penicillin and the cephalosporins are isolated from fungi Valuable drugs isolated from fungi
include the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine which reduces the risk of rejection after organ transplant
the precursors of steroid hormones and ergot alkaloids used to stop bleeding Psilocybin is a compound found in
fungi such as Psilocybe semilanceata and Gymnopilus junonius which have been used for their hallucinogenic
properties by various cultures for thousands of years
As simple eukaryotic organisms fungi are important model research organisms Many advances in modern
genetics were achieved by the use of the red bread mold Neurospora crassa Additionally many important
genes originally discovered in S cerevisiae served as a starting point in discovering analogous human genes
As a eukaryotic organism the yeast cell produces and modifies proteins in a manner similar to human cells
as opposed to the bacterium Escherichia coli which lacks the internal membrane structures and enzymes to
tag proteins for export This makes yeast a much better organism for use in recombinant DNA technology
experiments Like bacteria yeasts grow easily in culture have a short generation time and are amenable to
genetic modification
