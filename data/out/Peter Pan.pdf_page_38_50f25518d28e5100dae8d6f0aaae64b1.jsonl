They opened their mouths but the cheers would not come He
overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings
Great news boys he cried I have brought at last a mother for
you all
Still no sound except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on
his knees
Have you not seen her asked Peter becoming troubled She
flew this way
Ah me one voice said and another said Oh mournful day
Tootles rose Peter he said quietly I will show her to you and
when the others would still have hidden her he said Back twins let
Peter see
So they all stood back and let him see and after he had looked for
a little time he did not know what to do next
She is dead he said uncomfortably Perhaps she is frightened at
being dead
He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of
sight of her and then never going near the spot any more They
would all have been glad to follow if he had done this
But there was the arrow He took it from her heart and faced his
band
Whose arrow he demanded sternly
Mine Peter said Tootles on his knees
Oh dastard hand Peter said and he raised the arrow to use it as
a dagger
Tootles did not flinch He bared his breast Strike Peter he said
firmly strike true
Twice did Peter raise the arrow and twice did his hand fall I
cannot strike he said with awe there is something stays my hand
All looked at him in wonder save Nibs who fortunately looked at
Wendy
It is she he cried the Wendy lady see her arm
Wonderful to relate Wendy had raised her arm Nibs bent over her
and listened reverently I think she said Poor Tootles he
whispered
She lives Peter said briefly
Slightly cried instantly The Wendy lady lives
Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button You remember
she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck
See he said the arrow struck against this It is the kiss I gave
her It has saved her life
I remember kisses Slightly interposed quickly let me see it
Ay thats a kiss
Peter did not hear him He was begging Wendy to get better
quickly so that he could show her the mermaids Of course she could
not answer yet being still in a frightful faint but from overhead
came a wailing note
Listen to Tink said Curly she is crying because the Wendy
lives
