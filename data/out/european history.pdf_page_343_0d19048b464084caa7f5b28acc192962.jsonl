32 EMPIRE AND COLONIALISM
323
Belgian colony of the Congo a huge territory with one of bloodiest and most 
tragic colonial histories fell into chaos and civil war mere weeks after the 
proclamation of independence The decolonisation of Angola Mozambique 
Spanish Sahara Portuguese Guinea and So Tom and Prncipe in the mid
1970s marked the final dissolution of European political rule in Africa Anti
colonial struggle of a similar kind however continued in South Africa and 
Zimbabwe while they were independent since 1961 and 1965 respectively 
they were ruled by the white settler minority which was seen as a continuation 
of the old colonial arrangement 
Postcolonial Legacies
However this by no means meant that European influence in the Global South 
disappeared altogether At the instigation of France in particular the early 
institutions of European integration relied on association with African states 
which perpetuated asymmetrical economic relations from the colonial era 
Only slowly and by no means completely were African societies able to free 
themselves from this subordination Moreover only in a few cases has it been 
possible to establish stable democratic and constitutional orders after decades 
of foreign rule The extent to which this is a consequence of colonialism or 
local conflict structures is disputed in historical and social science research
European societies also changed as a result of decolonisation Great 
Britain and France experienced significant immigration from their former 
colonies in the British case mainly from Asia and the Caribbean and in the 
French case mainly from North Africa The integration of migrants was far 
from a universal success They often found themselves in difficult social and 
economic circumstances While settlers from Algeria who were read as white 
quickly gained a foothold in French society North African Muslims remained 
marginalised In many cases their descendants live in the social hot spots of 
the banlieues and have little chance of upward mobility In Britain the rights of 
nationals of the Empire or Commonwealth have been considerably restricted 
over the decades up to and including the threatened expulsion of members 
of the socalled Windrush generation who themselves or whose parents had 
arrived in the country in 1948 The integration of postcolonial migrants was 
most successful in Portugal where many were able to find jobs within a short 
time
This had to do with the regime change in Portugal in 1974 The Carnation 
Revolution put an end to the rightwing authoritarian regime that had existed 
since 1933 The experience of the wars waged by the regime in Africa which 
were as brutal as they were unsuccessful contributed directly to the growth 
of Portuguese opposition and military resistance to the government In France
