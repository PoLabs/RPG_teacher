Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock The sky was quite clear now and
the sea gleamed in the sunlight The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was
still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm
How did you get here Harry asked looking around for another boat
Flew said Hagrid
Flew
Yeah  but well go back in this Not spposed ter use magic now Ive
got yeh
They settled down in the boat Harry still staring at Hagrid trying to
imagine him flying
Seems a shame ter row though said Hagrid giving Harry another of
his sideways looks If I was ter  er  speed things up a bit would
yeh mind not mentionin it at Hogwarts
Of course not said Harry eager to see more magic Hagrid pulled out
the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and
they sped off toward land
Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts Harry asked
Spells  enchantments said Hagrid unfolding his newspaper as he
spoke They say theres dragons guardin the highsecurity vaults And
then yeh gotta find yer way  Gringotts is hundreds of miles under
London see Deep under the Underground Yehd die of hunger tryin ter
get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat
Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper the
Daily Prophet Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to
be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult hed never
had so many questions in his life
Ministry o Magic messin things up as usual Hagrid muttered turning
the page
Theres a Ministry of Magic Harry asked before he could stop
himself
Course said Hagrid They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister 0
