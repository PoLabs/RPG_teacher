Figure 93 The distance between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cellcalled the synaptic gapis very
small and allows for rapid diffusion of the neurotransmitter Enzymes in the synapatic gap degrade some types of
neurotransmitters to terminate the signal
Endocrine Signaling
Signals from distant cells are called endocrine signals and they originate from endocrine cells In the body
many endocrine cells are located in endocrine glands such as the thyroid gland the hypothalamus and the
pituitary gland These types of signals usually produce a slower response but have a longerlasting effect The
ligands released in endocrine signaling are called hormones signaling molecules that are produced in one part
of the body but affect other body regions some distance away
Hormones travel the large distances between endocrine cells and their target cells via the bloodstream which
is a relatively slow way to move throughout the body Because of their form of transport hormones become
diluted and are present in low concentrations when they act on their target cells This is different from paracrine
signaling in which local concentrations of ligands can be very high
Autocrine Signaling
Autocrine signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released This means
the signaling cell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell the prefix auto means self a reminder
that the signaling cell sends a signal to itself This type of signaling often occurs during the early development
of an organism to ensure that cells develop into the correct tissues and take on the proper function Autocrine
signaling also regulates pain sensation and inflammatory responses Further if a cell is infected with a virus
the cell can signal itself to undergo programmed cell death killing the virus in the process In some cases
neighboring cells of the same type are also influenced by the released ligand In embryological development
this process of stimulating a group of neighboring cells may help to direct the differentiation of identical cells into
the same cell type thus ensuring the proper developmental outcome
Direct Signaling Across Gap Junctions
Gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of
neighboring cells These fluidfilled channels allow small signaling molecules called intracellular mediators to
diffuse between the two cells Small molecules such as calcium ions Ca2 are able to move between cells but
large molecules like proteins and DNA cannot fit through the channels The specificity of the channels ensures
that the cells remain independent but can quickly and easily transmit signals The transfer of signaling molecules
communicates the current state of the cell that is directly next to the target cell this allows a group of cells to
coordinate their response to a signal that only one of them may have received In plants plasmodesmata are
ubiquitous making the entire plant into a giant communication network
