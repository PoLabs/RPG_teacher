Most snakes have a skull that is very flexible involving eight rotational joints They also differ from other
squamates by having mandibles lower jaws without either bony or ligamentous attachment anteriorly Having
this connection via skin and muscle allows for great dynamic expansion of the gape and independent motion
of the two sidesboth advantages in swallowing big prey Most snakes are nonvenomous and simply swallow
their prey alive or subdue it by constriction before swallowing it Venomous snakes use their venom both to kill
or immobilize their prey and to help digest it
Although snakes have no eyelids their eyes are protected with a transparent scale Their retinas have both rods
and cones and like many animals they do not have receptor pigments for red light Some species however
can see in the ultraviolet which allows them to track ultraviolet signals in rodent trails Snakes adjust focus
by moving their heads They have lost both external and middle ears although their inner ears are sensitive
to ground vibrations Snakes have a number of sensory structures that assist in tracking prey In pit vipers
like rattlesnakes a sensory pit between the eye and nostrils is sensitive to infrared heat emissions from
warmblooded prey A row of similar pits is located on the upper lip of boids As noted above snakes also use
Jacobsons organ for detecting olfactory signals
Testudines
The turtles terrapins and tortoises are members of the clade Testudines having a shell Figure 2931 and
are characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell The shell in turtles is not just an epidermal covering but is
incorporated into the skeletal system The dorsal shell is called the carapace and includes the backbone and
ribs the ventral shell is called the plastron Both shells are covered with keratinous plates or scutes and the
two shells are held together by a bridge In some turtles the plastron is hinged to allow the head and legs to be
withdrawn under the shell
The two living groups of turtles Pleurodira and Cryptodira have significant anatomical differences and are most
easily recognized by how they retract their necks The more common Cryptodira retract their neck in a vertical
Scurve they appear to simply pull their head backward when retracting Less common Pleurodira sideneck
retract their neck with a horizontal curve basically folding their neck to the side
The Testudines arose approximately 200 million years ago predating crocodiles lizards and snakes There
are about 325 living species of turtles and tortoises Like other reptiles turtles are ectotherms All turtles are
oviparous laying their eggs on land although many species live in or near water None exhibit parental care
Turtles range in size from the speckled padloper tortoise at 8 centimeters 31 inches to the leatherback sea
turtle at 200 centimeters over 6 feet The term turtle is sometimes used to describe only those species of
Testudines that live in the sea with the terms tortoise and terrapin used to refer to species that live on land
and in fresh water respectively
