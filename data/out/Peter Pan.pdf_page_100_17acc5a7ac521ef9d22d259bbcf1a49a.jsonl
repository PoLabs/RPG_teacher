I forget them after I kill them he replied carelessly
When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be
glad to see her he said Who is Tinker Bell
O Peter she said shocked but even when she explained he
could not remember
There are such a lot of them he said I expect she is no more
I expect he was right for fairies dont live long but they are so
little that a short time seems a good while to them
Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as
yesterday to Peter it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her
But he was exactly as fascinating as ever and they had a lovely
spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops
Next year he did not come for her She waited in a new frock
because the old one simply would not meet but he never came
Perhaps he is ill Michael said
You know he is never ill
Michael came close to her and whispered with a shiver Perhaps
there is no such person Wendy and then Wendy would have cried
if Michael had not been crying
Peter came next spring cleaning and the strange thing was that he
never knew he had missed a year
That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him For a little
longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains and she felt
she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge
But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy and
when they met again Wendy was a married woman and Peter was no
more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her
toys Wendy was grown up You need not be sorry for her She was
one of the kind that likes to grow up In the end she grew up of her
own free will a day quicker than other girls
All the boys were grown up and done for by this time so it is
scarcely worth while saying anything more about them You may see
the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office each
carrying a little bag and an umbrella Michael is an enginedriver
Slightly married a lady of title and so he became a lord You see that
judge in a wig coming out at the iron door That used to be Tootles
The bearded man who doesnt know any story to tell his children
was once John
Wendy was married in white with a pink sash It is strange to think
that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns
Years rolled on again and Wendy had a daughter This ought not
to be written in ink but in a golden splash
She was called Jane and always had an odd inquiring look as if
from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask
questions When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly
about Peter Pan She loved to hear of Peter and Wendy told her all
she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous
flight had taken place It was Janes nursery now for her father had
bought it at the three per cents from Wendys father who was no
longer fond of stairs Mrs Darling was now dead and forgotten
