discarded There are relatively few in the worldwide medical community that question the ethics of this type
of procedure which allows individuals scared to have children because of the alleles they carry to do so
successfully The major limitation to this procedure is its expense Not usually covered by medical insurance
and thus out of reach financially for most couples only a very small percentage of all live births use such
complicated methodologies Yet even in cases like these where the ethical issues may seem to be clear
cut not everyone agrees with the morality of these types of procedures For example to those who take
the position that human life begins at conception the discarding of unused embryos a necessary result of
PGD is unacceptable under any circumstances
A murkier ethical situation is found in the selection of a childs sex which is easily performed by PGD
Currently countries such as Great Britain have banned the selection of a childs sex for reasons other than
preventing sexlinked diseases Other countries allow the procedure for family balancing based on the
desire of some parents to have at least one child of each sex Still others including the United States have
taken a scattershot approach to regulating these practices essentially leaving it to the individual practicing
physician to decide which practices are acceptable and which are not
Even murkier are rare instances of disabled parents such as those with deafness or dwarfism who select
embryos via PGD to ensure that they share their disability These parents usually cite many positive aspects
of their disabilities and associated culture as reasons for their choice which they see as their moral right To
others to purposely cause a disability in a child violates the basic medical principle of Primum non nocere
first do no harm This procedure although not illegal in most countries demonstrates the complexity of
ethical issues associated with choosing genetic traits in offspring
Where could this process lead Will this technology become more affordable and how should it be used
With the ability of technology to progress rapidly and unpredictably a lack of definitive guidelines for the use
of reproductive technologies before they arise might make it difficult for legislators to keep pace once they
are in fact realized assuming the process needs any government regulation at all Other bioethicists argue
that we should only deal with technologies that exist now and not in some uncertain future They argue that
these types of procedures will always be expensive and rare so the fears of eugenics and master races
are unfounded and overstated The debate continues
437  Organogenesis and Vertebrate Formation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the process of organogenesis

Identify the anatomical axes formed in vertebrates
Gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise during further development to the
different organs in the animal body This process is called organogenesis Organogenesis is characterized by
rapid and precise movements of the cells within the embryo
Organogenesis
Organs form from the germ layers through the process of differentiation During differentiation the embryonic
stem cells express specific sets of genes which will determine their ultimate cell type For example some cells in
the ectoderm will express the genes specific to skin cells As a result these cells will differentiate into epidermal
cells The process of differentiation is regulated by cellular signaling cascades
Scientists study organogenesis extensively in the lab in fruit flies Drosophila and the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans Drosophila have segments along their bodies and the patterning associated with the segment
formation has allowed scientists to study which genes play important roles in organogenesis along the length of
the embryo at different time points The nematode Celegans has roughly 1000 somatic cells and scientists have
studied the fate of each of these cells during their development in the nematode life cycle There is little variation
in patterns of cell lineage between individuals unlike in mammals where cell development from the embryo is
dependent on cellular cues
In vertebrates one of the primary steps during organogenesis is the formation of the neural system The
