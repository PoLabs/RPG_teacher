Figure 428 A plasmodesma is a channel between two adjacent plant cells cell walls Plasmodesmata allow materials
to pass from one plant cells cytoplasm to an adjacent cells cytoplasm
Tight Junctions
A tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells Figure 429 Proteins predominantly
two proteins called claudins and occludins tightly hold the cells against each other
Figure 429 Tight junctions form watertight connections between adjacent animal cells Proteins create tight junction
adherence credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal
This tight adherence prevents materials from leaking between the cells tight junctions are typically found in
epithelial tissues that line internal organs and cavities and comprise most of the skin For example the tight
junctions of the epithelial cells lining your urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking out into the extracellular
space
Desmosomes
Also only in animal cells are desmosomes which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells
