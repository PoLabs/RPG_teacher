Uses of the Past to Legitimise Religious Movements 
Foxes Book of Martyrs and English Protestants 
In order to legitimise the Reformation movement in Europe it was argued 
that it was necessary to return to the early days of Christianity The idea 
was that by retracing those steps religious practice could return to Christs 
original intentions beforein the eyes of the Reformersthe Catholic Church 
had corrupted the faith According to this logic Protestantism was the true 
Christian religion John Foxes Actes and Monuments of these Latter and Perillous 
Days Touching Matters of the Church published in 1563 was an example 
of this Protestant interpretation The book was part of an effort by English 
Reformers to collect evidence of an unbroken English tradition of ecclesiastical 
independence from Rome The aim was to justify the English decision to break

15331603 for fear that she would head a Protestant rebellion against her 
and usurp her throne This fear provided a strong foundation for Elizabeths 
Protestant rule proving that she could have been a martyr for the Protestant 
cause as well if fate had not intervened The book was incredibly popular 
and became widely known as Foxes Book of Martyrs As head of the Anglican 
Church Queen Elizabeth I even ordered every parish to buy a copy so that it 
would be available to read as well as use in sermons By making the book so
