do it Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead That was no
ordinary cut Thats what yeh get when a Powerful evil curse touches
yeh  took care of yer mum an dad an yer house even  but it didnt
work on you an thats why yer famous Harry No one ever lived after
he decided ter kill em no one except you an hed killed some o the
best witches an wizards of the age  the McKinnons the Bones the
Prewetts  an you was only a baby an you lived
Something very painful was going on in Harrys mind As Hagrids story
came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more
clearly than he had ever remembered it before  and he remembered
something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel
laugh
Hagrid was watching him sadly
Took yeh from the ruined house myself on Dumbledores orders Brought
yeh ter this lot
Load of old tosh said Uncle Vernon Harry jumped he had almost
forgotten that the Dursleys were there Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to
have got back his courage He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were
clenched
Now you listen here boy he snarled I accept theres something
strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured
 and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no
denying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion 
asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types 
just what I expected always knew theyd come to a sticky end 
But at that moment Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink
umbrella from inside his coat Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a
sword he said Im warning you Dursley Im warning you  one more
word 
In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant
Uncle Vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the
wall and fell silent
Thats better said Hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on
the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor
