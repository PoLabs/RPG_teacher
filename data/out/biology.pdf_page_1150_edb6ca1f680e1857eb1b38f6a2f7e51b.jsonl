CHAPTER SUMMARY
361 Sensory Processes
A sensory activation occurs when a physical or chemical stimulus is processed into a neural signal sensory
transduction by a sensory receptor Perception is an individual interpretation of a sensation and is a brain
function Humans have special senses olfaction gustation equilibrium and hearing plus the general senses
of somatosensation
Sensory receptors are either specialized cells associated with sensory neurons or the specialized ends of
sensory neurons that are a part of the peripheral nervous system and they are used to receive information
about the environment internal or external Each sensory receptor is modified for the type of stimulus it
detects For example neither gustatory receptors nor auditory receptors are sensitive to light Each sensory
receptor is responsive to stimuli within a specific region in space which is known as that receptors receptive
field The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical
signal in the nervous system
All sensory signals except those from the olfactory system enter the central nervous system and are routed to
the thalamus When the sensory signal exits the thalamus it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex
dedicated to processing that particular sense
