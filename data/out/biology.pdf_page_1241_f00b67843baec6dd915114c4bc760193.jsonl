a large body and must be able to take up oxygen in accordance with their body size
Human lung size is determined by genetics sex and height At maximal capacity an average lung can hold
almost six liters of air but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity Air in the lungs is measured in terms
of lung volumes and lung capacities Figure 3912 and Table 391 Volume measures the amount of air for
one function such as inhalation or exhalation Capacity is any two or more volumes for example how much
can be inhaled from the end of a maximal exhalation
Figure 3912 Human lung volumes and capacities are shown The total lung capacity of the adult male is six liters
Tidal volume is the volume of air inhaled in a single normal breath Inspiratory capacity is the amount of air taken in
during a deep breath and residual volume is the amount of air left in the lungs after forceful respiration
