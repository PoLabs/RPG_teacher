insoluble in water All steroids have four linked carbon rings and several of them like cholesterol have a short tail
Figure 321 Many steroids also have the OH functional group which puts them in the alcohol classification
sterols
Figure 321 Four fused hydrocarbon rings comprise steroids such as cholesterol and cortisol
Cholesterol is the most common steroid The liver synthesizes cholesterol and is the precursor to many steroid
