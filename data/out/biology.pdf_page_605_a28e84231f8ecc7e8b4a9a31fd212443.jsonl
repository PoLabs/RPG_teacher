fungi and bacteria
Biofilms are present almost everywhere they can cause the clogging of pipes and readily colonize surfaces in
industrial settings In recent largescale outbreaks of bacterial contamination of food biofilms have played a
major role They also colonize household surfaces such as kitchen counters cutting boards sinks and toilets
as well as places on the human body such as the surfaces of our teeth
Interactions among the organisms that populate a biofilm together with their protective exopolysaccharidic
EPS environment make these communities more robust than freeliving or planktonic prokaryotes The sticky
substance that holds bacteria together also excludes most antibiotics and disinfectants making biofilm bacteria
hardier than their planktonic counterparts Overall biofilms are very difficult to destroy because they are resistant
to many common forms of sterilization
Figure 228 Development of a biofilm Five stages of biofilm development are shown During stage 1 initial
attachment bacteria adhere to a solid surface via weak van der Waals interactions forces produced by induced
electrical interactions between atoms During stage 2 irreversible attachment hairlike appendages called pili
permanently anchor the bacteria to the surface During stage 3 maturation I the biofilm grows through cell
division and recruitment of other bacteria An extracellular matrix composed primarily of polysaccharides holds the
biofilm together During stage 4 maturation II the biofilm continues to grow and takes on a more complex shape
During stage 5 dispersal the biofilm matrix is partly broken down allowing some bacteria to escape and colonize
another surface Micrographs of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in each of the stages of development are
shown credit D Davis Don Monroe PLoS
Compared to freefloating bacteria bacteria in biofilms often show increased resistance to antibiotics and
detergents Why do you think this might be the case
222  Structure of Prokaryotes Bacteria and Archaea
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the basic structure of a typical prokaryote

Describe important differences in structure between Archaea and Bacteria
There are many differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells The name prokaryote suggests that
prokaryotes are defined by exclusionthey are not eukaryotes or organisms whose cells contain a nucleus
and other internal membranebound organelles However all cells have four common structures the plasma
membrane which functions as a barrier for the cell and separates the cell from its environment the cytoplasm
a complex solution of organic molecules and salts inside the cell a doublestranded DNA genome the
informational archive of the cell and ribosomes where protein synthesis takes place Prokaryotes come in
