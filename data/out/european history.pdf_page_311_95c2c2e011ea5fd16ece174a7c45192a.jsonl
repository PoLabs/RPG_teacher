31 STATEBUILDING AND NATIONALISM
291
state socialist regimes in Hungary 1956 and Czechoslovakia 1968 were 
violently suppressed by the Soviet Army but a degree of autonomy in foreign 
policy was allowed in Romania and in Poland for agricultural matters Despite 
attempts at supranational economic and military integration under Soviet 
supremacy in the form of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the 
Warsaw Pact the Soviets were ultimately forced to tolerate the existence of de 
facto nationstates amongst their satellites
Unlike in the east the postwar reconstruction of Europes west south and 
north was characterised by continuity rather than by revolutionary change In 
these states including defeated Germany and Italy liberation from fascism 
restored a model of democracy based on tradition continuity and modernity 
Under the control of the United States this model of liberal democracy and 
market capitalism was consolidated and nationstates reemerged with only 
minor changes despite the establishment of an American informal empire 
by invitation The exceptions to this rule were countries where authoritarian 
regimes had been built and consolidated in the 1930s such as Portugal and 
Spain or where the threat of a communist victory was used to justify the 
restriction of democracy and even the imposition of a dictatorship as had 
happened in Greece As for the rest of Western Europe one of the major changes 
in response to the challenge of postwar reconstruction was the strengthening 
of state power often through the nationalisation of strategic economic sectors 
such as energy transport and public health
Citizenship
With the consolidation of the nationstate and attendant statebuilding 
practices in both Eastern and Western Europe the question of who exactly 
was entitled to citizen status within these political units became prevalent 
Citizenship is a key concept in modern Western political thought and became 
one of its most conspicuous elements in this period The success of the nation
state formula implied that the nation as a community based on certain levels 
of formal equality among its members was now the cornerstone of political 
organisation However the actual meaning of citizenship is plural In the liberal 
tradition citizenship denotes a set of rights and duties that link individuals 
to political power By contrast communitarianism considers citizenship only 
a result of individual identification with the values of a specific community 
Thirdly republicans find the true basis of a working citizenship in civic 
practises that are rooted in common moral ground These three conceptions 
of citizenship are not fully separate they intersect with each other and often 
become entangled in public debates on the nature of the good or full citizen
