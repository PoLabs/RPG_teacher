Harry wasnt sure he could explain Hed just had the best birthday of
his life  and yet  he chewed his hamburger trying to find the
words
Everyone thinks Im special he said at last All those people in the
Leaky Cauldron Professor Quirrell Mr Ollivander but I dont know
anything about magic at all How can they expect great things Im
famous and I cant even remember what Im famous for I dont know what

Hagrid leaned across the table Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he
wore a very kind smile
Don you worry Harry Youll learn fast enough Everyone starts at the
beginning at Hogwarts youll be just fine just be yerself I know its
hard Yehve been singled out an thats always hard But yehll have a
great time at Hogwarts  I did  still do smatter of fact
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the
Dursleys then handed him an envelope
Yer ticket fer Hogwarts  he said First o September  Kings Cross
 its all on yer ticket Any problems with the Dursleys send me a
letter with yer owl shell know where to find me See yeh soon
Harry
The train pulled out of the station Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until
he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against
the window but he blinked and Hagrid had gone
CHAPTER SIX
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREEQUARTERS
Harrys last month with the Dursleys wasnt fun True Dudley was now so
scared of Harry he wouldnt stay in the same room while Aunt Petunia
and Uncle Vernon didnt shut Harry in his cupboard force him to do
anything or shout at him  in fact they didnt speak to him at all
Half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with Harry
in it were empty Although this was an improvement in many ways it did
become a bit depressing after a while
