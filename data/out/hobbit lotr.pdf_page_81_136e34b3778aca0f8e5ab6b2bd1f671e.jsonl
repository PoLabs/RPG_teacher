Then he had questions of his own to ask for if Gandalf had explained it all
by now to the dwarves Bilbo had not heard it He wanted to know how the
wizard had turned up again and where they had all got to now
The wizard to tell the truth never minded explaining his cleverness more
than once so now he told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well aware of
the presence of evil goblins in that part of the mountains But their main gate
used to come out on a different pass one more easy to travel by so that they
often caught people benighted near their gates Evidently people had given up
going that way and the goblins must have opened their new entrance at the top
of the pass the dwarves had taken quite recently because it had been found quite
safe up to now
I must see if I cant find a more or less decent giant to block it up again
said Gandalf or soon there will be no getting over the mountains at all
As soon as Gandalf had heard Bilbos yell he realized what had happened In
the flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside
the crack just as it snapped to He followed after the drivers and prisoners right
to the edge of the great hall and there he sat down and worked up the best magic
he could in the shadows
A very ticklish business it was he said Touch and go
But of course Gandalf had made a special study of bewitchments with fire
and lights even the hobbit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at Old
Tooks midsummereve parties as you remember The rest we all know
except that Gandalf knew all about the backdoor as the goblins called the lower
gate where Bilbo lost his buttons As a matter of fact it was well known to
anybody who was acquainted with this part of the mountains but it took a
wizard to keep his head in the tunnels and guide them in the right direction
They made that gate ages ago he said partly for a way of escape if they
needed one partly as a way out into the lands beyond where they still come in
the dark and do great damage They guard it always and no one has ever
managed to block it up They will guard it doubly after this he laughed
All the others laughed too After all they had lost a good deal but they had
killed the Great Goblin and a great many others besides and they had all
escaped so they might be said to have had the best of it so far
But the wizard called them to their senses We must be getting on at once
now we are a little rested he said They will be out after us in hundreds when
night comes on and already shadows are lengthening They can smell our
footsteps for hours and hours after we have passed We must be miles on before
