have an active site that provides a unique chemical environment comprised of certain amino acid R groups
residues This unique environment is perfectly suited to convert particular chemical reactants for that enzyme
scientists call substrates into unstable intermediates that they call transition states Enzymes and substrates
bind with an induced fit which means that enzymes undergo slight conformational adjustments upon substrate
contact leading to full optimal binding Enzymes bind to substrates and catalyze reactions in four different
ways bringing substrates together in an optimal orientation compromising the bond structures of substrates so
that bonds can break down more easily providing optimal environmental conditions for a reaction to occur or
participating directly in their chemical reaction by forming transient covalent bonds with the substrates
Enzyme action must be regulated so that in a given cell at a given time the desired reactions catalyze and the
undesired reactions are not Enzymes are regulated by cellular conditions such as temperature and pH They
are also regulated through their location within a cell sometimes compartmentalized so that they can only
catalyze reactions under certain circumstances Enzyme inhibition and activation via other molecules are other
important ways that enzymes are regulated Inhibitors can act competitively noncompetitively or allosterically
Noncompetitive inhibitors are usually allosteric Activators can also enhance enzyme function allosterically The
most common method by which cells regulate the enzymes in metabolic pathways is through feedback
inhibition During feedback inhibition metabolic pathway products serve as inhibitors usually allosteric of one
or more of the enzymes usually the first committed enzyme of the pathway involved in the pathway that
produces them
