Figure 3311 Transitional epithelia of the urinary bladder undergo changes in thickness depending on how full the
bladder is
Which of the following statements about types of epithelial cells is false
a
Simple columnar epithelial cells line the tissue of the lung
b
Simple cuboidal epithelial cells are involved in the filtering of blood in the kidney
c
Pseudostratisfied columnar epithilia occur in a single layer but the arrangement of nuclei makes it
appear that more than one layer is present
d
Transitional epithelia change in thickness depending on how full the bladder is
Connective Tissues
Connective tissues are made up of a matrix consisting of living cells and a nonliving substance called the
ground substance The ground substance is made of an organic substance usually a protein and an inorganic
substance usually a mineral or water The principal cell of connective tissues is the fibroblast This cell makes
the fibers found in nearly all of the connective tissues Fibroblasts are motile able to carry out mitosis and can
synthesize whichever connective tissue is needed Macrophages lymphocytes and occasionally leukocytes
can be found in some of the tissues Some tissues have specialized cells that are not found in the others The
matrix in connective tissues gives the tissue its density When a connective tissue has a high concentration of
cells or fibers it has proportionally a less dense matrix
The organic portion or protein fibers found in connective tissues are either collagen elastic or reticular fibers
Collagen fibers provide strength to the tissue preventing it from being torn or separated from the surrounding
tissues Elastic fibers are made of the protein elastin this fiber can stretch to one and one half of its length and
return to its original size and shape Elastic fibers provide flexibility to the tissues Reticular fibers are the third
type of protein fiber found in connective tissues This fiber consists of thin strands of collagen that form a network
of fibers to support the tissue and other organs to which it is connected The various types of connective tissues
the types of cells and fibers they are made of and sample locations of the tissues is summarized in Table 333
