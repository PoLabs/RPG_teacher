Biotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture
It is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes Knowledge of the genetic makeup of
our species the genetic basis of heritable diseases and the invention of technology to manipulate and fix mutant
genes provides methods to treat the disease Biotechnology in agriculture can enhance resistance to disease
pest and environmental stress and improve both crop yield and quality
Genetic Diagnosis and Gene Therapy
Scientists call the process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment genetic
diagnosis by genetic testing Depending on the inheritance patterns of a diseasecausing gene family
members are advised to undergo genetic testing For example doctors usually advise women diagnosed with
breast cancer to have a biopsy so that the medical team can determine the genetic basis of cancer development
Doctors base treatment plans on genetic test findings that determine the type of cancer If inherited gene
mutations cause the cancer doctors also advise other female relatives to undergo genetic testing and periodic
screening for breast cancer Doctors also offer genetic testing for fetuses or embryos with in vitro fertilization to
determine the presence or absence of diseasecausing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases
Gene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease In its simplest form it involves the
introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a
mutated gene The good gene is usually introduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus
that can infect the host cell and deliver the foreign DNA Figure 179 More advanced forms of gene therapy try
to correct the mutation at the original site in the genome such as is the case with treatment of severe combined
immunodeficiency SCID
Figure 179 Gene therapy using an adenovirus vector can be used to cure certain genetic diseases in which a person
has a defective gene credit NIH
Production of Vaccines Antibiotics and Hormones
Traditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms to mount the initial immune
response Modern techniques use the genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors to mass produce the desired
antigen Doctors then introduce the antigen into the body to stimulate the primary immune response and trigger
immune memory The medical field has used genes cloned from the influenza virus to combat the constantly
changing strains of this virus
Antibiotics are a biotechnological product Microorganisms such as fungi naturally produce them to attain an
