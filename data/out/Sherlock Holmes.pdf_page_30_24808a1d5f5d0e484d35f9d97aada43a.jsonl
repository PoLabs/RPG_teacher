The RedHeaded League
opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which
was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
You are not very vulnerable from above Holmes
remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about
him
Nor from below said Mr Merryweather strik
ing his stick upon the ags which lined the oor
Why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked
looking up in surprise
I must really ask you to be a little more quiet
said Holmes severely You have already imperilled
the whole success of our expedition Might I beg that
you would have the goodness to sit down upon one
of those boxes and not to interfere
The solemn Mr Merryweather perched himself
upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his
face while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the oor
and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to
examine minutely the cracks between the stones A
few seconds sufced to satisfy him for he sprang to
his feet again and put his glass in his pocket
We have at least an hour before us he remarked
for they can hardly take any steps until the good
pawnbroker is safely in bed Then they will not lose a
minute for the sooner they do their work the longer
time they will have for their escape We are at present
Doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar
of the City branch of one of the principal London
banks Mr Merryweather is the chairman of directors
and he will explain to you that there are reasons why
the more daring criminals of London should take a
considerable interest in this cellar at present
It is our French gold whispered the director
We have had several warnings that an attempt might
be made upon it
Your French gold
Yes
We had occasion some months ago to
strengthen our resources and borrowed for that pur
pose 30000 napoleons from the Bank of France It has
become known that we have never had occasion to un
pack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar
The crate upon which I sit contains 2000 napoleons
packed between layers of lead foil Our reserve of
bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept
in a single branch ofce and the directors have had
misgivings upon the subject
Which were very well justied observed
Holmes And now it is time that we arranged our
little plans I expect that within an hour matters will
come to a head In the meantime Mr Merryweather
we must put the screen over that dark lantern
And sit in the dark
I am afraid so I had brought a pack of cards in
my pocket and I thought that as we were a partie
carree you might have your rubber after all But I see
that the enemys preparations have gone so far that
we cannot risk the presence of a light And rst of
all we must choose our positions These are daring
men and though we shall take them at a disadvan
tage they may do us some harm unless we are careful
I shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal
yourselves behind those Then when I ash a light
upon them close in swiftly If they re Watson have
no compunction about shooting them down
I placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the
wooden case behind which I crouched Holmes shot
the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in
pitch darknesssuch an absolute darkness as I have
never before experienced The smell of hot metal re
mained to assure us that the light was still there ready
to ash out at a moments notice To me with my
nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was
something depressing and subduing in the sudden
gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault
They have but one retreat whispered Holmes
That is back through the house into SaxeCoburg
Square I hope that you have done what I asked you
Jones
I have an inspector and two ofcers waiting at
the front door
Then we have stopped all the holes And now we
must be silent and wait
What a time it seemed From comparing notes
afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it
appeared to me that the night must have almost gone
and the dawn be breaking above us My limbs were
weary and stiff for I feared to change my position
yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch
of tension and my hearing was so acute that I could
not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
but I could distinguish the deeper heavier inbreath
of the bulky Jones from the thin sighing note of the
bank director From my position I could look over the
case in the direction of the oor Suddenly my eyes
caught the glint of a light
At rst it was but a lurid spark upon the stone
pavement Then it lengthened out until it became a
yellow line and then without any warning or sound
a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white
almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre
of the little area of light For a minute or more the
hand with its writhing ngers protruded out of the
