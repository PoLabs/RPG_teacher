Different countries have different preferred platforms For instance Weibo and WeChat are 
dominant in China and Vkontakte is popular in Russia 
Make sure you do your research so that you know which platforms your audience is active on 
and where you might want to advertise Reddit for example redditcom along with similar 
content curation platforms is great for sharing good content but the community is very 
advertisingsavvy and does not welcome overt ads that do not provide value to the user

176 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES
Some of the difficulties of advertising on social media are the same as the difficulties of being 
on social media in general They include
	
Promoted posts all need to work hard to make an authentic connection with the audience
	
You need to consistently promote good content
	
There is always the chance that your audience will respond negatively to a post which 
can escalate quickly 
	
Choosing the right platform to advertise on can be a challenge
	
Tying ad spend on social media to revenue increases can be difficult since the benefits of 
advertising on these platforms are often indirect Take a look at Sprout Socials How to define 
an actionable social media ROI for your business for some tips sproutsocialcominsights
socialmediaroiguide It is important to clarify with whomever you are reporting to that ROI 
on social media is not an exact science Far more data is available than on traditional media 
but it has its limits So rather than drawing a clear line from social media advertising to sales 
look at encouraging behaviours that lead to sales such as convincing users to sign up for a test 
drive rather than attempting to sell a car You can easily calculate your ROI if you know how 
many signups for test drives you get from Facebook and how many test drives result in sales
Despite its challenges advertising on social media cannot be avoided If you want to reach 
the maximum possible number of users with granular targeting that ensures youre reaching 
exactly the right users at the right time social media advertising is the way to go It is also the 
only way to ensure that a significant portion of your audience per platform will see your posts
