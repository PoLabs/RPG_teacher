72  Glycolysis
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the overall result in terms of molecules produced during the chemical breakdown of glucose by
glycolysis

Compare the output of glycolysis in terms of ATP molecules and NADH molecules produced
As you have read nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar glucose
Glycolysis is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism In fact nearly
all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism The process does not use oxygen directly
and therefore is termed anaerobic Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
cells Glucose enters heterotrophic cells in two ways One method is through secondary active transport in which
the transport takes place against the glucose concentration gradient The other mechanism uses a group of
integral proteins called GLUT proteins also known as glucose transporter proteins These transporters assist
in the facilitated diffusion of glucose
Glycolysis begins with the sixcarbon ringshaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two
molecules of a threecarbon sugar called pyruvate Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases The first part of
the glycolysis pathway traps the glucose molecule in the cell and uses energy to modify it so that the sixcarbon
sugar molecule can be split evenly into the two threecarbon molecules The second part of glycolysis extracts
energy from the molecules and stores it in the form of ATP and NADHremember this is the reduced form of
NAD
First Half of Glycolysis EnergyRequiring Steps
Step 1 The first step in glycolysis Figure 76 is catalyzed by hexokinase an enzyme with broad specificity
that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sixcarbon sugars Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose using ATP as
the source of the phosphate producing glucose6phosphate a more reactive form of glucose This reaction
prevents the phosphorylated glucose molecule from continuing to interact with the GLUT proteins and it can no
longer leave the cell because the negatively charged phosphate will not allow it to cross the hydrophobic interior
of the plasma membrane
Step 2 In the second step of glycolysis an isomerase converts glucose6phosphate into one of its isomers
fructose6phosphate this isomer has a phosphate attached at the location of the sixth carbon of the ring An
isomerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers This change from
phosphoglucose to phosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two threecarbon molecules
Step

The
third
step
is
the
phosphorylation
of
fructose6phosphate
catalyzed
by
the
enzyme
phosphofructokinase A second ATP molecule donates a highenergy phosphate to fructose6phosphate
producing fructose16bisphosphate In this pathway phosphofructokinase is a ratelimiting enzyme It is active
when the concentration of ADP is high it is less active when ADP levels are low and the concentration of ATP
is high Thus if there is sufficient ATP in the system the pathway slows down This is a type of end product
inhibition since ATP is the end product of glucose catabolism
Step 4 The newly added highenergy phosphates further destabilize fructose16bisphosphate The fourth step
in glycolysis employs an enzyme aldolase to cleave fructose16bisphosphate into two threecarbon isomers
dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde3phosphate
Step 5 In the fifth step an isomerase transforms the dihydroxyacetonephosphate into its isomer
glyceraldehyde3phosphate
Thus
the
pathway
will
continue
with
two
molecules
of
a
glyceraldehyde3phosphate At this point in the pathway there is a net investment of energy from two ATP
molecules in the breakdown of one glucose molecule
