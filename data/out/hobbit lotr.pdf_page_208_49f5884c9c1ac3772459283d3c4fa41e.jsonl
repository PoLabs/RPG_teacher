The dwarves of yore made mighty spells
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep where dark things sleep
In hollow halls beneath the fells
On silver necklaces they strung
The light of stars on crowns they hung
The dragonfire from twisted wire
The melody of harps they wrung
The mountain throne once more is freed
O wandering folk the summons heed
Come haste Come haste across the waste
The king of friend and kin has need
Now call we over mountains cold
Come back unto the caverns old
Here at the Gates the king awaits
His hands are rich with gems and gold
The king is come unto his hall
Under the Mountain dark and tall
The Worm of Dread is slain and dead
And ever so our foes shall fall
This song appeared to please Thorin and he smiled again and grew merry
and he began reckoning the distance to the Iron Hills and how long it would be
before Dain could reach the Lonely Mountain if he had set out as soon as the
message reached him But Bilbos heart fell both at the song and the talk they
sounded much too warlike
The next morning early a company of spearmen was seen crossing the river
and marching up the valley They bore with them the green banner of the
Elvenking and the blue banner of the Lake and they advanced until they stood
right before the wall at the Gate
