Carrier Proteins
Another type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein This aptly named protein
binds a substance and thus triggers a change of its own shape moving the bound molecule from the cells
outside to its interior Figure 510 Depending on the gradient the material may move in the opposite direction
Carrier proteins are typically specific for a single substance This selectivity adds to the plasma membranes
overall selectivity Scientists poorly understand the exact mechanism for the change of shape Proteins can
change shape when their hydrogen bonds are affected but this may not fully explain this mechanism Each
carrier protein is specific to one substance and there are a finite number of these proteins in any membrane
This can cause problems in transporting enough material for the cell to function properly When all of the
proteins are bound to their ligands they are saturated and the rate of transport is at its maximum Increasing the
concentration gradient at this point will not result in an increased transport rate
Figure 510 Some substances are able to move down their concentration gradient across the plasma membrane with
the aid of carrier proteins Carrier proteins change shape as they move molecules across the membrane credit

An example of this process occurs in the kidney In one part the kidney filters glucose water salts ions and
amino acids that the body requires This filtrate which includes glucose then reabsorbs in another part of the
kidney Because there are only a finite number of carrier proteins for glucose if more glucose is present than
the proteins can handle the excess is not transported and the body excretes this through urine In a diabetic
individual the term is spilling glucose into the urine A different group of carrier proteins glucose transport
proteins or GLUTs are involved in transporting glucose and other hexose sugars through plasma membranes
within the body
Channel and carrier proteins transport material at different rates Channel proteins transport much more quickly
than carrier proteins Channel proteins facilitate diffusion at a rate of tens of millions of molecules per second
whereas carrier proteins work at a rate of a thousand to a million molecules per second
Osmosis
Osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the waters concentration
gradient across the membrane which is inversely proportional to the solutes concentration While diffusion
transports material across membranes and within cells osmosis transports only water across a membrane and
the membrane limits the solutes diffusion in the water Not surprisingly the aquaporins that facilitate water
movement play a large role in osmosis most prominently in red blood cells and the membranes of kidney
tubules
Mechanism
Osmosis is a special case of diffusion Water like other substances moves from an area of high concentration
to one of low concentration An obvious question is what makes water move at all Imagine a beaker with a
semipermeable membrane separating the two sides or halves Figure 511 On both sides of the membrane
the water level is the same but there are different dissolved substance concentrations or solute that cannot
