Dear ones she said if you will all come with me I feel almost
sure I can get my father and mother to adopt you
The invitation was meant specially for Peter but each of the boys
was thinking exclusively of himself and at once they jumped with
joy
But wont they think us rather a handful Nibs asked in the
middle of his jump
Oh no said Wendy rapidly thinking it out it will only mean
having a few beds in the drawingroom they can be hidden behind
the screens on first Thursdays
Peter can we go they all cried imploringly They took it for
granted that if they went he would go also but really they scarcely
cared Thus children are ever ready when novelty knocks to desert
their dearest ones
All right Peter replied with a bitter smile and immediately they
rushed to get their things
And now Peter Wendy said thinking she had put everything
right I am going to give you your medicine before you go She
loved to give them medicine and undoubtedly gave them too much
Of course it was only water but it was out of a bottle and she always
shook the bottle and counted the drops which gave it a certain
medicinal quality On this occasion however she did not give Peter
his draught for just as she had prepared it she saw a look on his face
that made her heart sink
Get your things Peter she cried shaking
No he answered pretending indifference I am not going with
you Wendy
Yes Peter
No
To show that her departure would leave him unmoved he skipped
up and down the room playing gaily on his heartless pipes She had
to run about after him though it was rather undignified
To find your mother she coaxed
Now if Peter had ever quite had a mother he no longer missed
her He could do very well without one He had thought them out
and remembered only their bad points
No no he told Wendy decisively perhaps she would say I was
old and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun
But Peter
No
And so the others had to be told
Peter isnt coming
Peter not coming They gazed blankly at him their sticks over
their backs and on each stick a bundle Their first thought was that if
Peter was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting
them go
But he was far too proud for that If you find your mothers he
said darkly I hope you will like them
