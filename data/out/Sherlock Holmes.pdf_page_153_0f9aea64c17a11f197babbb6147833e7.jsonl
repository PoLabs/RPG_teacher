The Adventure of the Copper Beeches
think t you very well Then as to sitting
here or there or amusing yourself in any
manner indicated that need cause you no
inconvenience As regards your hair it
is no doubt a pity especially as I could
not help remarking its beauty during our
short interview but I am afraid that I must
remain rm upon this point and I only
hope that the increased salary may recom
pense you for the loss Your duties as far
as the child is concerned are very light
Now do try to come and I shall meet you
with the dogcart at Winchester Let me
know your train
  Yours faithfully
 Jephro Rucastle
That is the letter which I have just received Mr
Holmes and my mind is made up that I will accept
it I thought however that before taking the nal
step I should like to submit the whole matter to your
consideration
Well Miss Hunter if your mind is made up that
settles the question said Holmes smiling
But you would not advise me to refuse
I confess that it is not the situation which I should
like to see a sister of mine apply for
What is the meaning of it all Mr Holmes
Ah I have no data I cannot tell Perhaps you
have yourself formed some opinion
Well there seems to me to be only one possi
ble solution Mr Rucastle seemed to be a very kind
goodnatured man Is it not possible that his wife is
a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for
fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he
humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent
an outbreak
That is a possible solutionin fact as matters
stand it is the most probable one But in any case
it does not seem to be a nice household for a young
lady
But the money Mr Holmes the money
Well yes of course the pay is goodtoo good
That is what makes me uneasy Why should they give
you 120 a year when they could have their pick for
40 There must be some strong reason behind
I thought that if I told you the circumstances you
would understand afterwards if I wanted your help I
should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at
the back of me
Oh you may carry that feeling away with you I
assure you that your little problem promises to be the
most interesting which has come my way for some
months There is something distinctly novel about
some of the features If you should nd yourself in
doubt or in danger
Danger What danger do you foresee
Holmes shook his head gravely It would cease
to be a danger if we could dene it said he But at
any time day or night a telegram would bring me
down to your help
That is enough She rose briskly from her chair
with the anxiety all swept from her face I shall go
down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now I
shall write to Mr Rucastle at once sacrice my poor
hair tonight and start for Winchester tomorrow
With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us
both goodnight and bustled off upon her way
At least said I as we heard her quick rm steps
descending the stairs she seems to be a young lady
who is very well able to take care of herself
And she would need to be said Holmes gravely
I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her
before many days are past
It was not very long before my friends prediction
was fullled A fortnight went by during which I
frequently found my thoughts turning in her direc
tion and wondering what strange sidealley of hu
man experience this lonely woman had strayed into
The unusual salary the curious conditions the light
duties all pointed to something abnormal though
whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a
philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond my
powers to determine As to Holmes I observed that
he sat frequently for half an hour on end with knitted
brows and an abstracted air but he swept the matter
away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it
Data data data he cried impatiently I cant make
bricks without clay And yet he would always wind
up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have
accepted such a situation
The telegram which we eventually received came
late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and
Holmes was settling down to one of those allnight
chemical researches which he frequently indulged in
when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a
testtube at night and nd him in the same position
when I came down to breakfast in the morning He
opened the yellow envelope and then glancing at the
message threw it across to me
