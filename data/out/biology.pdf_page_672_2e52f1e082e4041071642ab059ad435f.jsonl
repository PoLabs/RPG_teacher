Phytophthora infestans is an oomycete responsible for potato late blight which causes potato stalks and stems
to decay into black slime Figure 2337 Widespread potato blight caused by P infestans precipitated the well
known Irish potato famine in the nineteenth century that claimed the lives of approximately 1 million people and
led to the emigration of at least 1 million more from Ireland Late blight continues to plague potato crops in
certain parts of the United States and Russia wiping out as much as 70 percent of crops when no pesticides are
applied

Protist Decomposers
The funguslike protist saprobes are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter such as dead
organisms or their wastes For instance many types of oomycetes grow on dead animals or algae Saprobic
protists have the essential function of returning inorganic nutrients to the soil and water This process allows for
new plant growth which in turn generates sustenance for other organisms along the food chain Indeed without
saprobe species such as protists fungi and bacteria life would cease to exist as all organic carbon became
tied up in dead organisms
