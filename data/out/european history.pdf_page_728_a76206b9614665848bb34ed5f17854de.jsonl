Religions and National Identities
Europe in the nineteenth century was a continent in constant turmoil far from 
uniform with regards to concepts developments treatments or even the given 
range of existing religions and denominations In France and in many of the 
territories conquered by Napoleon traditional religions and their institutions 
underwent the process of weakening described above yet the situation in the 
continents eastern and southeastern stretches was significantly different as 
the case of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans shows
In contemporary terminology the Ottoman Empire was a multiethnic 
multireligious prenational and feudal empire It was dominated by a Muslim 
Emperor the Sultan or padiah who simultaneously claimed the status of the 
Caliph the spiritual leader of the global Muslim community ummah Given 
that the sultans palace was on the European shore of the Bosporus Europe 
was the seat of the most influential spiritualpolitical Islamic commonwealth 
of the time 
Although Muslims enjoyed significant privileges when compared to the 
other groups the European lands of the Ottoman Empire Rumelia were 
characterised and inhabited by a multitude of religious communities Most 
numerous were the Orthodox Christians Rum spread across Rumelia and 
originally bound to the religious authority of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of 
Constantinople The second largest group were Sunni Muslims often settling 
with a high concentration in the urban centres of BosniaHerzegovina Bulgaria 
Thrace and among Albanian speakers The Sephardic Jews were another 
important group originally from Andalusia with centres in Thessaloniki 
Istanbul Skopje and Sarajevo among other cities There were also Catholic 
Christians Armenians and heterodox or syncretic groups like the Bektashi
