LooseAreolar Connective Tissue
Loose connective tissue also called areolar connective tissue has a sampling of all of the components of a
connective tissue As illustrated in Figure 3312 loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts macrophages
are present as well Collagen fibers are relatively wide and stain a light pink while elastic fibers are thin and stain
dark blue to black The space between the formed elements of the tissue is filled with the matrix The material
in the connective tissue gives it a loose consistency similar to a cotton ball that has been pulled apart Loose
connective tissue is found around every blood vessel and helps to keep the vessel in place The tissue is also
found around and between most body organs In summary areolar tissue is tough yet flexible and comprises
membranes
Figure 3312 Loose connective tissue is composed of loosely woven collagen and elastic fibers The fibers and other
components of the connective tissue matrix are secreted by fibroblasts
Fibrous Connective Tissue
Fibrous connective tissues contain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material The
fibers can be arranged irregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel Irregularly arranged fibrous
connective tissues are found in areas of the body where stress occurs from all directions such as the dermis of
