of continuity rootedness and cultural distinction the attention of cultural 
elites turned to the medieval past and to vernacular traditions finding new 
interest in remnants of Gothic architecture Celtic monuments Nordic Sagas 
and ancient eposes and legends some of which were fabricated rather than 
discovered These relics were used to construct a sense of connection linking 
the nationalist movements of the present back to the mythic past They supplied 
public historical culture with myths heroes and symbolic places as well as 
themes for artistic development For example the adoption of the medieval 
Gothic style as a national style by French English and German intellectuals 
shaped the development of architecture in those countries Others like Czechs 
or Poles looked back to the Renaissance for inspiration viewing the period 
as one of national flourishing Historians crafted influential narratives of the 
national past constructing sometimes precarious continuities and depicting 
major national dramas constituting golden or dark ages in national history 
Often a particular version of the past prevailed and would influence historical 
culture for several decades In the Czech case Frantiek Palacks Djiny nrodu 
eskho v echch a v Morav History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia 
18481872 prevailed though German historians did develop alternative 
interpretations of Bohemian history Sometimes different schools competed 
for an appropriate narrative Polish historiography provides one example 
Some accounts of Polish history idealised the early modern democracy of 
the nobles and blamed neighbouring predatory states for the ultimate failure 
of the Polish state other accounts emphasised the internal deficiencies of the 
illfated political system of the Rzeczpospolita Other examples of contestation 
included disputes over the meaning of the Norman invasion in British history 
or historiographical disputes about the French Revolution
Nationalism within existing states and the aspirations of stateless nations 
found expression in the birth of national museums which stored and studied 
pieces of national heritage while also creating powerful representations of 
national history and the homeland Many of these museums developed from 
regionally or imperially focused institutions The Czech National Museum 
in Prague for instance was founded in 1818 as a patriotic museum for the 
Kingdom of Bohemia and only gradually became the principal museum of 
the Czech nation Later ethnographic museums joined in representing folk 
national heritage for which the openair Skanzen Museum in Stockholm was 
a prototype Expositions of rural and regionally specific cultures ultimately 
subordinated to nations had their parallel in colonial museums in the overseas 
empires To be sure other rationales alongside national ones stood behind 
the proliferation of museums Museums of decorative arts appeared in many 
cities with the intention of cultivating industrial production interweaving 
the tradition of arts and crafts with ambitions of industrial modernity City
