Introduction
Why study ecology Perhaps you are interested in learning about the natural world and how living things
have adapted to the physical conditions of their environment Or perhaps youre a future physician seeking to
understand the connection between your patients health and their environment
Humans are a part of the ecological landscape and human health is one important part of human interaction
with our physical and living environment Lyme disease for instance serves as one modernday example of the
connection between our health and the natural world Figure 441 More formally known as Lyme borreliosis
Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can be transmitted to humans when they are bitten by the deer tick
Ixodes scapularis in the eastern US and Ixodes pacificus along the Pacific coast Deer ticks are the primary
vectors a vector is an organism that transmits a pathogen for this disease However not all ticks carry the
pathogen and not all deer ticks carry the bacteria that will cause Lyme disease in humans Also the ticks I
scapularis and pacificus can have other hosts besides deer In fact it turns out that the probability of infection
depends on the type of host upon which the tick develops a higher proportion of ticks that live on whitefooted
mice carry the bacterium than do ticks that live on deer Knowledge about the environments and population
densities in which the host species is abundant would help a physician or an epidemiologist better understand
how Lyme disease is transmitted and how its incidence could be reduced
