chemical ligand that carries a signal from one nerve cell to the next
signal between nearby cells that is delivered by ligands traveling in the liquid medium in the
space between the cells
enzyme that removes the phosphate group from a molecule that has been previously
phosphorylated
enzyme that degrades cAMP producing AMP to terminate signaling
method of cellular communication used by bacteria that informs them of the abundance of
similar or different bacteria in the environment
protein in or on a target cell that bind to ligands
small nonprotein molecule that propagates a signal within the cell after activation of a
receptor causes its release
interaction of signals from two or more different cellsurface receptors that merge to activate
the same response in the cell
propagation of the signal through the cytoplasm and sometimes also the nucleus of the
cell
cell that releases signal molecules that allow communication with another cell
also signaling cascade chain of events that occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell to
propagate the signal from the plasma membrane to produce a response
chemical signal neurotransmitter that travels between nerve cells
cell that has a receptor for a signal or ligand from a signaling cell
CHAPTER SUMMARY
91 Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors
Cells communicate by both inter and intracellular signaling Signaling cells secrete ligands that bind to target
cells and initiate a chain of events within the target cell The four categories of signaling in multicellular
organisms are paracrine signaling endocrine signaling autocrine signaling and direct signaling across gap
junctions Paracrine signaling takes place over short distances Endocrine signals are carried long distances
through the bloodstream by hormones and autocrine signals are received by the same cell that sent the signal
or other nearby cells of the same kind Gap junctions allow small molecules including signaling molecules to
flow between neighboring cells
Internal receptors are found in the cell cytoplasm Here they bind ligand molecules that cross the plasma
membrane these receptorligand complexes move to the nucleus and interact directly with cellular DNA Cell
surface receptors transmit a signal from outside the cell to the cytoplasm Ion channellinked receptors when
bound to their ligands form a pore through the plasma membrane through which certain ions can pass G
proteinlinked receptors interact with a Gprotein on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane promoting
the exchange of bound GDP for GTP and interacting with other enzymes or ion channels to transmit a signal
Enzymelinked receptors transmit a signal from outside the cell to an intracellular domain of a membrane
bound enzyme Ligand binding causes activation of the enzyme Small hydrophobic ligands like steroids are
able to penetrate the plasma membrane and bind to internal receptors Watersoluble hydrophilic ligands are
unable to pass through the membrane instead they bind to cellsurface receptors which transmit the signal to
the inside of the cell
