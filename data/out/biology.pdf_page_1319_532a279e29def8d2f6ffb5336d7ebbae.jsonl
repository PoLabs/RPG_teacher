422  Adaptive Immune Response
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain adaptive immunity

Compare and contrast adaptive and innate immunity

Describe cellmediated immune response and humoral immune response

Describe immune tolerance
The adaptive or acquired immune response takes days or even weeks to become establishedmuch longer
than the innate response however adaptive immunity is more specific to pathogens and has memory Adaptive
immunity is an immunity that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination This
part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection
In fact without information from the innate immune system the adaptive response could not be mobilized There
are two types of adaptive responses the cellmediated immune response which is carried out by T cells and
the humoral immune response which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies Activated T cells and
B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the invading pathogen
Their attack can kill pathogens directly or secrete antibodies that enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens and
disrupt the infection Adaptive immunity also involves a memory to provide the host with longterm protection
from reinfection with the same type of pathogen on reexposure this memory will facilitate an efficient and quick
response
Antigenpresenting Cells
Unlike NK cells of the innate immune system B cells B lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that gives rise
to antibodies whereas T cells T lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in the
immune response T cells are a key component in the cellmediated responsethe specific immune response
that utilizes T cells to neutralize cells that have been infected with viruses and certain bacteria There are three
types of T cells cytotoxic helper and suppressor T cells Cytotoxic T cells destroy virusinfected cells in the
cellmediated immune response and helper T cells play a part in activating both the antibody and the cell
mediated immune responses Suppressor T cells deactivate T cells and B cells when needed and thus prevent
the immune response from becoming too intense
An antigen is a foreign or nonself macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system Not all antigens
will provoke a response For instance individuals produce innumerable self antigens and are constantly
exposed to harmless foreign antigens such as food proteins pollen or dust components The suppression of
immune responses to harmless macromolecules is highly regulated and typically prevents processes that could
be damaging to the host known as tolerance
The innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens and then inform the adaptive
immune response about the presence of these antigens An antigenpresenting cell APC is an immune
cell that detects engulfs and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection When a pathogen
is detected these APCs will phagocytose the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the
antigen Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC where they will serve as an
indicator to other immune cells Dendritic cells are immune cells that process antigen material they are present
in the skin Langerhans cells and the lining of the nose lungs stomach and intestines Sometimes a dendritic
cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response thus functioning as an antigen
presenting cell Macrophages also function as APCs Before activation and differentiation B cells can also
function as APCs
After
phagocytosis

APCs
the

vesicle
fuses
with

forming
phagolysosome Within the phagolysosome the components are broken down into fragments the fragments
are then loaded onto MHC class I or MHC class II molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen
presentation as illustrated in Figure 428 Note that T lymphocytes cannot properly respond to the antigen
unless it is processed and embedded in an MHC II molecule APCs express MHC on their surfaces and when
combined with a foreign antigen these complexes signal a nonself invader Once the fragment of antigen is
embedded in the MHC II molecule the immune cell can respond Helper T cells are one of the main lymphocytes
