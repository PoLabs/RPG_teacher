KEY TERMS
process by which inorganic carbon is fixed by photosynthetic species that then die
and fall to the sea floor where they cannot be reached by saprobes and their carbon dioxide consumption
cannot be returned to the atmosphere
generation and emission of light by an organism as in dinoflagellates
vesicle that fills with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contracts to squeeze
water from the cell an osmoregulatory vesicle
movement of cytoplasm into an extended pseudopod such that the entire cell is
transported to the site of the pseudopod
engulfment of one cell within another such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells
benefit the process responsible for the evolution of mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotes
theory that states that eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing
another one living within another and evolving over time until the separate cells were no longer
recognizable as such
organelle carried by parabasalids Excavata that functions anaerobically and outputs
hydrogen gas as a byproduct likely evolved from mitochondria
mass of DNA carried within the single oversized mitochondrion characteristic of kinetoplastids
phylum Euglenozoa
nonfunctional organelle carried in the cells of diplomonads Excavata that likely evolved from a
mitochondrion
organism that can obtain nutrition by autotrophic or heterotrophic means usually facultatively
outer cell covering composed of interlocking protein strips that function like a flexible coat of armor
preventing cells from being torn or pierced without compromising their range of motion
cellular body formed by the union of a phagosome containing the ingested particle with a
lysosome that contains hydrolytic enzymes
diverse group of mostly microscopic organisms that drift in marine and freshwater systems and serve
as a food source for larger aquatic organisms
one of a group of related organelles in plant cells that are involved in the storage of starches fats
proteins and pigments
slit in the silica shell of diatoms through which the protist secretes a stream of mucopolysaccharides for
locomotion and attachment to substrates
porous shell of a foram that is built from various organic materials and typically hardened with calcium
carbonate
CHAPTER SUMMARY
231 Eukaryotic Origins
The oldest fossil evidence of eukaryotes is about 2 billion years old Fossils older than this all appear to be
prokaryotes It is probable that todays eukaryotes are descended from an ancestor that had a prokaryotic
organization The last common ancestor of todays Eukarya had several characteristics including cells with
nuclei and an endomembrane system which includes the nuclear envelope Its chromosomes were linear and
contained DNA associated with histones The nuclear genome seems to be descended from an archaean
ancestor This ancestor would have had a cytoskeleton and divided its chromosomes mitotically
The ancestral cytoskeletal system included the ability to make ciliaflagella during at least part of its life cycle It
