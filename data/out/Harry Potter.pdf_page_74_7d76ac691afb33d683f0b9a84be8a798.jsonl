the barrier
Yes please Harry panted
Oy Fred Cmere and help
With the twins help Harrys trunk was at last tucked away in a corner
of the compartment
Thanks said Harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes
Whats that said one of the twins suddenly pointing at Harrys
lightning scar
Blimey said the other twin Are you
He is said the first twin Arent you he added to Harry
What said Harry
Harry Potter chorused the twins
Oh him said Harry I mean yes I am
The two boys gawked at him and Harry felt himself turning red Then to
his relief a voice came floating in through the trains open door
Fred George Are you there
Coming Mom
With a last look at Harry the twins hopped off the train
Harry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the
redhaired family on the platform and hear what they were saying Their
mother had just taken out her handkerchief
Ron youve got something on your nose
The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she grabbed him and
began rubbing the end of his nose
Mom  geroff He wriggled free
