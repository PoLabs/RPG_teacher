The Adventure of the Engineers Thumb
had three consultations and one small job and that is
absolutely all that my profession has brought me My
gross takings amount to 27 10s Every day from nine
in the morning until four in the afternoon I waited
in my little den until at last my heart began to sink
and I came to believe that I should never have any
practice at all
Yesterday however just as I was thinking of leav
ing the ofce my clerk entered to say there was a
gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon busi
ness He brought up a card too with the name of
Colonel Lysander Stark engraved upon it Close at
his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over
the middle size but of an exceeding thinness I do
not think that I have ever seen so thin a man His
whole face sharpened away into nose and chin and
the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his
outstanding bones Yet this emaciation seemed to be
his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye
was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured He
was plainly but neatly dressed and his age I should
judge would be nearer forty than thirty
 Mr Hatherley said he with something of a
German accent You have been recommended to me
Mr Hatherley as being a man who is not only pro
cient in his profession but is also discreet and capable
of preserving a secret
I bowed feeling as attered as any young man
would at such an address May I ask who it was who
gave me so good a character
 Well perhaps it is better that I should not tell
you that just at this moment I have it from the same
source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor
and are residing alone in London
 That is quite correct I answered but you will
excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears
upon my professional qualications I understand
that it was on a professional matter that you wished
to speak to me
 Undoubtedly so But you will nd that all I
say is really to the point I have a professional com
mission for you but absolute secrecy is quite essen
tialabsolute secrecy you understand and of course
we may expect that more from a man who is alone
than from one who lives in the bosom of his family
 If I promise to keep a secret said I you may
absolutely depend upon my doing so
He looked very hard at me as I spoke and it
seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and
questioning an eye
 Do you promise then said he at last
 Yes I promise
 Absolute and complete silence before during
and after No reference to the matter at all either in
word or writing
 I have already given you my word
 Very good He suddenly sprang up and dart
ing like lightning across the room he ung open the
door The passage outside was empty
 Thats all right said he coming back I know
that clerks are sometimes curious as to their masters
affairs Now we can talk in safety He drew up his
chair very close to mine and began to stare at me
again with the same questioning and thoughtful look
A feeling of repulsion and of something akin to
fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics
of this eshless man Even my dread of losing a client
could not restrain me from showing my impatience
 I beg that you will state your business sir said
I my time is of value Heaven forgive me for that
last sentence but the words came to my lips
 How would fty guineas for a nights work suit
you he asked
 Most admirably
 I say a nights work but an hours would be
nearer the mark I simply want your opinion about
a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of
gear If you show us what is wrong we shall soon
set it right ourselves What do you think of such a
commission as that
 The work appears to be light and the pay mu
nicent
 Precisely so We shall want you to come tonight
by the last train
 Where to
 To Eyford in Berkshire It is a little place near
the borders of Oxfordshire and within seven miles
of Reading There is a train from Paddington which
would bring you there at about 1115
 Very good
 I shall come down in a carriage to meet you
 There is a drive then
 Yes our little place is quite out in the country It
is a good seven miles from Eyford Station
 Then we can hardly get there before midnight I
suppose there would be no chance of a train back I
should be compelled to stop the night
 Yes we could easily give you a shakedown
 That is very awkward Could I not come at some
more convenient hour
