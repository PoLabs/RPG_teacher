KEY TERMS
tubular digestive system with a mouth and anus
protease that breaks down peptides to single amino acids secreted by the brush border of
small intestine
exit point for waste material
digestive juice produced by the liver important for digestion of lipids
mass of food resulting from chewing action and wetting by saliva
protease that breaks down peptides to single amino acids secreted by the brush border of
the small intestine
animal that consumes animal flesh
first phase of digestion controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food
hormone that stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder to release bile
small lipid globule
mixture of partially digested food and stomach juices
pancreatic protease
mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into small organic fragments
protease that breaks down peptides to single amino acids secreted by the brush border of small
intestine
first part of the small intestine where a large part of digestion of carbohydrates and fats occurs
pancreatic protease
system that controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of
hormones at the appropriate times
tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach
nutrient that cannot be synthesized by the body it must be obtained from food
organ that stores and concentrates bile
hormone secreted by the small intestine in the presence of fatty acids and sugars it
also inhibits acid production and peristalsis in order to slow down the rate at which food enters the small
intestine
digestive phase beginning once food enters the stomach gastric acids and enzymes process the
ingested materials
hormone which stimulates hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach
digestive system consisting of a single opening
muscular organ that grinds food
animal that consumes a strictly plant diet
last part of the small intestine connects the small intestine to the large intestine important for absorption
