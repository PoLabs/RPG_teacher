move to industry Others have argued instead that it was the relatively highpaid 
industrial activities which pulled people from the countryside to cities which 
in turn forced the agricultural sector to modernise and mechanise a process 
which even further accelerated urbanisation No matter the exact causation 
economic structures in most European countries changed dramatically 
During later stages of industrialisation the service sector gained in importance 
as well Intensifying bureaucratisation boosted the demand for whitecollar 
workers such as secretaries which opened up new jobs for mostly young 
unmarried women Moreover improved methods of communication
including railroads and the telegraphcreated new possibilities for the global 
movement of people products and ideas which likewise expanded work in 
the service sector 
These economic changes also had major consequences for the ways in which 
labour was organised Manufacturing was largely displaced from homes and 
small workshops and moved to large factories Modern machinery simply 
took up too much space and required vast capital investments something 
only wealthy entrepreneurs could do Consequently an increasing number of 
labourers became dependent on wage labour as opposed to their own means 
of production With the spread of the factory system the production process 
became more specialised and formalised One worker became responsible for 
only one specific part of the production process a system which significantly 
lowered the costs of labour Seeing that labour was increasingly concentrated in 
factories it was possible to coordinate a specialised work force These changes 
initially met resistance from labourers the Luddites a famous example were 
a group of textile workers who destroyed machinery because they felt the 
equipment would make their skills useless
Even though most European economies grew significantly as a result of 
their growing manufacturing sectors there were serious downsides to these 
developments As a result of rapid urbanisation and population growth 
living conditions in exploding factory cities such as the English textile city 
of Manchester were very poor In Manchester the small houses which 
sheltered the new industrial workers were built closely together and lacked 
proper sanitation systems or clean drinking water The working conditions 
in factories were equally bad with unhygienic working environments and 
insufficient regard for workers safety Moreover poverty and unemployment 
were widespread The dismal working and living conditions of the working 
class could at a certain point no longer be ignored by governments or higher 
social classes It came to be seen as a problem to be solved and was referred 
to as the social question Protective legislation was one of the ways in which 
governments tried to improve the living standards of the working class The 
first laws were designed to protect women and children curtailing their
