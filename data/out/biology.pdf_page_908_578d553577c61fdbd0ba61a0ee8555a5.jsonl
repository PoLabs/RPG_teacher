CHAPTER SUMMARY
291 Chordates
The five characteristic features of chordates present during some time of their life cycles are a notochord a
dorsal hollow tubular nerve cord pharyngeal slits endostylethyroid gland and a postanal tail Chordata
contains two clades of invertebrates Urochordata tunicates and Cephalochordata lancelets together with
the vertebrates in the VertebrataCraniata Lancelets are suspension feeders that feed on phytoplankton and
other microorganisms Most tunicates live on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders Which of the two
invertebrate chordate clades is more closely related to the vertebrates continues to be debated Vertebrata is
named for the vertebral column which is a feature of almost all members of this clade The name Craniata
organisms with a cranium is considered to be synonymous with Vertebrata
292 Fishes
The earliest vertebrates that diverged from the invertebrate chordates were the agnathan jawless fishes whose
extant members include the hagfishes and lampreys Hagfishes are eellike scavengers that feed on dead
invertebrates and other fishes Lampreys are characterized by a toothed funnellike sucking mouth and most
species are parasitic or predaceous on other fishes Fishes with jaws gnathostomes evolved later Jaws
allowed early gnathostomes to exploit new food sources
Gnathostomes include the cartilaginous fishes and the bony fishes as well as all other tetrapods amphibians
reptiles mammals Cartilaginous fishes include sharks rays skates and ghost sharks Most cartilaginous
fishes live in marine habitats with a few species living in fresh water for part or all of their lives The vast
majority of presentday fishes belong to the clade Osteichthyes which consists of approximately 30000
species Bony fishes Osteichthyes can be divided into two clades Actinopterygii rayfinned fishes virtually all
extant species and Sarcopterygii lobefinned fishes comprising fewer than 10 extant species but form the
sister group of the tetrapods
293 Amphibians
As tetrapods most amphibians are characterized by four welldeveloped limbs although some species of
salamanders and all caecilians are limbless The most important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist
permeable skin used for cutaneous respiration although lungs are found in the adults of many species
All amphibians are carnivores and possess many small teeth The fossil record provides evidence of amphibian
species now extinct that arose over 400 million years ago as the first tetrapods Living Amphibia can be
divided into three classes salamanders Urodela frogs Anura and caecilians Apoda In the majority of
amphibians development occurs in two distinct stages a gilled aquatic larval stage that metamorphoses into
an adult stage acquiring lungs and legs and losing the tail in Anurans A few species in all three clades bypass
a freeliving larval stage Various levels of parental care are seen in the amphibians
294 Reptiles
The amniotes are distinguished from amphibians by the presence of a terrestrially adapted egg protected by
