the first official treaty codifying international humanitarian law in 1820 up 
until the Hague Convention of 1907 and the Nuremberg Tribunals of 1945 
a juridification of customary laws of conduct in war of permissive rights 
and prohibitive rights was formulated According to the classic Whiggish 
viewpoint this development was the outcome of a process driven by 
universalist ambitions and human rights ideals Yet it could also be considered 
a contingent and openended reconfiguration of imperial interests of public 
pressure of interstate and interempire competition and cooperation
up until the present day with the definition of terrorism being wielded by 
authoritarian and populist leaders as a stick with which to hit their domestic 
opposition 
In short this process is subject to ongoing contestations New types of

and imperialism between liberalism and conservativism and between 
communism and fascism was frequently the fuel of revolutions insurgencies
