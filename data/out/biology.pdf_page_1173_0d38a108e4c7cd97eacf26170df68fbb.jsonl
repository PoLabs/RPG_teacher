Figure 3714 The anterior pituitary stimulates the thyroid gland to release thyroid hormones T3 and T4 Increasing
levels of these hormones in the blood results in feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit
further signaling to the thyroid gland credit modification of work by Mikael Hggstrm
Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is overactive Hypothyroidism is a condition in
which the thyroid gland is underactive Which of the conditions are the following two patients most likely to
have
Patient A has symptoms including weight gain cold sensitivity low heart rate and fatigue
Patient B has symptoms including weight loss profuse sweating increased heart rate and difficulty
sleeping
Humoral Stimuli
The term humoral is derived from the term humor which refers to bodily fluids such as blood A humoral
stimulus refers to the control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood
or the ion concentration in the blood For example a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release
of insulin Insulin causes blood glucose levels to drop which signals the pancreas to stop producing insulin in a
negative feedback loop
Hormonal Stimuli
Hormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone A number of endocrine
glands release hormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands For example the
hypothalamus produces hormones that stimulate the anterior portion of the pituitary gland The anterior pituitary
