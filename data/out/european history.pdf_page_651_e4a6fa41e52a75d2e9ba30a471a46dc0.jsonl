Glass provides a second example It was used for a variety of purposes 
including windows and mirrors drinking vessels jewellery glass beads and 
household ornaments It has been estimated that the output of all French glass
makers increased four to five times between the middle of the seventeenth 
century and the French Revolution Italy was the first European region to 
develop a strong glass industry and Venice was its core Despite efforts by 
local authorities to prevent artisan migration the Venetian secrets were 
shared with other localities through migration and from the midfifteenth 
century also in writing Although Italian masters remained an important 
source of knowledge other countries became increasingly involved in the 
diffusion For example crown glass ie a thick round type of glass used for 
early windows was introduced in England by artisans from France in the 
midsixteenth century

Similar stories can be told about books paintings silk and other textiles 
porcelain and many other industrial consumer goods What enabled artisans 
to achieve these improvements One important factor must have been 
apprenticeships Crafts were taught individually under a contract settled 
between a master craftsman and hissometimes herapprentice Guilds 
were increasingly setting rules for the training of young artisans Gradually a 
model emerged that was also followed for apprenticeships outside the realm 
of incorporated trades This model was relatively uniform throughout Europe 
Apprentices travel compulsory in some countries and the temporary and 
permanent migration of fully qualified artisans ensured that best practices 
were shared between production centres
