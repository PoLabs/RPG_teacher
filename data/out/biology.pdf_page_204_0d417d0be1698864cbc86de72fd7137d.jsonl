KEY TERMS
energy necessary for reactions to occur
enzymes specific region to which the substrate binds
inhibition by a binding event at a site different from the active site which induces a
conformational change and reduces the enzymes affinity for its substrate
also anabolism pathways that require an energy input to synthesize complex molecules from simpler
ones
adenosine triphosphate the cells energy currency
study of energy flowing through living systems
also catabolism pathways in which complex molecules break down into simpler ones
potential energy in chemical bonds that releases when those bonds are broken
small organic molecule such as a vitamin or its derivative which is required to enhance an enzymes
activity
inorganic ion such as iron and magnesium ions required for optimal enzyme activity regulation
type of inhibition in which the inhibitor competes with the substrate molecule by binding
to the enzymes active site
process that changes a subtances natural properties
describes chemical reactions that require energy input
a systems total energy
measure of randomness or disorder within a system
describes chemical reactions that release free energy
a products effect of a reaction sequence to decrease its further production by inhibiting the
first enzymes activity in the pathway that produces it
Gibbs free energy is the usable energy or energy that is available to do work
energy transferred from one system to another that is not work energy of the molecules motion or
particles
total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction
dynamic fit between the enzyme and its substrate in which both components modify their structures
to allow for ideal binding
energy type that takes place with objects or particles in motion
all the chemical reactions that take place inside cells including anabolism and catabolism
bond that connects phosphates in an ATP molecule
energy type that has the potential to do work stored energy
molecule on which the enzyme acts
study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter
