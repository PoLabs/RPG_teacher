Introduction
In Europe the early modern period was a time of societal transition from 
the traditional towards the modern Framed by the global expansion of 
European settlement driven by the rivalry between the great powers on the 
continent and by their efforts to discover and control new lands and resources 
at home and overseas the era witnessed the gradual formation of Europe It 
provided the conceptual and material base for European global dominance in 
the nineteenth century Scientific and technological change played a central 
if often overlooked part in this process which is usually described in terms 
of the expansion of capitalism and the related development of institutions 
and innovation cultures The invention development and dissemination of 
the printing press from the fifteenth century onwards as well as other early 
modern technologies reveal how science and technological change went 
handinhand and how knowledge about mathematics optics astronomy 
chemistry and medicine and the media used to convey it were evolving in 
tandem Arguably new knowledge cultures and associated technologies were 
an achievement from which large parts of the enlightened eighteenthcentury 
elites derived their selfconception embodying progress and modernity 
This chapter discusses some aspects of this transformation by exploring 
the emerging written culture and other infrastructures of knowledge 
technological networking across Europe the diffusion of innovations through 
migrant knowledge and industrialisation First we will look at the ways in 
which the printing press changed the infrastructure of knowledge Next we 
will discuss technological change and the role of migrating craftsmen in the 
diffusion of innovations Finally we will see how industrialisation was helped 
by inventions that were developed by craftsmen experimenting tinkers and
