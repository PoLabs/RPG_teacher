71 EXPERIMENTS AND AVANTGARDES
827
Both the religious groups of Bourignon and the Labadists included 
prominent members Scholars such as the AngloIrish natural philosopher 
and physicistchemist Robert Boyle the Moravian pedagogue philosopher 
and theologian Comenius and the Dutch biologist Jan Swammerdam were 
part of Bourignons spiritual movement whereas the founder of the Labadists 
Jean de Labadie 16101674 a French pietist who had originally been a 
Roman Catholic Jesuit priest attracted notable female converts such as the 
famed Dutch poet scholar and author of theological writings Anna Maria 
van Schurman Van Schurman 16071678 known as the learned and most 
noble virgin of Utrecht since she excelled in art music literature and was 
proficient in fourteen languages had already transgressed gender boundaries 
by becoming the first woman to study at a Dutch university in 1636 attending 
lectures behind a screen or in a curtained booth so that the male students could 
not see her
Thus these radical religious groups offered women ways to transgress the 
limitations that conventional religion and patriarchal society had imposed on 
them At the same time these sects also experimented with other forms of 
equality notably with regard to class Moreover these experiments crossed 
national boundaries with the help of epistolary networks partly overlapping 
with the scholarly republic of letters
De Sade and Sexual Freedom
Even though mainstream society often vented critique at these radical 
religious groups they had considerable freedom to experiment especially in 
the Dutch Republics political and cultural constellation of religious pluralism 
with freedom of press and conscience However the existing boundaries of 
religious and moral acceptability were definitely crossed by the French libertine 
author Marquis de Sade 17401814 Sade produced numerous novelsthe 
most infamous being the pornographic The 120 Days of Sodom or the School 
of Libertinage 1785as well as plays and pamphlets many of which have 
been burnt or lost because of their illicit content including sexual violence 
and torture Because of his writings and sexual abuse the French nobleman 
spent thirtytwo years of his life in various prisons and an insane asylum 
Sades thought was anchored in individual sexual religious and political 
freedom He pushed liberty to its extreme arguing for the freedom to rape 
and kill demonstrating a kind of moral skepticism and political relativism 
Sade has been regarded both as a cruel cynical misogynist and as an advocate 
of religious political and sexual freedom The aristocratic author underlined 
individualism and bodily desire thus also critiquing the Enlightenment focus 
on reason to battle religion and superstition
