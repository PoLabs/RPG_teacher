274 The Evolutionary History of the Animal Kingdom
The most rapid documented diversification and evolution of animal species in all of history occurred during the
Cambrian period of the Paleozoic Era a phenomenon known as the Cambrian explosion Until recently
scientists believed that there were only very few tiny and simplistic animal species in existence before this
period However recent fossil discoveries have revealed that additional larger and more complex animals
existed during the Ediacaran period and even possibly earlier during the Cryogenian period Still the
Cambrian period undoubtedly witnessed the emergence of the majority of animal phyla that we know today
although many questions remain unresolved about this historical phenomenon
The remainder of the Paleozoic Era is marked by the growing appearance of new classes families and
species and the early colonization of land by certain marine animals and semiaquatic arthropods both
freshwater and marine The evolutionary history of animals is also marked by numerous major extinction
events each of which wiped out a majority of extant species Some species of most animal phyla survived
these extinctions allowing the phyla to persist and continue to evolve into species that we see today
