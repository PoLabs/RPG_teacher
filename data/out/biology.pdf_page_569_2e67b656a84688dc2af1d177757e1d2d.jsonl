Introduction
Viruses are noncellular parasitic entities that cannot be classified within any kingdom They can infect organisms
as diverse as bacteria plants and animals In fact viruses exist in a sort of netherworld between a living
organism and a nonliving entity Living things grow metabolize and reproduce In contrast viruses are not
cellular do not have a metabolism or grow and cannot divide by cell division Viruses can copy or replicate
themselves however they are entirely dependent on resources derived from their host cells to produce progeny
viruseswhich are assembled in their mature form No one knows exactly when or how viruses evolved or
from what ancestral source because viruses have not left a fossil record Some virologists contend that modern
viruses are a mosaic of bits and pieces of nucleic acids picked up from various sources along their respective
evolutionary paths
211  Viral Evolution Morphology and Classification
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how viruses were first discovered and how they are detected

Discuss three hypotheses about how viruses evolved

Describe the general structure of a virus

Recognize the basic shapes of viruses

Understand past and emerging classification systems for viruses

Describe the basis for the Baltimore classification system
Viruses are diverse entities They vary in structure methods of replication and the hosts they infect Nearly all
forms of lifefrom prokaryotic bacteria and archaeans to eukaryotes such as plants animals and fungihave
viruses that infect them While most biological diversity can be understood through evolutionary history such as
