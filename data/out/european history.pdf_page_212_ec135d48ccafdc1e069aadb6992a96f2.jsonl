While ethnic diversity in Eastern and Central European states was 
commonplace before 1918 the Versailles System established after the First 
World War created radically new conditions The dissolution of the multi
ethnic empires AustriaHungary Russia Wilhelmine Germany the Ottoman 
Empire was followed by the emergence of successor states whose legitimacy 
derived from the principle of national selfdetermination But the new states 
were far from ethnically homogeneous units and many ethnic groups found 
themselves dispersed outside of their nationstates
Incongruencies between cultural and political borders fostered major 
tensions both within and beyond individual nations during the interwar 
period Domestically relationships were often strained between national 
minorities and the majority populations the socalled titular nations that 
became hegemons of their respective states At the same time national groups 
became bones of contention between the states in which they formed a minority 
such as Germans in Czechoslovakia or Hungarians in Romania and the states 
where they were dominant Germany Hungary 
Legal measures were created to secure the rights of national minorities 
such as those enshrined in the Minority Treaties that newly established states 
were obliged to sign in order to join the League of Nations The League served 
as arbitrator in cases of alleged mistreatment of minorities but cases could 
only be put forward by the recognised nationstates that were members of the 
organisation In practice many new states imposed the cultural dominance 
of the largest ethnic group and treated minorities that did not assimilate as 
unreliable or disloyal 
Some states such as Poland adopted harsh policies toward minorities 
enacting measures of cultural Polonisation while excluding minorities from 
state structures This especially applied to Ukrainians Belarussians Jews 
and Germans who together formed roughly one third of the population 
Czechoslovakia adopted a more liberal attitude towards its German Hungarian 
Ruthenian and Polish minorities but still regarded these groups demands 
for greater cultural or territorial autonomy with suspicion The peculiar and 
instrumental construction of a Czechoslovak nation itself concealed the 
unequal relationship between Czechs on the one hand and Slovaks on the 
other with the latter remaining underrepresented in state administration and 
public institutions 
Midcentury Transformations
The Second World War and its aftermath brought about a profound 
transformation of Central and Eastern Europes ethnic conditions The war 
itself triggered the flight and emigration of hundreds of thousands of people
