allows us to determine what is true and just and to liberate ourselves from 
prejudice and delusions 
The rise of ideology or ideologisation was part of what the German 
historian Reinhard Koselleck has defined as the Sattelzeit the transitional 
period between 1750 and 1850 when many people in Europe embraced the 
idea that a future society could be arranged on the basis of a rational blueprint 
independent from the traditions of the past Ideas thus became movements 
This is what is meant by the suffix ism as in liberalism conservatism 
socialism nationalism and so on a political movement with its own system 
of ideas and political culture from which emerges a programme that seeks to 
project itself towards a future horizon
The design of such a rational order relied on supposedly universal 
principles These entailed the idea derived from the English philosopher 
John Locke 16321704 and expounded by the French thinker JeanJacques 
Rousseau 17121778 that the rules of a civil government emanate from 
a social covenant between autonomous individuals with inalienable and 
equal human rights A second idea formulated by the French philosopher 
Montesquieu 16891755 specified that in order to limit any possible abuse of 
power the powers of the state are divided in a constitutional system of checks 
and balances between executive judicial and legislative powers Yet a third 
idea formulated by Rousseau but also by the German philosopher Johann 
Gottfried Herder 17441803 was that the power of the state emanated from 
and thus could be revoked by the sovereignty of the people A final idea 
formulated by Adam Smith 17231790 in The Wealth of Nations 1776 was 
that a prosperous society required civil liberties and a state that respected the 
freemarket principle of laissezfaire 
All of these ideas inspired the French revolutionaries to declare the rights of 
man and citizens to create a democratic constitution based on the sovereignty 
of the people and the rule of law and to abolish the aristocratic privileges 
and the guilds that stood in the way of a free market In order to preserve 
the accomplishments of the French Revolution Destutt de Tracy and like
minded thinkers gathered from 1795 onwards in the Society of Ideologues a 
looseknit group of people who met in the salon of AnneCatherine Helvtius 
17221800 Like some of the Enlightenment philosophers the ideologues 
assumed a leading political role with the conviction that a society ruled on 
the basis of rational principles and empirical knowledge was better served by 
an enlightened elite than by the fickle opinions of the people They welcomed 
Napoleon Bonaparte 17691821 who they saw as the forceful protector of the 
revolutionary spirit Yet Napoleon did not return the favour he introduced 
the pejorative use of the term ideologues and denoted those who criticised 
his encroachment on liberty and justice as metaphysicians intellectuals or
