the blood 74 are both very close to neutral However the environment in the stomach is highly acidic with a pH
of 1 to 2 As a result how do stomach cells survive in such an acidic environment How do they homeostatically
maintain the near neutral pH inside them The answer is that they cannot do it and are constantly dying The
stomach constantly produces new cells to replace dead ones which stomach acids digest Scientists estimate
that the human body completely replaces the stomach lining every seven to ten days

How can organisms whose bodies require a nearneutral pH ingest acidic and basic substances a human
drinking orange juice for example and survive Buffers are the key Buffers readily absorb excess H or OH
keeping the bodys pH carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival Maintaining a constant
blood pH is critical to a persons wellbeing The buffer maintaining the pH of human blood involves carbonic
acid H2CO3 bicarbonate ion HCO3 and carbon dioxide CO2 When bicarbonate ions combine with free
hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid it removes hydrogen ions and moderates pH changes Similarly as
Figure 220 shows excess carbonic acid can convert to carbon dioxide gas which we exhale through the lungs
This prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and dangerously reducing the bloods
pH Likewise if too much OH enters into the system carbonic acid will combine with it to create bicarbonate
lowering the pH Without this buffer system the bodys pH would fluctuate enough to put survival in jeopardy
