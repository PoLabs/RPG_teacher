attached to lipids or proteins are also on the plasma membranes exterior surface These carbohydrate
complexes help the cell bind required substances in the extracellular fluid This adds considerably to plasma
membranes selective nature Figure 57
Figure 57 The plasma membranes exterior surface is not identical to its interior surface
Recall that plasma membranes are amphiphilic They have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions This
characteristic helps move some materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others Non
polar and lipidsoluble material with a low molecular weight can easily slip through the membranes hydrophobic
lipid core Substances such as the fatsoluble vitamins A D E and K readily pass through the plasma
membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues Fatsoluble drugs and hormones also gain easy entry into
cells and readily transport themselves into the bodys tissues and organs Oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules
have no charge and pass through membranes by simple diffusion
Polar substances present problems for the membrane While some polar molecules connect easily with the
cells outside they cannot readily pass through the plasma membranes lipid core Additionally while small ions
could easily slip through the spaces in the membranes mosaic their charge prevents them from doing so Ions
such as sodium potassium calcium and chloride must have special means of penetrating plasma membranes
Simple sugars and amino acids also need the help of various transmembrane proteins channels to transport
themselves across plasma membranes
Diffusion
Diffusion is a passive process of transport A single substance moves from a high concentration to a low
concentration area until the concentration is equal across a space You are familiar with diffusion of substances
through the air For example think about someone opening a bottle of ammonia in a room filled with people
The ammonia gas is at its highest concentration in the bottle Its lowest concentration is at the rooms edges
The ammonia vapor will diffuse or spread away from the bottle and gradually increasingly more people will
smell the ammonia as it spreads Materials move within the cells cytosol by diffusion and certain materials
move through the plasma membrane by diffusion Figure 58 Diffusion expends no energy On the contrary
concentration gradients are a form of potential energy which dissipates as the gradient is eliminated
