Although the first commercial railway line was opened in 1812 the 
widespread use of trains for transport grew very gradually The establishment 
of the railways can be understood as a response to three different requirements 
Railways were a response to the demand for transport in countries or regions 
that were already well served by roads and canals but where there was strong 
traffic pressure on infrastructure This was the case in northwestern Europe 
where the first railway systems were built from the 1830s and 1840s 
Especially from the 1850s onwards trains were to serve as a deliberate 
solution to the problem of economic backwardnessas a response to the 
backwardness of the land transport system and the economy in general This 
was the case in Spain Russia southern Italy and western France Finally in 
the third case the train was perceived as a means of establishing a system of 
longdistance exchanges that would enable the national space to be structured 
and integrated into a larger European space This was the Portuguese project 
but also that of Belgium and the Netherlands State control of the railways 
was a guarantee of national independence and allowed the unification of the 
territory More generally whether in France Germany Switzerland or Italy 
the debates on railway routes revealed the dual ambition of achieving national 
unity and opening the country to trade 
This hierarchy of places and spaces was transformed rapidly by the mobile 
steam engine The movement of goods increased dramatically thanks to this 
transport revolution Between 1840 and 1870 freight costs fell by seventy percent 
in international trade This triggered a process of specialisation in the different 
regions of Europe between agricultural mining or industrial activities A more 
structured geographical landscape was created partly embedded in old spatial 
patterns The most industrialised and urbanised zone extended from the centre 
of England to the north of the Italian Peninsula passing through the Rhine 
and Rhone regions accompanied by a few more distant industrial districts 
for example in the Iberian Peninsula This concentration was redoubled by the 
means of transport maps of the expansion of the railways outline this area of 
greater density As the railway played an important role in the strengthening 
of central districts and regions it also conversely doomed others to decline 
Many onceprospering cities or whole regions faced deprivation when they 
were cut off from railway infrastructures and the economic opportunities they 
provided These new infrastructures could leverage the creation of national 
markets And what was more railways fostered internal and transnational 
migration on a whole new scale In search of opportunities people departed 
agricultural regions for industrial cities as well as mining and metallurgical 
regions 
The steam revolution of the nineteenth century did not only transform 
mainland Europe but it changed its relation to other parts of the world Its
