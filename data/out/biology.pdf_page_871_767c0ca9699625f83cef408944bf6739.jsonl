Figure 2916 Osteichthyes The a sockeye salmon and b coelacanth are both bony fishes of the Osteichthyes clade
The coelacanth sometimes called a lobefinned fish was thought to have gone extinct in the Late Cretaceous period
100 million years ago until one was discovered in 1938 near the Comoros Islands between Africa and Madagascar

293  Amphibians
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the important difference between the life cycle of amphibians and the life cycles of other
vertebrates

Distinguish between the characteristics of Urodela Anura and Apoda

Describe the evolutionary history of amphibians
Amphibians are vertebrate tetrapods four limbs and include frogs salamanders and caecilians The term
amphibian loosely translates from the Greek as dual life which is a reference to the metamorphosis that
many frogs and salamanders undergo and the unique mix of aquatic and terrestrial phases that are required in
their life cycle In fact they cannot stray far from water because their reproduction is intimately tied to aqueous
environments Amphibians evolved during the Devonian period and were the earliest terrestrial tetrapods They
represent an evolutionary transition from water to land that occurred over many millions of years Thus the
Amphibia are the only living true vertebrates that have made a transition from water to land in both their ontogeny
life development and phylogeny evolution They have not changed much in morphology over the past 350
million years
