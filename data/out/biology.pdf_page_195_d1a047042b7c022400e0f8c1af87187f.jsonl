more free energy than their reactants Within the cell from where does energy to power such reactions come
The answer lies with an energysupplying molecule scientists call adenosine triphosphate or ATP This is a
small relatively simple molecule Figure 613 but within some of its bonds it contains the potential for a quick
burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work Think of this molecule as the cells primary
energy currency in much the same way that money is the currency that people exchange for things they need
ATP powers the majority of energyrequiring cellular reactions
Figure 613 ATP is the cells primary energy currency It has an adenosine backbone with three phosphate groups
attached
As its name suggests adenosine triphosphate is comprised of adenosine bound to three phosphate groups
Figure 613 Adenosine is a nucleoside consisting of the nitrogenous base adenine and a fivecarbon sugar
ribose The three phosphate groups in order of closest to furthest from the ribose sugar are alpha beta and
gamma Together these chemical groups constitute an energy powerhouse However not all bonds within this
molecule exist in a particularly highenergy state Both bonds that link the phosphates are equally highenergy
bonds  phosphoanhydride bonds that when broken release sufficient energy to power a variety of cellular
reactions and processes These highenergy bonds are the bonds between the second and third or beta and
gamma phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups These bonds are highenergy
because the products of such bond breakingadenosine diphosphate ADP and one inorganic phosphate
group Pihave considerably lower free energy than the reactants ATP and a water molecule Because this
reaction takes place using a water molecule it is a hydrolysis reaction In other words ATP hydrolyzes into ADP
in the following reaction
ATP  H2 O ADP  Pi  free energy
Like most chemical reactions ATP to ADP hydrolysis is reversible The reverse reaction regenerates ATP from
ADP  Pi Cells rely on ATP regeneration just as people rely on regenerating spent money through some sort
of income Since ATP hydrolysis releases energy ATP regeneration must require an input of free energy This
equation expresses ATP formation
ADP  Pi  free energy ATP  H2 O
Two prominent questions remain with regard to using ATP as an energy source Exactly how much free energy
releases with ATP hydrolysis and how does that free energy do cellular work The calculated G for the
hydrolysis of one ATP mole into ADP and Pi is 73 kcalmole 305 kJmol Since this calculation is true under
standard conditions one would expect a different value exists under cellular conditions In fact the G for one
ATP moles hydrolysis in a living cell is almost double the value at standard conditions 14 kcalmol 57 kJ
mol
ATP is a highly unstable molecule Unless quickly used to perform work ATP spontaneously dissociates into
ADP  Pi and the free energy released during this process is lost as heat The second question we posed
above discusses how ATP hydrolysis energy release performs work inside the cell This depends on a strategy
scientists call energy coupling Cells couple the ATP hydrolysis exergonic reaction allowing them to proceed
One example of energy coupling using ATP involves a transmembrane ion pump that is extremely important
for cellular function This sodiumpotassium pump NaK pump drives sodium out of the cell and potassium
into the cell Figure 614 A large percentage of a cells ATP powers this pump because cellular processes
bring considerable sodium into the cell and potassium out of it The pump works constantly to stabilize cellular
concentrations of sodium and potassium In order for the pump to turn one cycle exporting three Na ions
