muskets the stadtholder Maurice managed to conquer several positions in 
Flanders and Brabant and even to beat the armies of the new Habsburg ruler 
Archduke Albert 15591621 at the Battle of Nieuwpoort 1600 By then 
the war in the Low Countries had become a chessboard in which infantry 
and cavalry galleys and galleons and above all strongholds and bastions 
designed on the mathematical trace italienne settled a conflict that would last 
for eight decades
Dynasticism and the Struggle for Continental Hegemony
These advances in military order and technology conditioned the conflicts 
that continued to emerge at the beginning of the seventeenth century 
Crucial elements of warfare were continuous with the preceding century 
Dynasticismthe preservation of a ruling familys territory and titles
continued to play a central role in international relations and therefore was 
indisputably the most common cause of war at least until the early eighteenth 
century The seventeenth century witnessed the consolidation of the fiscal
military state as well as a decisive shift in the balance of power on continental 
Europe from Habsburg Spanish and Austrian to Bourbon French English 
and Dutch hegemony The century also witnessed the Thirty Years War 1618

The Thirty Years War was the most lethal conflict Europe had seen 
until that date and would remain the most lethal until the World Wars of 
the twentieth century The outbreak of the Thirty Years War highlights 
the importance of two features central to early modern warfare dynastic 
inheritance and intractable religious conflict When the Austrian Habsburg 
heir Archduke Ferdinand 15781637 was crowned King of Bohemia in 
1617 he began curtailing the rights of Protestants which led to the revolt of 
the Estate of Bohemia The Protestant Frederick V 15961632 the Palatine 
Elector accepted the throne of the rebellious Estate of Bohemia a move that 
would have overturned the Catholic majority of the seven electors of the Holy 
Roman Empire The stage was set for a Europeanwide conflict as Archduke 
Ferdinand secured the support of the Spanish Habsburgs and many of the 
Catholic German states while Frederick V allied with the rulers of some of the 
most important Protestant territoriesTransylvania the United Provinces 
Brandenburg and several smaller Calvinist German states Frederick V also 
received more tenuous support from his fatherinlaw James I of England 
15661625 Christian IV of Denmark 15771648 and from the French the 
main dynastic rivals of the Habsburgs Although the role of confessional strife 
is clear in the outbreak and course of the Thirty Years War it should not be 
exaggerated either as the French Bourbons fought against the Spanish and
