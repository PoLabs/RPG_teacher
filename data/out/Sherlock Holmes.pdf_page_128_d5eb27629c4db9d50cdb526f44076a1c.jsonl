The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor
Indeed You say that there was a gentleman in
the pew Some of the general public were present
then
Oh yes It is impossible to exclude them when
the church is open
This gentleman was not one of your wifes
friends
No no I call him a gentleman by courtesy but
he was quite a commonlooking person I hardly no
ticed his appearance But really I think that we are
wandering rather far from the point
Lady St Simon then returned from the wedding
in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone
to it What did she do on reentering her fathers
house
I saw her in conversation with her maid
And who is her maid
Alice is her name She is an American and came
from California with her
A condential servant
A little too much so It seemed to me that her
mistress allowed her to take great liberties Still of
course in America they look upon these things in a
different way
How long did she speak to this Alice
Oh a few minutes I had something else to think
of
You did not overhear what they said
Lady St Simon said something about jumping a
claim She was accustomed to use slang of the kind
I have no idea what she meant
American slang is very expressive sometimes
And what did your wife do when she nished speak
ing to her maid
She walked into the breakfastroom
On your arm
No alone She was very independent in little
matters like that Then after we had sat down for
ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some
words of apology and left the room She never came
back
But this maid Alice as I understand deposes
that she went to her room covered her brides dress
with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out
Quite so And she was afterwards seen walk
ing into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar
a woman who is now in custody and who had al
ready made a disturbance at Mr Dorans house that
morning
Ah yes I should like a few particulars as to this
young lady and your relations to her
Lord St Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised
his eyebrows We have been on a friendly footing
for some yearsI may say on a very friendly foot
ing She used to be at the Allegro I have not treated
her ungenerously and she had no just cause of com
plaint against me but you know what women are Mr
Holmes Flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly
hotheaded and devotedly attached to me She wrote
me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about
to be married and to tell the truth the reason why
I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I
feared lest there might be a scandal in the church
She came to Mr Dorans door just after we returned
and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering
very abusive expressions towards my wife and even
threatening her but I had foreseen the possibility of
something of the sort and I had two police fellows
there in private clothes who soon pushed her out
again She was quiet when she saw that there was no
good in making a row
Did your wife hear all this
No thank goodness she did not
And she was seen walking with this very woman
afterwards
Yes That is what Mr Lestrade of Scotland Yard
looks upon as so serious It is thought that Flora
decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for
her
Well it is a possible supposition
You think so too
I did not say a probable one But you do not
yourself look upon this as likely
I do not think Flora would hurt a y
Still jealousy is a strange transformer of charac
ters Pray what is your own theory as to what took
place
Well really I came to seek a theory not to pro
pound one I have given you all the facts Since you
ask me however I may say that it has occurred to
me as possible that the excitement of this affair the
consciousness that she had made so immense a social
stride had the effect of causing some little nervous
disturbance in my wife
In short that she had become suddenly de
ranged
