152  Prokaryotic Transcription
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

List the different steps in prokaryotic transcription

Discuss the role of promoters in prokaryotic transcription

Describe how and when transcription is terminated
The prokaryotes which include Bacteria and Archaea are mostly singlecelled organisms that by definition lack
membranebound nuclei and other organelles A bacterial chromosome is a closed circle that unlike eukaryotic
chromosomes is not organized around histone proteins The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA
resides is called the nucleoid region In addition prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids which are shorter
circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes Plasmids can be transferred independently
of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as those involved with antibiotic
resistance
Transcription in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of
mRNA synthesis The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble Transcription always proceeds from
the same DNA strand for each gene which is called the template strand The mRNA product is complementary
to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand called the nontemplate strand or the
coding strand The only nucleotide difference is that in mRNA all of the T nucleotides are replaced with U
nucleotides Figure 157 In an RNA double helix A can bind U via two hydrogen bonds just as in AT pairing
in a DNA double helix
Figure 157 Messenger RNA is a copy of proteincoding information in the coding strand of DNA with the substitution
of U in the RNA for T in the coding sequence However new RNA nucleotides base pair with the nucleotides of the
template strand RNA is synthesized in its 53 direction using the enzyme RNA polymerase As the template is read
the DNA unwinds ahead of the polymerase and then rewinds behind it
The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5 mRNA nucleotide
is transcribed is called the 1 site or the initiation site Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are denoted with
a  and are designated upstream nucleotides Conversely nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted
with  numbering and are called downstream nucleotides
Initiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes
Prokaryotes do not have membraneenclosed nuclei Therefore the processes of transcription translation and
