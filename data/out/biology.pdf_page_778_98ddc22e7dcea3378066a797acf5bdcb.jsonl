While there are a great many genes that play roles in the morphological development of an animal including
other homeoboxcontaining genes what makes Hox genes so powerful is that they serve as master control
genes that can turn on or off large numbers of other genes Hox genes do this by encoding transcription factors
that control the expression of numerous other genes Hox genes are homologous across the animal kingdom
that is the genetic sequences of Hox genes and their positions on chromosomes are remarkably similar across
most animals because of their presence in a common ancestor from worms to flies mice and humans Figure
275 In addition the order of the genes reflects the anteriorposterior axis of the animals body One of the
contributions to increased animal body complexity is that Hox genes have undergone at least two and perhaps
as many as four duplication events during animal evolution with the additional genes allowing for more complex
body types to evolve All vertebrates have four or more sets of Hox genes while invertebrates have only one
set
Figure 275 Hox genes Hox genes are highly conserved genes encoding transcription factors that determine the
course of embryonic development in animals In vertebrates the genes have been duplicated into four clusters on
different chromosomes HoxA HoxB HoxC and HoxD Genes within these clusters are expressed in certain
body segments at certain stages of development Shown here is the homology between Hox genes in mice and
humans Note how Hox gene expression as indicated with orange pink blue and green shading occurs in the
same body segments in both the mouse and the human While at least one copy of each Hox gene is present in
humans and other vertebrates some Hox genes are missing in some chromosomal sets
If a Hox 13 gene in a mouse was replaced with a Hox 1 gene how might this alter animal development
Two of the five clades within the animal kingdom do not have Hox genes the Ctenophora and the Porifera
In spite of the superficial similarities between the Cnidaria and the Ctenophora the Cnidaria have a number
of Hox genes but the Ctenophora have none The absence of Hox genes from the ctenophores has led
to the suggestion that they might be basal animals in spite of their tissue differentiation Ironically the
Placozoa which have only a few cell types do have at least one Hox gene The presence of a Hox gene in
the Placozoa in addition to similarities in the genomic organization of the Placozoa Cnidaria and Bilateria
has led to the inclusion of the three groups in a Parahoxozoa clade However we should note that at this
time the reclassification of the Animal Kingdom is still tentative and requires much more study
