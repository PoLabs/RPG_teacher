CHAPTER SUMMARY
331 Animal Form and Function
Animal bodies come in a variety of sizes and shapes Limits on animal size and shape include impacts to their
movement Diffusion affects their size and development Bioenergetics describes how animals use and obtain
energy in relation to their body size activity level and environment
332 Animal Primary Tissues
The basic building blocks of complex animals are four primary tissues These are combined to form organs
which have a specific specialized function within the body such as the skin or kidney Organs are organized
together to perform common functions in the form of systems The four primary tissues are epithelia
connective tissues muscle tissues and nervous tissues
333 Homeostasis
Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium that is maintained in body tissues and organs It is dynamic because it is
constantly adjusting to the changes that the systems encounter It is in equilibrium because body functions are
kept within a normal range with some fluctuations around a set point for the processes
VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS
1 Figure 3311 Which of the following statements
about types of epithelial cells is false
a
Simple columnar epithelial cells line the
tissue of the lung
b
Simple cuboidal epithelial cells are involved
in the filtering of blood in the kidney
c
Pseudostratisfied columnar epithilia occur in
a single layer but the arrangement of nuclei
makes it appear that more than one layer is
present
d
Transitional epithelia change in thickness
depending on how full the bladder is
2 Figure 3321 State whether each of the following
processes are regulated by a positive feedback loop
or a negative feedback loop
a
A person feels satiated after eating a large
meal
b
The blood has plenty of red blood cells As a
result erythropoietin a hormone that
stimulates the production of new red blood
cells is no longer released from the kidney
3 Figure 3323 When bacteria are destroyed by
leuckocytes pyrogens are released into the blood
Pyrogens reset the bodys thermostat to a higher
