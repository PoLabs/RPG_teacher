They say said another looking viciously at Hook that when he
comes its in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard
Had he a hook captain asked Cookson insolently and one
after another took up the cry The ships doomed At this the
children could not resist raising a cheer Hook had wellnigh
forgotten his prisoners but as he swung round on them now his face
lit up again
Lads he cried to his crew now heres a notion Open the cabin
door and drive them in Let them fight the doodledoo for their lives
If they kill him were so much the better if he kills them were
none the worse
For the last time his dogs admired Hook and devotedly they did
his bidding The boys pretending to struggle were pushed into the
cabin and the door was closed on them
Now listen cried Hook and all listened But not one dared to
face the door Yes one Wendy who all this time had been bound to
the mast It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was
watching it was for the reappearance of Peter
She had not long to wait In the cabin he had found the thing for
which he had gone in search the key that would free the children of
their manacles and now they all stole forth armed with such
weapons as they could find First signing them to hide Peter cut
Wendys bonds and then nothing could have been easier than for
them all to fly off together but one thing barred the way an oath
Hook or me this time So when he had freed Wendy he whispered
for her to conceal herself with the others and himself took her place
by the mast her cloak around him so that he should pass for her
Then he took a great breath and crowed
To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the
cabin and they were panicstricken Hook tried to hearten them but
like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs and he
knew that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him
Lads he said ready to cajole or strike as need be but never
quailing for an instant Ive thought it out Theres a Jonah aboard
Ay they snarled a man wi a hook
No lads no its the girl Never was luck on a pirate ship wi a
woman on board Well right the ship when shes gone
Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flints
Its worth trying they said doubtfully
Fling the girl overboard cried Hook and they made a rush at
the figure in the cloak
Theres none can save you now missy Mullins hissed jeeringly
Theres one replied the figure
Whos that
Peter Pan the avenger came the terrible answer and as he
spoke Peter flung off his cloak Then they all knew who twas that
had been undoing them in the cabin and twice Hook essayed to
speak and twice he failed In that frightful moment I think his fierce
heart broke
