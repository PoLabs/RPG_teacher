have told you before that he has more about him than you guess and you will
find that out before long So cheer up Bilbo and dont look so glum Cheer up
Thorin and Company This is your expedition after all Think of the treasure at
the end and forget the forest and the dragon at any rate until tomorrow
morning
When tomorrow morning came he still said the same So now there was
nothing left to do but to fill their waterskins at a clear spring they found close to
the forestgate and unpack the ponies They distributed the packages as fairly as

No no said Bilbo I didnt mean that I meant is there no way round
There is if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north

safe paths in this part of the world Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild
now and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go Before you could get round
