will rank as a result of Google picking up on your fresh content Think of it like a TV schedule 
that lets users know when yourshow is on so they know when to come back 
It also helps to delete videos that are not successful The amount of content you upload is also 
dependent on the service or product your brand offers and your video budget Its a careful 
balance of not overloading your channel with useless media and keeping content fresh and 
engaging

Its always essential to engage with your community Respond to any comments or questions 
in a timely manner and take feedback on your content into account when planning new videos 
There are millions of new videos being added every day and your audience will not necessarily 
stay hooked for very long That is why it is important to ensure that you engage with them to 
create a sense of community to relate to them and to show genuine interest

As with all digital marketing tactics in video marketing its essential to track and analyse data 
about your activities and then to optimise your strategy accordingly When creating video 
content use the various measurement options available to determine what you can do better 
going forward 
YouTube Analytics is a free tool that enables anyone with a YouTube account to view detailed 
statistics about the videos they upload to the site You can see how often videos are viewed as 
well as how popular they are relative to all videos in that market over a given period of time 
You can also delve deeper into the lifecycle of videos such as how long it takes for a video to 
become popular and what happens to video views as popularity peaks YouTube even breaks 
down the specific second when users stop watching the video
Using these metrics you can increase your videos view counts and improve popularity on 
the site For example you might learn that your videos are most popular on Wednesdays that 
they have a huge following in Spain or that new videos that play off previous content become 
more popular more quickly If you see users dropping off halfway into the video add a video 
card to mix things up There are many creative ways to approach this 
With this information you can concentrate on posting compelling fresh content that appeals 
to selected target audiences and post these videos on days when you know these viewers are 
on the site You could even go a step further and customise the video dubbing it in Spanish 
closed captions also support SEO efforts The range of possibilities to customise and optimise 
your content is limited only by the brands level of willingness 
Furthermore you can access a breakdown of how viewers discovered a specific video which 
can then be used to optimise the keywords tags and descriptions of videos
