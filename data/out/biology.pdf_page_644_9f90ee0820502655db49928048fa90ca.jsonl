similar to those of cyanobacteria As in mitochondria each chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes The
outer membrane is thought to be derived from the enclosing vacuole of the host and the inner membrane
is thought to be derived from the plasma membrane of the cyanobacterial endosymbiont In the group of
Archaeplastida called the glaucophytes and in the rhizarian Paulinella a thin peptidoglycan layer is still present
between the outer and inner plastid membranes All other plastids lack this relict of the cyanobacterial wall
There is also as with the case of mitochondria strong evidence that many of the genes of the endosymbiont
were transferred to the nucleus Plastids like mitochondria cannot live independently outside the host In
addition like mitochondria plastids are derived from the division of other plastids and never built from scratch
Researchers have suggested that the endosymbiotic event that led to Archaeplastida occurred 1 to 15 billion
years ago at least 5 hundred million years after the fossil record suggests that eukaryotes were present
Not all plastids in eukaryotes are derived directly from primary endosymbiosis Some of the major groups
of algae became photosynthetic by secondary endosymbiosis that is by taking in either green algae or red
algae both from Archaeplastida as endosymbionts Figure 234 Numerous microscopic and genetic studies
have supported this conclusion Secondary plastids are surrounded by three or more membranes and some
secondary plastids even have clear remnants of the nucleus nucleomorphs of endosymbiotic algae There are
even cases where tertiary or higherorder endosymbiotic events are the best explanations for the features of
some eukaryotic plastids

with photosynthetic cyanobacteria Scientists speculate that in a process called endosymbiosis an ancestral
prokaryote engulfed a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that evolved into modernday chloroplasts credit a
