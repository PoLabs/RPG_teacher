occur in different geographic locations with similar climates Temperature and precipitation and variations in
both are key abiotic factors that shape the composition of animal and plant communities in terrestrial biomes
Some biomes such as temperate grasslands and temperate forests have distinct seasons with cold weather
and hot weather alternating throughout the year In warm moist biomes such as the tropical wet forest net
primary productivity is high as warm temperatures abundant water and a yearround growing season fuel
plant growth and supply energy for high diversity throughout the food web Other biomes such as deserts and
tundras have low primary productivity due to extreme temperatures and a shortage of available water
444 Aquatic Biomes
Aquatic ecosystems include both saltwater and freshwater biomes The abiotic factors important for the
structuring of aquatic ecosystems can be different than those seen in terrestrial systems Sunlight is a driving
force behind the structure of forests and also is an important factor in bodies of water especially those that are
very deep because of the role of photosynthesis in sustaining certain organisms
Density and temperature shape the structure of aquatic systems Oceans may be thought of as consisting of
different zones based on water depth and distance from the shoreline and light penetrance Different kinds of
organisms are adapted to the conditions found in each zone Coral reefs are unique marine ecosystems that
are home to a wide variety of species Estuaries are found where rivers meet the ocean their shallow waters
provide nourishment and shelter for young crustaceans mollusks fishes and many other species Freshwater
biomes include lakes ponds rivers streams and wetlands Bogs are an interesting type of wetland
characterized by standing water lower pH and a lack of nitrogen
445 Climate and the Effects of Global Climate Change
The Earth has gone through periodic cycles of increases and decreases in temperature During the past 2000
years the Medieval Climate Anomaly was a warmer period while the Little Ice Age was unusually cool Both of
these irregularities can be explained by natural causes of changes in climate and although the temperature
changes were small they had significant effects Natural drivers of climate change include Milankovitch cycles
changes in solar activity and volcanic eruptions None of these factors however leads to rapid increases in
global temperature or sustained increases in carbon dioxide
The burning of fossil fuels is an important source of greenhouse gases which play a major role in the
greenhouse effect Two hundred and fifty million years ago global warming resulted in the Permian extinction
a largescale extinction event that is documented in the fossil record Currently modernday climate change is
associated with the increased melting of glaciers and polar ice sheets resulting in a gradual increase in sea
level Plants and animals can also be affected by global climate change when the timing of seasonal events
such as flowering or pollination is affected by global warming
