The Boscombe Valley Mystery
that
Witness It conveyed no meaning to me I
thought that he was delirious
The Coroner
What was the point upon
which you and your father had this nal quar
rel
Witness I should prefer not to answer
The Coroner I am afraid that I must press
it
Witness It is really impossible for me to tell
you I can assure you that it has nothing to
do with the sad tragedy which followed
The Coroner That is for the court to decide
I need not point out to you that your refusal to
answer will prejudice your case considerably
in any future proceedings which may arise
Witness I must still refuse
The Coroner I understand that the cry of
Cooee was a common signal between you and
your father
Witness It was
The Coroner How was it then that he ut
tered it before he saw you and before he even
knew that you had returned from Bristol
Witness with considerable confusion I do
not know
A Juryman
Did you see nothing which
aroused your suspicions when you returned
on hearing the cry and found your father fa
tally injured
Witness Nothing denite
The Coroner What do you mean
Witness I was so disturbed and excited as
I rushed out into the open that I could think
of nothing except of my father Yet I have a
vague impression that as I ran forward some
thing lay upon the ground to the left of me It
seemed to me to be something grey in colour
a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps When
I rose from my father I looked round for it but
it was gone
 Do you mean that it disappeared before you
went for help
 Yes it was gone
 You cannot say what it was
 No I had a feeling something was there
 How far from the body
 A dozen yards or so
 And how far from the edge of the wood
 About the same
 Then if it was removed it was while you
were within a dozen yards of it
 Yes but with my back towards it
This concluded the examination of the wit
ness
I see said I as I glanced down the column that the
coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe
upon young McCarthy He calls attention and with
reason to the discrepancy about his father having
signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal
to give details of his conversation with his father and
his singular account of his fathers dying words They
are all as he remarks very much against the son
Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched
himself out upon the cushioned seat Both you and
the coroner have been at some pains said he to sin
gle out the very strongest points in the young mans
favour Dont you see that you alternately give him
credit for having too much imagination and too little
Too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel
which would give him the sympathy of the jury too
much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness
anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat and
the incident of the vanishing cloth No sir I shall
approach this case from the point of view that what
this young man says is true and we shall see whither
that hypothesis will lead us And now here is my
pocket Petrarch and not another word shall I say of
this case until we are on the scene of action We lunch
at Swindon and I see that we shall be there in twenty
minutes
It was nearly four oclock when we at last after
passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley and over
the broad gleaming Severn found ourselves at the
pretty little countrytown of Ross A lean ferretlike
man furtive and slylooking was waiting for us upon
the platform In spite of the light brown dustcoat and
leatherleggings which he wore in deference to his
rustic surroundings I had no difculty in recognising
Lestrade of Scotland Yard With him we drove to
the Hereford Arms where a room had already been
engaged for us
I have ordered a carriage said Lestrade as we
sat over a cup of tea I knew your energetic nature
and that you would not be happy until you had been
on the scene of the crime
It was very nice and complimentary of you
Holmes answered It is entirely a question of baro
metric pressure
Lestrade looked startled I do not quite follow
he said
