Introduction
The demographic development of Europe in the twentieth century can be 
grasped by two indicators firstly the rate of natural demographic increase 
and decrease birth and death rates which was also shaped by external factors 
such as wars plagues and forced migrations secondly in order to explain 
the more intrinsic dynamics of demographic change in Europe all the other 
factors of the changing Human Development Index HDI must be taken into 
accountsuch as health knowledge education and economic wealth 
The demographic history of Europe in the twentieth century can be broken 
down into four periods according to three historical breaks 
The first phase pre1914 was characterised by a gradual decline in birth 
rates that had started to rise in the vast majority of European countries 
during the last three decades of the nineteenth century In less industrialised 
countries natality had recently peaked during the 1880s and 1890s Serbia 
Romania or at the beginning of the twentieth century Bulgaria The decline 
in the birth rate then culminated during the First World War 
The interwar period induced the second phase after a short wave of post
war compensatory births births postponed due to war the decades of the 
1920s and especially the 1930s were considered by many contemporaries to be 
an age of population depression
The third phase began with the post1945 baby boom which was particularly 
pronounced in most Western European countries although delayed in West 
Germany while behind the emerging Iron Curtain it was more moderate 
The considerably long period of economic growth after the Second World War 
and the benefits of the postwar welfare state provided better living conditions 
for families with children This also meant that people married earlier
