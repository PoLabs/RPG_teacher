39  THE RESPIRATORY
SYSTEM
Figure 391 Lungs which appear as nearly transparent tissue surrounding the heart in this Xray of a dog left are
the central organs of the respiratory system The left lung is smaller than the right lung to accommodate space for the
heart A dogs nose right has a slit on the side of each nostril When tracking a scent the slits open blocking the
front of the nostrils This allows the dog to exhale though the nowopen area on the side of the nostrils without losing
the scent that is being followed credit a modification of work by Geoff Stearns credit b modification of work by Cory

Introduction
Breathing is an involuntary event How often a breath is taken and how much air is inhaled or exhaled are
tightly regulated by the respiratory center in the brain Humans when they arent exerting themselves breathe
approximately 15 times per minute on average Canines like the dog in Figure 391 have a respiratory rate of
about 1530 breaths per minute With every inhalation air fills the lungs and with every exhalation air rushes
back out That air is doing more than just inflating and deflating the lungs in the chest cavity The air contains
oxygen that crosses the lung tissue enters the bloodstream and travels to organs and tissues Oxygen O2
enters the cells where it is used for metabolic reactions that produce ATP a highenergy compound At the same
time these reactions release carbon dioxide CO2 as a byproduct CO2 is toxic and must be eliminated Carbon
dioxide exits the cells enters the bloodstream travels back to the lungs and is expired out of the body during
exhalation
