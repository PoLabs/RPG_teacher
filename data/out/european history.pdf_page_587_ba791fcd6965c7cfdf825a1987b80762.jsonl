The Dutch and English East India Companies
Well before the late eighteenth century the Iberian empires were facing rivalry 
from aggressive intruders particularly England and the Dutch Republic The 
Dutch Revolt had robbed the city of Antwerp of its previous role channelling 
Mediterranean goods to northern Europe The exodus of Antwerps mercantile 
population northwards boosted the capital and expertise available to the 
new state the United Provinces of the Netherlands Commercial incentives 
for merchants to seek new routes to purchase goods from the Far East were 
further reinforced by the strategic desirability of interrupting Iberian traffic 
during the Dutch War of Independence from the Habsburg Empire In the late 
1590s a series of mercantile consortiums funded expeditions from different 
Dutch cities to the Far East enterprises that would in 1602 be amalgamated in 
a new organisation the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie VOC or the United 
Dutch East India Company This organisation followed Iberian precedents 
insofar as the Dutch States General endowed it with considerable monopoly 
privileges but differed by being funded through joint stock equity funding 
with around 1800 investors drawn to the initial share issuance This was a 
sign of how the preexistent stock market in government bonds had created 
an investing public Thus the VOC was extremely successful in enlisting 
private investment but this enterprise was closely associated with the Dutch 
state pursuing its war aims aggressively in the Far East by conquering such 
Portuguese bases as Malacca Violence was not only used against European 
rivals the inhabitants of the nutmegproducing Banda Islands were subject 
to near extermination when they reneged on supposed agreements to 
sell their product exclusively to the VOC which became a territorial ruler 
managing slavebased plantations Jayakarta part of the Banten Sultanate 
on the island of Java was also sacked by the VOC then becoming the site of 
its Asian headquarters Batavia Because of its importance to the Dutch war 
effort the VOC was required to be a perpetual entity with investors denied 
the opportunity to withdraw their stock although they could sell their shares
The relationship between the crown and the English East India Company 
EIC was less close than that between the VOC and the Dutch States General 
although the EIC did received royal privileges in the form of a charter granting 
monopoly trading rights and making it a corporation with the right to own 
property and take legal action independently of its members This was an 
extension of an established corporate tradition in England which encompassed 
the regulation of overseas trade with companies acting as the governmental 
framework to engender cooperation amongst independent merchants What 
distinguished the EIC from most other companies was its joint stock although 
this was not referenced explicitly in its founding charter Instead members were
