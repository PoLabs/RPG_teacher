Figure 3035 Plants are suited to their local environment a Xerophytes like this prickly pear cactus Opuntia
sp and b epiphytes such as this tropical Aeschynanthus perrottetii have adapted to very limited water resources
The leaves of a prickly pear are modified into spines which lowers the surfacetovolume ratio and reduces water
loss Photosynthesis takes place in the stem which also stores water b A perottetii leaves have a waxy cuticle
that prevents water loss c Goldenrod Solidago sp is a mesophyte well suited for moderate environments d
Hydrophytes like this fragrant water lily Nymphaea odorata are adapted to thrive in aquatic environments credit

Xerophytes and epiphytes often have a thick covering of trichomes or of stomata that are sunken below the leafs
surface Trichomes are specialized hairlike epidermal cells that secrete oils and substances These adaptations
impede air flow across the stomatal pore and reduce transpiration Multiple epidermal layers are also commonly
found in these types of plants
Transportation of Photosynthates in the Phloem
Plants need an energy source to grow In seeds and bulbs food is stored in polymers such as starch that are
converted by metabolic processes into sucrose for newly developing plants Once green shoots and leaves are
growing plants are able to produce their own food by photosynthesizing The products of photosynthesis are
called photosynthates which are usually in the form of simple sugars such as sucrose
Structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources Sugars produced in
sources such as leaves need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called
translocation The points of sugar delivery such as roots young shoots and developing seeds are called
sinks Seeds tubers and bulbs can be either a source or a sink depending on the plants stage of development
and the season
