CHAPTER SUMMARY
41 Studying Cells
A cell is the smallest unit of life Most cells are so tiny that we cannot see them with the naked eye Therefore
scientists use microscopes to study cells Electron microscopes provide higher magnification higher resolution
and more detail than light microscopes The unified cell theory states that one or more cells comprise all
organisms the cell is the basic unit of life and new cells arise from existing cells
42 Prokaryotic Cells
Prokaryotes are singlecelled organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea All prokaryotes have plasma
membranes cytoplasm ribosomes and DNA that is not membranebound Most have peptidoglycan cell walls
and many have polysaccharide capsules Prokaryotic cells range in diameter from 01 to 50 m
As a cell increases in size its surface areatovolume ratio decreases If the cell grows too large the plasma
membrane will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased
volume
43 Eukaryotic Cells
Like a prokaryotic cell a eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane cytoplasm and ribosomes but a eukaryotic
cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell has a true nucleus meaning a membrane surrounds its DNA and
has other membranebound organelles that allow for compartmentalizing functions The plasma membrane is a
phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins The nucleuss nucleolus is the site of ribosome assembly We
find ribosomes either in the cytoplasm or attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or
endoplasmic reticulum They perform protein synthesis Mitochondria participate in cellular respiration They
are responsible for the majority of ATP produced in the cell Peroxisomes hydrolyze fatty acids amino acids
and some toxins Vesicles and vacuoles are storage and transport compartments In plant cells vacuoles also
help break down macromolecules
Animal cells also have a centrosome and lysosomes The centrosome has two bodies perpendicular to each
other the centrioles and has an unknown purpose in cell division Lysosomes are the digestive organelles of
animal cells
Plant cells and plantlike cells each have a cell wall chloroplasts and a central vacuole The plant cell wall
whose primary component is cellulose protects the cell provides structural support and gives the cell shape
Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts The central vacuole can expand without having to produce more
cytoplasm
44 The Endomembrane System and Proteins
The endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope lysosomes vesicles the ER and Golgi apparatus
as well as the plasma membrane These cellular components work together to modify package tag and
transport proteins and lipids that form the membranes
The RER modifies proteins and synthesizes phospholipids in cell membranes The SER synthesizes
carbohydrates lipids and steroid hormones engages in the detoxification of medications and poisons and
stores calcium ions Sorting tagging packaging and distributing lipids and proteins take place in the Golgi
apparatus Budding RER and Golgi membranes create lysosomes Lysosomes digest macromolecules recycle
wornout organelles and destroy pathogens
45 The Cytoskeleton
The cytoskeleton has three different protein element types From narrowest to widest they are the
microfilaments actin filaments intermediate filaments and microtubules Biologists often associate
microfilaments with myosin They provide rigidity and shape to the cell and facilitate cellular movements
Intermediate filaments bear tension and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place Microtubules help
the cell resist compression serve as tracks for motor proteins that move vesicles through the cell and pull
replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell They are also the structural element of centrioles
flagella and cilia
