New Waves NeoAvantGarde and After
In the 1960s a new wave of the avantgarde emerged in both Western and 
Eastern Europe with less clearcut political connotations but still with a clear 
orientation to progressive principles and an oppositional attitude toward 
anything representing the mainstream
The parallel movements of the nouveau roman new novel in literature 
and nouveau ralisme new realism in the arts in France are typical 
exponents of neoavantgarde of the late 1950s and early 1960s The main idea 
was to distance themselves from traditional writing and the arts Conceptual 
art also followed suit with Fluxus a loose group of neoavantgardist artists 
on both sides of the Atlantic from the mid1960s on trying to bypass the 
commercialised art world by putting their emphasis on thought processes and 
production modes as inherent parts of the artwork Fluxus artworks often had 
a sociopolitical dimension and they were habitually left unfinished making 
their sale or exhibition difficult On the opposite side of the spectrum pop 
artespecially Andy Warhols serialisationscame to symbolise a globalised 
cultural industry Nevertheless they were often regarded as connected to the 
conceptual thinking of the abovementioned Duchamp making a conspicuous 
albeit clear contribution to neoavantgarde art
