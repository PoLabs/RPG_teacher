Many important elements in the modernisation of society and public 
administration have spread through much of Europe via the Napoleonic 
Code This preserved the enlightened absolutist practice of excluding 
churches as institutions from state administration The application of human 
rights resisted the prescription of state religion because all are born with the 
freedom to follow any religion The modern bourgeois state is thus neutral in 
matters of faith and regards churches as private societies supported by their 
faithful Citizens on the other hand are free to form political organisations 
parties associations advertise them in the press and so on
The success of this model is evidenced by the history of Belgium When the 
Dutch Protestants oppressed the Belgian Catholics they teamed up with the 
Belgian Liberals unio to fight for universal religious freedombecause if all 
religions were free the Catholic religion would be free too Thus the unionism 
of the Belgian Revolution in 1830 liberated the Catholics and brought about 
the modern freedom of religions In the first half of the nineteenth century 
however the papacy rejected the political cooperation of liberals and Catholics 
The popes supported the Holy Alliance 1815 in which the armies of the 
absolutist powersRussia Austria and Prussiaoppressed the national and 
liberal movements It was for this reason that the pope did not protest when 
Orthodox Russia defeated the Catholic Poles during the November Uprising 
in 1831
This Catholic restoration was also aided by the new religious sensibilities 
intertwined with romanticism new waves of the cult of Virgin Mary new 
regulated companies and orders of monks etc that emerged in the first half of 
the nineteenth century against the prevailing rationalism of the Enlightenment 
and the French Revolution FranoisRen de Chateaubriand 17681848 the 
immensely popular romantic writer presented in The Genius of Christianity 
1802 a powerful argument for Christianity based on the aesthetic values 
of past Christian centuries it supported for example the Gothic Revival 
in architecture and the Nazarene School in painting On the basis of the 
restoration of the Roman Papal State there arose a new political ideology called 
Ultramontanism literally beyond the mountains Its believers generally 
refused the compromise with the liberal states and were militantly loyal to the 
pope as the supreme authority in matters of faith and practice 
 The inspiring encounter of romanticism and religion strengthened 
restoration efforts Liberal thinkers did not accept that the idea of liberating 
individuals and peoples would be hostile to the Christian tradition Flicit 
Robert de Lamennais 17821854 gradually moved away from his earlier 
hopes for an alliance between Ultramontanism and royalism When in 1830 he 
founded the newspaper LAvenir the forum of liberal Catholics his cause was 
to promote liberty for the Church from the state Lamennais and his followers
