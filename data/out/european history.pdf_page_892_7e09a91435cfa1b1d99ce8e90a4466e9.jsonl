telegraph and photography helped to open up new ways of imagining the 
world allowing individuals to view their own local experiences in the much 
broader contexts of national transnational or even global belonging At the 
same time the use of individual media created new forms of spatialisation 
with people socialising in literary salons reading the newspaper at home or 
communicating with one another via the telegraph
New information and communication technologies as well as new forms 
of travel and increased mobility found their way into popular discourse and 
became topics of some of the bestselling books of the era For example in 
his 1872 novel Le Tour du monde en quatrevingts jourswhich was rapidly 
translated into English German and other languagesthe French author 
Jules Verne 18281905 depicted a British gentleman who made a bet that 
he would be able to travel the world in eighty days Starting from his local 
London gentlemens club the readership of Vernes novel followed its hero on 
his journey around the globe 
Fascinated readers were introduced to both modern and exotic means of 
transportation but also to the newest forms of communication which often 
played an important part in the plot The telegraph featured prominently 
in the book creating a sense of connectedness between the British Empires 
centre in London and various other stations around the world The very fact 
that the story started in an armchair in a gentlemens club in London from 
where it linked the Mediterranean the Indian Subcontinent the Far East the 
United States of America and several other places together was mirrored in 
the experience of the novels many European and international readers while 
reading the book itself 
The use of media and its capacity to reorganise the experience and meaning 
of the world had a long past During the French Revolution a prominent 
cultural practice was reading placards and looking at the latestoften 
satiricalillustrations In fact the new symbolic order of the French Republic 
emerged from the dissemination and reception of a vast number of emblematic 
publications which combined written information with easily identifiable and 
formative visual content The expansion and increasing importance of public 
communication during the revolution helped to establish a transnational mode 
of observation that addressed mass audiences in many different countries This 
process relied on and developed new or reinvigorated print industry networks 
and newly established illustrated magazines like The Illustrated London News 
Photography soon became one of the most important media which established 
a new mode not only of knowing the world but also which inspired feelings 
of solidarity or hostility toward people across the globe
At the same time the reorganisation of the perception of the world did not 
mean that the nineteenth century only witnessed an evergrowing expansion
