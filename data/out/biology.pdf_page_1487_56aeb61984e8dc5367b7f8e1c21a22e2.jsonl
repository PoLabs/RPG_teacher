The Biogeochemical Carbon Cycle
The movement of carbon through the land water and air is complex and in many cases it occurs much more
slowly geologically than as seen between living organisms Carbon is stored for long periods in what are known
as carbon reservoirs which include the atmosphere bodies of liquid water mostly oceans ocean sediment
soil land sediments including fossil fuels and the Earths interior
As stated the atmosphere is a major reservoir of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and is essential to the
process of photosynthesis The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir
of carbon in the oceans The exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how
much carbon is found in each location and each one affects the other reciprocally Carbon dioxide CO2 from
the atmosphere dissolves in water and combines with water molecules to form carbonic acid and then it ionizes
to carbonate and bicarbonate ions Figure 4616
Figure 4616 Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form bicarbonate and carbonate ions
The equilibrium coefficients are such that more than 90 percent of the carbon in the ocean is found as
bicarbonate ions Some of these ions combine with seawater calcium to form calcium carbonate CaCO3 a
major component of marine organism shells These organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor
Over geologic time the calcium carbonate forms limestone which comprises the largest carbon reservoir on
Earth
On land carbon is stored in soil as a result of the decomposition of living organisms by decomposers or from
weathering of terrestrial rock and minerals This carbon can be leached into the water reservoirs by surface
runoff Deeper underground on land and at sea are fossil fuels the anaerobically decomposed remains of
plants that take millions of years to form Fossil fuels are considered a nonrenewable resource because their
use far exceeds their rate of formation A nonrenewable resource such as fossil fuel is either regenerated
very slowly or not at all Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land including land beneath the
surface of the ocean by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems Carbon sediments from the
ocean floor are taken deep within the Earth by the process of subduction the movement of one tectonic plate
beneath another Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal
vents
Humans contribute to atmospheric carbon by the burning of fossil fuels and other materials Since the Industrial
Revolution humans have significantly increased the release of carbon and carbon compounds which has in
turn affected the climate and overall environment
Animal husbandry by humans also increases atmospheric carbon The large numbers of land animals raised to
feed the Earths growing population results in increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere due to farming
practices and respiration and methane production This is another example of how human activity indirectly
affects biogeochemical cycles in a significant way Although much of the debate about the future effects of
increasing atmospheric carbon on climate change focuses on fossils fuels scientists take natural processes
such as volcanoes and respiration into account as they model and predict the future impact of this increase
The Nitrogen Cycle
Getting nitrogen into the living world is difficult Plants and phytoplankton are not equipped to incorporate
nitrogen from the atmosphere which exists as tightly bonded triple covalent N2 even though this molecule
comprises approximately 78 percent of the atmosphere Nitrogen enters the living world via freeliving and
symbiotic bacteria which incorporate nitrogen into their macromolecules through nitrogen fixation conversion of
N2 Cyanobacteria live in most aquatic ecosystems where sunlight is present they play a key role in nitrogen
fixation Cyanobacteria are able to use inorganic sources of nitrogen to fix nitrogen Rhizobium bacteria live
symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes such as peas beans and peanuts and provide them with the
organic nitrogen they need For example gardeners often grow peas both for their produce and to naturally
add nitrogen to the soil This practice goes back to ancient times even if the science has only been recently
