catch
It did The rope went taut and Fili pulled in vain Kili came to his help and
then Oin and Gloin They tugged and tugged and suddenly they all fell over on
their backs Bilbo was on the look out however caught the rope and with a
piece of stick fended off the little black boat as it came rushing across the
stream Help he shouted and Balin was just in time to seize the boat before it
floated off down the current
It was tied after all said he looking at the snapped painter that was still
dangling from it That was a good pull my lads and a good job that our rope
was the stronger
Wholl cross first asked Bilbo
I shall said Thorin and you will come with me and Fili and Balin Thats
as many as the boat will hold at a time After that Kili and Oin and Gloin and
Dori next Ori and Nori Bifur and Bofur and last Dwalin and Bombur
Im always last and I dont like it said Bombur Its somebody elses turn
today
You should not be so fat As you are you must be with the last and lightest
boatload Dont start grumbling against orders or something bad will happen to
you
There arent any oars How are you going to push the boat back to the far
bank asked the hobbit
Give me another length of rope and another hook said Fili and when they
had got it ready he cast it into the darkness ahead and as high as he could throw
it Since it did not fall down again they saw that it must have stuck in the
branches Get in now said Fili and one of you haul on the rope that is stuck
in a tree on the other side One of the others must keep hold of the hook we used
at first and when we are safe on the other side he can hook it on and you can
draw the boat back
In this way they were all soon on the far bank safe across the enchanted
stream Dwalin had just scrambled out with the coiled rope on his arm and
Bombur still grumbling was getting ready to follow when something bad did
happen There was a flying sound of hooves on the path ahead Out of the gloom
came suddenly the shape of a flying deer It charged into the dwarves and
bowled them over then gathered itself for a leap High it sprang and cleared the
water with a mighty jump But it did not reach the other side in safety Thorin
was the only one who had kept his feet and his wits As soon as they had landed
he had bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat
