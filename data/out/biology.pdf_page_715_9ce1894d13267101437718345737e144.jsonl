heterosporous The male spores are called microspores because of their smaller size and develop into the
male gametophyte the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte A few seedless
vascular plants and all seed plants are heterosporous and the sporophyte is the dominant generation
The spores of seedless plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as
sporopollenin As the name suggests it is also found in the walls of pollen grains This complex substance is
characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids hence the yellow color
of most pollen Sporopollenin is unusually resistant to chemical and biological degradation In seed plants in
which pollen is the male gametophyte the toughness of sporopollenin explains the existence of wellpreserved
pollen fossils Sporopollenin was once thought to be an innovation of land plants however the charophyte
Coleochaetes also forms spores that contain sporopollenin
Gametangia in Seedless Plants
Gametangia singular gametangium are structures observed on multicellular haploid gametophytes In the
gametangia precursor cells give rise to gametes by mitosis The male gametangium  antheridium releases
sperm Seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment
to the archegonium the female gametangium The embryo develops inside the archegonium as the
sporophyte Gametangia are prominent in seedless plants but are absent or rudimentary in seed plants
Apical Meristems
Shoots and roots of plants increase in length through rapid cell division in a tissue called the apical meristem
which is a small mitotically active zone of cells found at the shoot tip or root tip Figure 254 The apical
meristem is made of undifferentiated cells that continue to proliferate throughout the life of the plant
Meristematic cells give rise to all the specialized tissues of the organism Elongation of the shoots and roots
allows a plant to access additional space and resources light in the case of the shoot and water and minerals
in the case of roots A separate meristem called the lateral meristem produces cells that increase the diameter
of tree trunks
Figure 254 Apical meristem at a root tip Addition of new cells in a root occurs at the apical meristem Subsequent
enlargement of these cells causes the organ to grow and elongate The root cap protects the fragile apical meristem
as the root tip is pushed through the soil by cell elongation
Additional Land Plant Adaptations
As plants adapted to dry land and became independent from the constant presence of water in damp habitats
new organs and structures made their appearance Early land plants did not grow more than a few inches off
the ground competing for light on these low mats By developing a shoot and growing taller individual plants
captured more light Because air offers substantially less support than water land plants incorporated more rigid
molecules in their stems and later tree trunks In small plants such as singlecelled algae simple diffusion
suffices to distribute water and nutrients throughout the organism However for plants to evolve larger forms
the evolution of a conductive tissue for the distribution of water and solutes was a prerequisite The evolution of
vascular tissue in plants met both of these needs The vascular system contains two types of conductive tissue
xylem and phloem Xylem conducts water and minerals absorbed from the soil up to the shoot while phloem
transports food derived from photosynthesis throughout the entire plant In xylem the cells walls are reinforced
with lignin whose tough hydrophobic polymers help prevent the seepage of water across the xylem cell walls
