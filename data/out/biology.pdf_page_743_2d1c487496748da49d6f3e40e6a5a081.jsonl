because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues however they still reproduced
like ferns releasing spores into the environment At least some species were heterosporous Progymnosperms
like the extinct Archaeopteris not to be confused with the ancient bird Archaeopteryx dominated the forests
of the late Devonian period However by the early Triassic c 240 MYA and middle Jurassic c 205 MYA
Mesozoic era the landscape was dominated by the true gymnosperms Angiosperms surpassed gymnosperms
by the middle of the Cretaceous c 100 MYA in the late Mesozoic era and today are the most abundant and
biologically diverse plant group in most terrestrial biomes

Evolution of Gymnosperms
The fossil plant Elkinsia polymorpha a seed fern from the Devonian periodabout 400 million years agois
considered the earliest seed plant known to date Seed ferns Figure 263 produced their seeds along their
branches in structures called cupules that enclosed and protected the ovulethe female gametophyte and
associated tissueswhich develops into a seed upon fertilization Seed plants resembling modern tree ferns
became more numerous and diverse in the coal swamps of the Carboniferous period

Fossil records indicate the first gymnosperms progymnosperms most likely originated in the Paleozoic era
during the middle Devonian period about 390 million years ago The previous Mississippian and Pennsylvanian
periods were wet and dominated by giant fern trees But the following Permian period was dry which gave
a reproductive edge to seed plants which are better adapted to survive dry spells The Ginkgoales a group
