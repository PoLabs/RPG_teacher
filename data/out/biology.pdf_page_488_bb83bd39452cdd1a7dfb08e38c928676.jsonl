The person then mixes all of the pieces together and asks you to reconstruct the photograph In one of the
smaller pieces you see a mountain In a larger piece you see that the same mountain is behind a lake A third
fragment shows only the lake but it reveals that there is a cabin on the shore of the lake Therefore from looking
at the overlapping information in these three fragments you know that the picture contains a mountain behind
a lake that has a cabin on its shore This is the principle behind reconstructing entire DNA sequences using
shotgun sequencing
Originally shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps This was sufficient for
sequencing small genomes However the desire to sequence larger genomes such as that of a human led
to developing doublebarrel shotgun sequencing or pairwiseend sequencing In pairwiseend sequencing
scientists analyze each fragments end for overlap Pairwiseend sequencing is therefore more cumbersome
than shotgun sequencing but it is easier to reconstruct the sequence because there is more available
information
Nextgeneration Sequencing
Since 2005 automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of nextgeneration
sequencing which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing These automated low
cost sequencers can generate sequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments 25 to 500
base pairs in the span of one day These sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome
process of putting all the fragments in order
Comparing Sequences
A sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins DNA or RNA Scientists use it to identify similar
regions between cell types or species which may indicate function or structure conservation We can use
sequence alignments to construct phylogenetic trees The following website uses a software program called
BLAST basic local alignment search tool httpblastncbinlmnihgovBlastcgi 
Under Basic Blast click Nucleotide Blast Input the following sequence into the large query sequence
box ATTGCTTCGATTGCA Below the box locate the Species field and type human or Homo sapiens
Then click BLAST to compare the inputted sequence against the human genomes known sequences
The result is that this sequence occurs in over a hundred places in the human genome Scroll down below
the graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see a short description of each of the matching hits Pick
one of the hits near the top of the list and click on Graphics This will bring you to a page that shows the
sequences location within the entire human genome You can move the slider that looks like a green flag
back and forth to view the sequences immediately around the selected gene You can then return to your
selected sequence by clicking the ATG button
Use of WholeGenome Sequences of Model Organisms
British biochemist and Nobel Prize winner Fred Sanger used a bacterial virus the bacteriophage fx174 5368
base pairs to completely sequence the first genome Other scientists later sequenced several other organelle
and viral genomes American biotechnologist biochemist geneticist and businessman Craig Venter sequenced
the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae in the 1980s Approximately 74 different laboratories collaborated on
sequencing the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which began in 1989 and was completed in
1996 because it was 60 times bigger than any other genome sequencing By 1997 the genome sequences
of two important model organisms were available the bacterium Escherichia coli K12 and the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae We now know the genomes of other model organisms such as the mouse Mus
musculus the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and humans Homo
sapiens Researchers perform extensive basic research in model organisms because they can apply the
information to genetically similar organisms A model organism is a species that researchers use as a model
to understand the biological processes in other species that the model organism represents Having entire
genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms The process of attaching
biological information to gene sequences is genome annotation Annotating gene sequences helps with basic
experiments in molecular biology such as designing PCR primers and RNA targets
