63 CENTRES AND PERIPHERIES

and chaos They were crowded with people from all over the empire who 
flocked to the booming cities searching for work and modest prosperity The 
newcomers carried along with their few belongings the cultural values of the 
peripheries to the centres a single train journey to the city was not enough 
to transform them into enlightened citizens In their new role as workers 
people from the inner and outer peripheries would soon play a major role in 
the revolutionary chaos that was about to unfold in the empire The railway had 
helped many of them come into position and it was no coincidence that some 
of the most important episodes of the Russian Civil War were fought along 
the railway lines No longer did rail simply connect centres and peripheries it 
now represented the very arteries of political power in a disintegrating empire
The third case is quite different In its heyday the Ottoman Empire was 
the centre of its own world and all that lay beyond its frontiers was in a 
sense periphery in the eyes of its ruling elites As for the Ottoman domains 
themselves it is tricky to apply the notions of centre and periphery to an empire 
that was like many patrimonial empires of that time based on diversity This 
was not only in terms of language ethnicity and religion but also in terms of 
law regulation and the management of different territories The nineteenth 
century with its statebuilding process its notion of equality before the law 
and its standardisation of government intervention necessarily meant an 
important change for the Ottomans Until the early years of the twentieth 
century the imperial elites considered their domains in the Balkans together 
with western and central Anatolia as the core lands of the empire In fact 
many of them were born and raised in these regions A nineteenthcentury 
gentleman from Istanbul understood Libya or Iraq as imperial peripheries
but not the Balkan regions even if they had acquired a high level of autonomy 
Wallachia for example but not Thessaloniki or Skopje In fact some historians 
have understood the intervention of the Ottoman government in some of 
the Arab territories including the investment in infrastructures as internal 
colonisation legitimised as a sort of civilising mission Such selffashioning as 
the moderniser of backward regions can be understood partly as a response 
to European stereotypes of the Ottoman government as inefficient and a 
hindrance to the progress of its subjects In some cases Ottoman investment 
in infrastructures in remote territories had a clear political message the Hejaz 
Railway built and funded by the Ottoman government was to take pilgrims 
safely and efficiently to Medina while emphasising the sultans role as 
protector of the Holy Shrines and the leader of the Muslim world 
In the Balkans the interplay of forces around infrastructure was extremely 
complex particularly in the case of railways The actors involved had 
different often clashing interests The Ottoman authorities were willing 
to fund infrastructures to boost the economy particularly promoting the
