of previous centuries In his Lectures on the Philosophy of World History given 
between 1822 and 1830 the German philosopher Friedrich Hegel 17701831 
wrote that Africa in itself holds no particular historical interest except for 
the fact that men live there in barbarism and savagery devoid of civilisation 
 it is a childlike country enveloped in the darkness of night This was a 
fairly representative view for the nineteenth century In the twentieth century 
similar views are still present in the European imagination For example as 
recently as 5 July 1998 the Spanish newspaper ABC argued that African 
decolonisation was premature and the forms of nationalism created were 
something akin to placing a loaded bomb in the hands of a child  Mentoring 
is required for these childminded people and their leaders
The dissolution of European empires over the course of the twentieth 
century evidently changed Europes relationship towards the African 
continent The process of political decolonisation represented a new stage in 
their relations although there were still attempts by European colonisers to 
maintain control by modifying certain rules in the colonial system The colonial 
powers according to Frederick Cooper also sought to domesticate the new 
social forces unleashed by decolonisation through more friendly policies of 
development and stabilisation Thus these new political ties did not imply a 
profound change in the perception of Africa from the European perspective 
as the examples below show
There are at least three central imaginary constructions in relation to Africa 
that have persisted until today The first is the Africa of Misery focusing on 
extreme poverty and instability as well as famine sexual violence and a lack 
of basic sanitation on the continent This image goes beyond an economic 
perspective and enters the sphere of morality Africans do not have things 
they are underdeveloped because they supposedly lack the capacity 
to manage their own wealth whether as a result of geography climate or 
social and historical issues As such they are often visually represented as 
nude suffering from the ravages of hunger and inhabiting stark inhospitable 
environments This miserable Africa is the chosen land of intervention
military interventions as well as charitable ones by nongovernmental and 
humanitarian organisations This imaginary underpinned European imperial 
and colonial ambitions for several centuries and persisted in the twentieth 
century An example is the dictatorship of Antonio Salazar 18891970 in 
Portugal which sought to reinforce through military power the role of Europe 
in the civilising process Various history books such as Carlos Selvagems 
Portugal Militar 1926 or Historia do Exercito Portugues 1945 by Luis Augusto 
Ferreira Martins supported this idea by glorifying past military actions in 
the colonial wars Another contemporary example of this image of African 
people as underdeveloped is the Spanish chocolate brand Conguitos which
