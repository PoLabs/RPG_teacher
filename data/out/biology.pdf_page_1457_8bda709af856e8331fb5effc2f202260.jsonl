Simple Learned Behaviors
The majority of the behaviors previously discussed were innate or at least have an innate component variations
on the innate behaviors may be learned They are inherited and the behaviors do not change in response
to signals from the environment Conversely learned behaviors even though they may have instinctive
components allow an organism to adapt to changes in the environment and are modified by previous
experiences Simple learned behaviors include habituation and imprintingboth are important to the maturation
process of young animals
Habituation
Habituation is a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period
of repeated exposure This is a form of nonassociative learning as the stimulus is not associated with any
punishment or reward Prairie dogs typically sound an alarm call when threatened by a predator but they
become habituated to the sound of human footsteps when no harm is associated with this sound therefore they
no longer respond to them with an alarm call In this example habituation is specific to the sound of human
footsteps as the animals still respond to the sounds of potential predators
Imprinting
Imprinting is a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the
species involved Hatchling ducks recognize the first adult they see their mother and make a bond with her A
familiar sight is ducklings walking or swimming after their mothers Figure 4539 This is another type of non
associative learning but is very important in the maturation process of these animals as it encourages them to
stay near their mother so they will be protected greatly increasing their chances of survival However if newborn
ducks see a human before they see their mother they will imprint on the human and follow it in just the same
manner as they would follow their real mother
Figure 4539 The attachment of ducklings to their mother is an example of imprinting credit modification of work by
