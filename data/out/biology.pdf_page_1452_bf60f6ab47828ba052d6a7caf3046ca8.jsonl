Kinesis and Taxis
Another activity or movement of innate behavior is kinesis or the undirected movement in response to a
stimulus Orthokinesis is the increased or decreased speed of movement of an organism in response to a
stimulus Woodlice for example increase their speed of movement when exposed to high or low temperatures
This movement although random increases the probability that the insect spends less time in the unfavorable
environment Another example is klinokinesis an increase in turning behaviors It is exhibited by bacteria
such as E coli which in association with orthokinesis helps the organisms randomly find a more hospitable
environment
A similar but more directed version of kinesis is taxis the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus
This movement can be in response to light phototaxis chemical signals chemotaxis or gravity geotaxis
and can be directed toward positive or away negative from the source of the stimulus An example of a
positive chemotaxis is exhibited by the unicellular protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila This organism swims
using its cilia at times moving in a straight line and at other times making turns The attracting chemotactic
agent alters the frequency of turning as the organism moves directly toward the source following the increasing
concentration gradient
Fixed Action Patterns
A fixed action pattern is a series of movements elicited by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus
is removed the pattern goes on to completion An example of such a behavior occurs in the threespined
stickleback a small freshwater fish Figure 4534 Males of this species develop a red belly during breeding
season and show instinctual aggressiveness to other males during this time In laboratory experiments
researchers exposed such fish to objects that in no way resemble a fish in their shape but which were painted
red on their lower halves The male sticklebacks responded aggressively to the objects just as if they were real
male sticklebacks
Figure 4534 Male threespined stickleback fish exhibit a fixed action pattern During mating season the males which
develop a bright red belly react strongly to redbottomed objects that in no way resemble fish
Migration
Migration is the longrange seasonal movement of animals It is an evolved adapted response to variation in
resource availability and it is a common phenomenon found in all major groups of animals Birds fly south for
the winter to get to warmer climates with sufficient food and salmon migrate to their spawning grounds The
popular 2005 documentary March of the Penguins followed the 62mile migration of emperor penguins through
Antarctica to bring food back to their breeding site and to their young Wildebeests Figure 4535 migrate over
1800 miles each year in search of new grasslands
