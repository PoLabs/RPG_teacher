after actuarial tables used by the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy Life tables may
include the probability of individuals dying before their next birthday ie their mortality rate the percentage
of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval and their life expectancy at each interval An example
of a life table is shown in Table 451 from a study of Dall mountain sheep a species native to northwestern
North America Notice that the population is divided into age intervals column A The mortality rate per 1000
shown in column D is based on the number of individuals dying during the age interval column B divided by
the number of individuals surviving at the beginning of the interval Column C multiplied by 1000
mortality rate  number of individuals dying
number of individuals surviving x 1000
For example between ages three and four 12 individuals die out of the 776 that were remaining from the original
1000 sheep This number is then multiplied by 1000 to get the mortality rate per thousand
mortality rate  12
776 x 1000  155
As can be seen from the mortality rate data column D a high death rate occurred when the sheep were
between 6 and 12 months old and then increased even more from 8 to 12 years old after which there were few
survivors The data indicate that if a sheep in this population were to survive to age one it could be expected to
live another 77 years on average as shown by the life expectancy numbers in column E

Survivorship Curves
Another tool used by population ecologists is a survivorship curve which is a graph of the number of
