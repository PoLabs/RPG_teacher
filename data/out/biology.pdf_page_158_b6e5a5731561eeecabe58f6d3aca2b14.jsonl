Peripheral proteins are on the membranes exterior and interior surfaces attached either to integral proteins
or to phospholipids Peripheral proteins along with integral proteins may serve as enzymes as structural
attachments for the cytoskeletons fibers or as part of the cells recognition sites Scientists sometimes refer to
these as cellspecific proteins The body recognizes its own proteins and attacks foreign proteins associated
with invasive pathogens
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are the third major plasma membrane component They are always on the cells exterior surface
and are bound either to proteins forming glycoproteins or to lipids forming glycolipids Figure 52 These
carbohydrate chains may consist of 260 monosaccharide units and can be either straight or branched Along
with peripheral proteins carbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize
each other These sites have unique patterns that allow for cell recognition much the way that the facial features
unique to each person allow individuals to recognize him or her This recognition function is very important to
cells as it allows the immune system to differentiate between body cells self and foreign cells or tissues
nonself Similar glycoprotein and glycolipid types are on the surfaces of viruses and may change frequently
preventing immune cells from recognizing and attacking them
We collectively refer to these carbohydrates on the cells exterior surfacethe carbohydrate components of both
glycoproteins and glycolipidsas the glycocalyx meaning sugar coating The glycocalyx is highly hydrophilic
and attracts large amounts of water to the cells surface This aids in the cells interaction with its watery
environment and in the cells ability to obtain substances dissolved in the water As we discussed above the
glycocalyx is also important for cell identification selfnonself determination and embryonic development and
is used in cell to cell attachments to form tissues
