Introduction
In Jules Vernes novel Around the World in 80 Days 1872 the protagonist 
Phileas Fogg discovers in the Morning Chronicle of 2 October 1872 that it is 
now possible to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days from east to west 
on a route that alternates between railways and steamships In its own way 
Vernes novel recounted the odyssey of the contemporary world which his 
hero obviously British and a maniac of time would not have been able to 
achieve without the immeasurable progress made in land and sea transport 
Similarly new means of transatlantic communication had extended land
based telegraph networks 
The long nineteenth century Eric Hobsbawm was the century of the steam 
engine Due to its amazing power the exchange of people goods and ideas 
reached new dimensions Installed in locomotives the mobile steam engine 
became the driving force of an everfaster journey to modernity Railways 
were regarded as symbols of progress transporting products and so it was 
thought values to the remotest peripheries and regions Most importantly 
railroads were able to transcend the obstacles of space distance and time 
Taken together they seemed to be a solution to one of the crucial questions of 
European history beginning from the midnineteenth century the integration 
of internal and external peripheries and their connection to economic and 
political centres This chapter uses railroads and their infrastructures as a lens 
to discuss this decisive and ambivalent process that has shaped European 
history to this very day 
Empirical evidence used in this chapter stems largely from three major 
empires that were themselves located at the European peripheries Theythe
