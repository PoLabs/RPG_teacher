of the root The endodermis is exclusive to roots and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the roots
vascular system A waxy substance called suberin is present on the walls of the endodermal cells This waxy
region known as the Casparian strip forces water and solutes to cross the plasma membranes of endodermal
cells instead of slipping between the cells This ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the
endodermis while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded The outermost cell layer of the roots
vascular tissue is the pericycle an area that can give rise to lateral roots In dicot roots the xylem and phloem
of the stele are arranged alternately in an X shape whereas in monocot roots the vascular tissue is arranged in
a ring around the pith
Figure 3018 In left typical dicots the vascular tissue forms an X shape in the center of the root In right typical
monocots the phloem cells and the larger xylem cells form a characteristic ring around the central pith
Root Modifications
Root structures may be modified for specific purposes For example some roots are bulbous and store starch
Aerial roots and prop roots are two forms of aboveground roots that provide additional support to anchor the
plant Tap roots such as carrots turnips and beets are examples of roots that are modified for food storage

Figure 3019 Many vegetables are modified roots
Epiphytic roots enable a plant to grow on another plant For example the epiphytic roots of orchids develop
a spongy tissue to absorb moisture The banyan tree Ficus sp begins as an epiphyte germinating in the
branches of a host tree aerial roots develop from the branches and eventually reach the ground providing
additional support Figure 3020 In screwpine Pandanus sp a palmlike tree that grows in sandy tropical
soils aboveground prop roots develop from the nodes to provide additional support
