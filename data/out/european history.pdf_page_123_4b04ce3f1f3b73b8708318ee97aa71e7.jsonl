conceptions of the Ottoman Empire were increasingly replaced by mockery 
and contempt especially as the balance of military success began to shift in 
favour of the Austrian Habsburgs especially with the failed Ottoman siege 
of Vienna of 1683 and the OttomanRussian conflicts in the second half of the 
eighteenth century For many Enlightenment thinkers such as the French 
political philosopher Montesquieu 16891755 the Ottoman sultans became 
the embodiment of oriental despotism On the other hand the eighteenth 
century also witnessed an explosion of Turcophilia in arts music theatre and 
fashion Therefore the only consistent feature of European attitudes towards 
the Ottomans was arguably their ambivalence 
In contrast early modern Europeans produced particularly positive accounts 
of the Chinese civilisation including its technical development waterways 
means of transport technological innovations print paper gunpowder a 
developed urban culture written culture and a strong literary tradition social 
hierarchisation luxury and refinementall existing under a stable and highly 
centralised imperial structure Chinese religious ideas were usually contested 
and criticised however This generally positive image disappeared rather 
quickly during the nineteenth century
Europes perception of Safavid Persia went through similar changes In the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries while commercial contacts expanded 
ruins of ancient and biblical origins located in Persia were described by 
European travellers and missionaries with some enthusiasm Positive attitudes 
towards the Safavids were built to no small extent on common enmity with the 
Ottomans These two Middle Eastern powers had been locked in an imperial 
rivalry since the emergence of the Safavid dynasty in the early sixteenth century 
Much like the conflict between Europe and the Ottoman Empire the Ottoman
Safavid conflict had a strong religious dimension as the Ottomans fashioned a 
distinctly Sunni Muslim identity for themselves while the Safavids embraced 
Shiism As recent research has shown this religious rift within the Muslim 
community which goes back to the first century of Islam and continues to 
influence modern geopolitics was significantly amplified and institutionalised 
by the OttomanSafavid conflict European observers were well aware of this 
distinction if not necessarily its exact foundations When the Safavid dynasty 
began to crumble in the eighteenth century however Europeans increasingly 
characterised it as decadent linking their account to earlier descriptions of the 
ancient ruins that European travellers had encountered in Iran
While wealth splendour and sophistication of court environments like 
those of the Ottomans Safavids and Mughals won the praise and admiration 
of Europeans positive attitudes towards the first indigenous populations 
encountered on the shores of the American continent focused instead on 
paradisiac images of beautiful and innocent humans such instances are found
