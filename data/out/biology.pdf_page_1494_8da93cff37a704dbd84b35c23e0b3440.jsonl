KEY TERMS
corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas turning it into weak
sulfuric acid can damage structures and ecosystems
ecosystem model that is created with mathematical formulas to predict the effects of
environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics
organism at the top of the food chain
biomass consumed and assimilated from the previous trophic level after accounting for the energy
lost due to incomplete ingestion of food energy used for respiration and energy lost as waste
cycling of mineral nutrients through ecosystems and through the nonliving world
increasing concentrations of persistent toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level
from the primary producers to the apex consumers
total weight at the time of measurement of living or previously living organisms in a unit area within a
trophic level
organism capable of synthesizing its own food using energy from inorganic molecules
also compartment model ecosystem model that consists of flow charts that show the
interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the ecosystem
area within an ecosystem in lakes and near the mouths of rivers where large areas of ecosystems
are depleted of their normal flora and fauna these zones can be caused by eutrophication oil spills
dumping of toxic chemicals and other human activities
type of food web in which the primary consumers consist of decomposers these are often
associated with grazing food webs within the same ecosystem
also Eltonian pyramid graphical representation of different trophic levels in an ecosystem
based of organism numbers biomass or energy content
community of living organisms and their interactions with their abiotic environment
study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment or
internal forces
steady state of an ecosystem where all organisms are in balance with their environment and each
other
process whereby nutrient runoff causes the excess growth of microorganisms depleting
dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna
direct deposit of solid minerals on land or in the ocean from the atmosphere
linear representation of a chain of primary producers primary consumers and higherlevel
consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics
graphic representation of a holistic nonlinear web of primary producers primary consumers and
higherlevel consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics
type of food web in which the primary producers are either plants on land or phytoplankton in
the water often associated with a detrital food web within the same ecosystem
rate at which photosynthetic primary producers incorporate energy from the sun
study that attempts to quantify the composition interactions and dynamics of entire
ecosystems often limited by economic and logistical difficulties depending on the ecosystem
