The Plasma Membrane of Prokaryotes
The prokaryotic plasma membrane is a thin lipid bilayer 6 to 8 nanometers that completely surrounds the
cell and separates the inside from the outside Its selectively permeable nature keeps ions proteins and
other molecules within the cell and prevents them from diffusing into the extracellular environment while
other molecules may move through the membrane Recall that the general structure of a cell membrane is a
phospholipid bilayer composed of two layers of lipid molecules In archaeal cell membranes isoprene phytanyl
chains linked to glycerol replace the fatty acids linked to glycerol in bacterial membranes Some archaeal
membranes are lipid monolayers instead of bilayers Figure 2215
