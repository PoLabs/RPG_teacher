Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry
I couldnt help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying 
Bet you could Ron muttered
and you mustnt go wandering around the school at night think of the
points youll lose Gryffindor if youre caught and youre bound to be
Its really very selfish of you
And its really none of your business said Harry
Goodbye said Ron
All the same it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the day
Harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus
falling asleep Neville wasnt back from the hospital wing Ron had
spent all evening giving him advice such as If he tries to curse you
youd better dodge it because I cant remember how to block them
There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or
Mrs Norris and Harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another
school rule today On the other hand Malfoys sneering face kept looming
up out of the darkness  this was his big chance to beat Malfoy
facetoface He couldnt miss it
Halfpast eleven Ron muttered at last wed better go
They pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across
the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the Gryffindor
common room A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning
all the armchairs into hunched black shadows They had almost reached
the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them I
cant believe youre going to do this Harry
A lamp flickered on It was Hermione Granger wearing a pink bathrobe
and a frown
You said Ron furiously Go back to bed
I almost told your brother Hermione snapped Percy  hes a
prefect hed put a stop to this
Harry couldnt believe anyone could be so interfering
