Figure 198 Different types of natural selection can impact the distribution of phenotypes within a population In
a stabilizing selection an average phenotype is favored In b directional selection a change in the environment
shifts the spectrum of observed phenotypes In c diversifying selection two or more extreme phenotypes are
selected for while the average phenotype is selected against
In recent years factories have become cleaner and release less soot into the environment What impact do
you think this has had on the distribution of moth color in the population
FrequencyDependent Selection
Another type of selection frequencydependent selection favors phenotypes that are either common positive
frequencydependent selection or rare negative frequencydependent selection We can observe an
interesting example of this type of selection in a unique group of Pacific Northwest lizards Male common side
blotched lizards come in three throatcolor patterns orange blue and yellow Each of these forms has a different
reproductive strategy orange males are the strongest and can fight other males for access to their females
Blue males are mediumsized and form strong pair bonds with their mates Yellow males Figure 199 are
the smallest and look a bit like females which allows them to sneak copulations Like a game of rockpaper
scissors orange beats blue blue beats yellow and yellow beats orange in the competition for females That is
the big strong orange males can fight off the blue males to mate with the blues pairbonded females the blue
males are successful at guarding their mates against yellow sneaker males and the yellow males can sneak
copulations from the potential mates of the large polygynous orange males
