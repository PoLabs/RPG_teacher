never ever forget tonight
Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come but
come they did To their great surprise both he and Ron passed with good
marks Hermione of course had the best grades of the first years Even
Neville scraped through his good Herbology mark making up for his
abysmal Potions one They had hoped that Goyle who was almost as stupid
as he was mean might be thrown out but he had passed too It was a
shame but as Ron said you couldnt have everything in life
And suddenly their wardrobes were empty their trunks were packed
Nevilles toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets notes were
handed out to all students warning them not to use magic over the
holidays I always hope theyll forget to give us these said Fred
Weasley sadly Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats
that sailed across the lake they were boarding the Hogwarts Express
talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier
eating Bettie Botts Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns
pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats pulling
into platform nine and threequarters at Kings Cross Station
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform A wizened
old guard was up by the ticket barrier letting them go through the gate
in twos and threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out
of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles
You must come and stay this summer said Ron both of you  Ill
send you an owl
Thanks said Harry Ill need something to look forward to People
jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle
world Some of them called
Bye Harry
See you Potter
Still famous said Ron grinning at him
Not where Im going I promise you said Harry
He Ron and Hermione passed through the gateway together There he is
Mom there he is look
