measuring forestarea loss and understanding speciesarea relationships The speciesarea relationship is
the rate at which new species are seen when the area surveyed is increased Studies have shown that the
number of species present increases as the size of the island increases This phenomenon has also been
shown to hold true in other islandlike habitats as well such as the mountaintop tepuis of Venezuela which
are surrounded by tropical forest Turning this relationship around if the habitat area is reduced the number
of species living there will also decline Estimates of extinction rates based on habitat loss and speciesarea
relationships have suggested that with about 90 percent habitat loss an expected 50 percent of species would
become extinct Speciesarea estimates have led to species extinction rate calculations of about 1000 EMSY
and higher In general actual observations do not show this amount of loss and suggestions have been made
that there is a delay in extinction Recent work has also called into question the applicability of the speciesarea
relationship when estimating the loss of species This work argues that the speciesarea relationship leads to an
overestimate of extinction rates A better relationship to use may be the endemicsarea relationship Using this
method would bring estimates down to around 500 EMSY in the coming century Note that this value is still 500
times the background rate

472  The Importance of Biodiversity to Human Life
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify chemical diversity benefits to humans

Identify biodiversity components that support human agriculture

Describe ecosystem services
It may not be clear why biologists are concerned about biodiversity loss When biodiversity loss is thought of
as the extinction of the passenger pigeon the dodo bird and even the woolly mammoth the loss may appear
to be an emotional one But is the loss practically important for the welfare of the human species From the
perspective of evolution and ecology the loss of a particular individual species is unimportant however we
