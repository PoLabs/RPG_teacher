Obesity
Obesity is a major health concern in the United States and there is a growing focus on reducing obesity and
the diseases it may lead to such as type2 diabetes cancers of the colon and breast and cardiovascular
disease How does the food consumed contribute to obesity
Fatty foods are caloriedense meaning that they have more calories per unit mass than carbohydrates or
proteins One gram of carbohydrates has four calories one gram of protein has four calories and one gram
of fat has nine calories Animals tend to seek lipidrich food for their higher energy content
The signals of hunger time to eat and satiety time to stop eating are controlled in the hypothalamus
region of the brain Foods that are rich in fatty acids tend to promote satiety more than foods that are rich
only in carbohydrates
Excess carbohydrate and ATP are used by the liver to synthesize glycogen The pyruvate produced during
glycolysis is used to synthesize fatty acids When there is more glucose in the body than required the
resulting excess pyruvate is converted into molecules that eventually result in the synthesis of fatty acids
within the body These fatty acids are stored in adipose cellsthe fat cells in the mammalian body whose
primary role is to store fat for later use
It is important to note that some animals benefit from obesity Polar bears and seals need body fat for
insulation and to keep them from losing body heat during Arctic winters When food is scarce stored body
fat provides energy for maintaining homeostasis Fats prevent famine in mammals allowing them to access
energy when food is not available on a daily basis fats are stored when a large kill is made or lots of food
is available
343  Digestive System Processes
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the process of digestion

Detail the steps involved in digestion and absorption

Define elimination

Explain the role of both the small and large intestines in absorption
Obtaining nutrition and energy from food is a multistep process For true animals the first step is ingestion the
act of taking in food This is followed by digestion absorption and elimination In the following sections each of
these steps will be discussed in detail
Ingestion
The large molecules found in intact food cannot pass through the cell membranes Food needs to be broken into
smaller particles so that animals can harness the nutrients and organic molecules The first step in this process
is ingestion Ingestion is the process of taking in food through the mouth In vertebrates the teeth saliva and
tongue play important roles in mastication preparing the food into bolus While the food is being mechanically
broken down the enzymes in saliva begin to chemically process the food as well The combined action of these
processes modifies the food from large particles to a soft mass that can be swallowed and can travel the length
of the esophagus
Digestion and Absorption
Digestion is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into small organic fragments It is important to
breakdown macromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive
epithelium Large complex molecules of proteins polysaccharides and lipids must be reduced to simpler
particles such as simple sugar before they can be absorbed by the digestive epithelial cells Different organs play
