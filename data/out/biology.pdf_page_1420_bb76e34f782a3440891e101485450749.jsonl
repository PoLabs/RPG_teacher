For mobile organisms such as mammals birds or fish scientists use a technique called mark and recapture
This method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way such as tags bands paint or other
body markings and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the
population Later researchers collect a new sample including some individuals that are marked recaptures
and some individuals that are unmarked Figure 454

Using the ratio of marked and unmarked individuals scientists determine how many individuals are in the
sample From this calculations are used to estimate the total population size This method assumes that the
larger the population the lower the percentage of tagged organisms that will be recaptured since they will have
mixed with more untagged individuals For example if 80 deer are captured tagged and released into the forest
and later 100 deer are captured and 20 of them are already marked we can estimate the population size N
using the following equation
number marked fir t catch x total number of second catch
number marked second catch
  N
Using our example the population size would be estimated at 400
80 x 100
20
  400
Therefore there are an estimated 400 total individuals in the original population
There are some limitations to the mark and recapture method Some animals from the first catch may learn to
avoid capture in the second round thus inflating population estimates Alternatively some animals may prefer to
be retrapped especially if a food reward is offered resulting in an underestimate of population size Also some
species may be harmed by the marking technique reducing their survival A variety of other techniques have
been developed including the electronic tracking of animals tagged with radio transmitters and the use of data
from commercial fishing and trapping operations to estimate the size and health of populations and communities
