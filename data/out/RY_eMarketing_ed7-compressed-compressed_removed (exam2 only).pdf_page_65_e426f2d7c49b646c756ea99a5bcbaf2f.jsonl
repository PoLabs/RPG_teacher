CREATING
1212 THE BIGGER PICTURE
Video marketing can form the cornerstone of a great content marketing strategy linking closely 
with the other content that you create to engage and provide value to your customers Videos 
can also be added to marketing messages such as email newsletters to improve engagement 
Because search engines serve a range of media types on their results pages video content 
plays an important role in search engine optimisation Not only can optimising videos for 
search increase your search engine ranking but data show that it increases clickthrough rate 
from the search engine results pages these visits are longer and more engaged than other 
search visits and more likely to result in conversions Social media provides a great tool for 
spreading your video and video content can be a strong driver for users to join your social 
media platforms Make sure that you provide users with great value 
1213 SUMMARY 
Video has become an integral part of the online world The potential for exposure as well 
as interaction is massive and brands that fail to capitalise on this risk being left behind as 
competitors build thriving communities 
As with most content it is up to the brand to decide how to represent its video content Videos 
can be hosted on popular videosharing websites to capitalise on already existing audiences 
and developed interfaces or on bespoke websites that allow for free reign in customisation 
Brands should then aim to optimise their videos on the chosen platforms to increase their 
visibility on search engines 
Creating a healthy community is also important in increasing exposure Very rarely if ever 
does an audience come to video content without input from the creators On top of optimising 
for search and other tweaks brands should upload content regularly or risk losing any ground 
gained Social media should be considered as its platforms allow for the sharing of content 
and commentary Overall brands should be aware that there is no quick fix for video It requires 
planning and investment as well as longterm commitment to creating brand advocates
