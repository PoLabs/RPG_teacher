Figure 3316 Adipose is a connective tissue is made up of cells called adipocytes Adipocytes have small nuclei
localized at the cell edge
Blood
Blood is considered a connective tissue because it has a matrix as shown in Figure 3317 The living cell types
are red blood cells RBC also called erythrocytes and white blood cells WBC also called leukocytes The
fluid portion of whole blood its matrix is commonly called plasma
Figure 3317 Blood is a connective tissue that has a fluid matrix called plasma and no fibers Erythrocytes red blood
cells the predominant cell type are involved in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide Also present are various
leukocytes white blood cells involved in immune response
The cell found in greatest abundance in blood is the erythrocyte Erythrocytes are counted in millions in a blood
sample the average number of red blood cells in primates is 47 to 55 million cells per microliter Erythrocytes
are consistently the same size in a species but vary in size between species For example the average diameter
of a primate red blood cell is 75 l a dog is close at 70 l but a cats RBC diameter is 59 l Sheep erythrocytes
are even smaller at 46 l Mammalian erythrocytes lose their nuclei and mitochondria when they are released
from the bone marrow where they are made Fish amphibian and avian red blood cells maintain their nuclei
and mitochondria throughout the cells life The principal job of an erythrocyte is to carry and deliver oxygen to
the tissues
Leukocytes are the predominant white blood cells found in the peripheral blood Leukocytes are counted in the
thousands in the blood with measurements expressed as ranges primate counts range from 4800 to 10800
cells per l dogs from 5600 to 19200 cells per l cats from 8000 to 25000 cells per l cattle from 4000 to
12000 cells per l and pigs from 11000 to 22000 cells per l
Lymphocytes function primarily in the immune response to foreign antigens or material Different types of
lymphocytes make antibodies tailored to the foreign antigens and control the production of those antibodies
Neutrophils are phagocytic cells and they participate in one of the early lines of defense against microbial
