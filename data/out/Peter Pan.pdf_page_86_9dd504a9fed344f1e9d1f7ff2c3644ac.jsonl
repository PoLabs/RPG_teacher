The exultation of the boys the lowering looks of the pirates both
were seen by Hook
Cecco he said in his most steely voice go back and fetch me
out that doodledoo
Cecco bravest of the brave cowered before his captain crying
No no but Hook was purring to his claw
Did you say you would go Cecco he said musingly
Cecco went first flinging his arms despairingly There was no
more singing all listened now and again came a deathscreech and
again a crow
No one spoke except Slightly Three he said
Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture Sdeath and odds fish he
thundered who is to bring me that doodledoo
Wait till Cecco comes out growled Starkey and the others took
up the cry
I think I heard you volunteer Starkey said Hook purring again
No by thunder Starkey cried
My hook thinks you did said Hook crossing to him I wonder
if it would not be advisable Starkey to humour the hook
Ill swing before I go in there replied Starkey doggedly and
again he had the support of the crew
Is this mutiny asked Hook more pleasantly than ever
Starkeys ringleader
Captain mercy Starkey whimpered all of a tremble now
Shake hands Starkey said Hook proffering his claw
Starkey looked round for help but all deserted him As he backed
up Hook advanced and now the red spark was in his eye With a
despairing scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated
himself into the sea
Four said Slightly
And now Hook said courteously did any other gentlemen say
mutiny Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing
gesture Ill bring out that doodledoo myself he said and sped
into the cabin
Five How Slightly longed to say it He wetted his lips to be
ready but Hook came staggering out without his lantern
Something blew out the light he said a little unsteadily
Something echoed Mullins
What of Cecco demanded Noodler
Hes as dead as Jukes said Hook shortly
His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all
unfavourably and the mutinous sounds again broke forth All pirates
are superstitious and Cookson cried They do say the surest sign a
ships accurst is when theres one on board more than can be
accounted for
Ive heard muttered Mullins he always boards the pirate craft
last Had he a tail captain
