itself covered in several feet of snow The lake froze solid and the
Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that
they followed Quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban The
few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to
deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could
fly off again
No one could wait for the holidays to start While the Gryffindor common
room and the Great Hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had
become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms
Worst of all were Professor Snapes classes down in the dungeons where
their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as
possible to their hot cauldrons
I do feel so sorry said Draco Malfoy one Potions class for all
those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because theyre
not wanted at home
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke Crabbe and Goyle chuckled
Harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored them
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch
match Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost he had tried to get
everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing
Harry as Seeker next Then hed realized that nobody found this funny
because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay
on his bucking broomstick So Malfoy jealous and angry had gone back
to taunting Harry about having no proper family
It was true that Harry wasnt going back to Privet Drive for Christmas
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before making a list of
students who would be staying for the holidays and Harry had signed up
at once He didnt feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be
the best Christmas hed ever had Ron and his brothers were staying
too because Mr and Mrs Weasley were going to Romania to visit
Charlie
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions they found a large
fir tree blocking the corridor ahead Two enormous feet sticking out at
the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it
Hi Hagrid want any help Ron asked sticking his head through the
branches
