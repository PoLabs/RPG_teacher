Figure 2815 Traditional flatworm classes Phylum Platyhelminthes was previously divided into four classes a Class
Turbellaria includes the freeliving polycladid Bedfords flatworm Pseudobiceros bedfordi which is about 8 to 10 cm
in length b The parasitic class Monogenea includes Dactylogyrus spp commonly called gill flukes which are about
02 mm in length and have two anchors indicated by arrows used to attach the parasite on to the gills of host fish c
The class Trematoda includes Fascioloides magna right and Fasciola hepatica two specimens on left also known
as the common liver fluke d Class Cestoda includes tapeworms such as this Taenia saginata infects both cattle
and humans and can reach 4 to 10 meters in length the specimen shown here is about four meters long credit a

Most freeliving flatworms are marine polycladids although tricladid species live in freshwater or moist terrestrial
environments and there are a number of members from other orders in both environments The ventral
epidermis of freeliving flatworms is ciliated which facilitates their locomotion Some freeliving flatworms are
capable of remarkable feats of regeneration in which an individual may regrow its head or tail after being
severed or even several heads if the planaria is cut lengthwise
The monogeneans are ectoparasites mostly of fish with simple life cycles that consist of a freeswimming larva
that attaches to a fish prior to its transformation to the ectoparasitic adult form The parasite has only one host
and that host is usually very specific The worms may produce enzymes that digest the host tissues or they
may simply graze on surface mucus and skin particles Most monogeneans are hermaphroditic but the male
gametes develop first and so crossfertilization is quite common
The trematodes or flukes are internal parasites of mollusks and many other groups including humans
Trematodes have complex life cycles that involve a primary host in which sexual reproduction occurs and one
or more secondary hosts in which asexual reproduction occurs The primary host is usually a vertebrate and
the secondary host is almost always a mollusk in which multiple larvae are produced asexually Trematodes
which attached internally to the host via an oral and medial sucker are responsible for serious human diseases
including schistosomiasis caused by several species of the blood fluke Schistosoma spp Various forms of
schistosomiasis infect an estimated 200 million people in the tropics leading to organ damage secondary
infection by bacteria and chronic symptoms like fatigue Infection occurs when the human enters the water and
