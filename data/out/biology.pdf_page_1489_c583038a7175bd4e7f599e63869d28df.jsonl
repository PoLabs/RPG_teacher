freshwater eutrophication a process whereby nutrient runoff causes the excess growth of microorganisms
depleting dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna
A similar process occurs in the marine nitrogen cycle where the ammonification nitrification and denitrification
processes are performed by marine bacteria Some of this nitrogen falls to the ocean floor as sediment which
can then be moved to land in geologic time by uplift of the Earths surface and thereby incorporated into
terrestrial rock Although the movement of nitrogen from rock directly into living systems has been traditionally
seen as insignificant compared with nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere a recent study showed that this process
may indeed be significant and should be included in any study of the global nitrogen cycle

The Phosphorus Cycle
Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for living processes it is a major component of nucleic acid and
phospholipids and as calcium phosphate makes up the supportive components of our bones Phosphorus is
often the limiting nutrient necessary for growth in aquatic ecosystems Figure 4618
Phosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion PO43 In addition to phosphate runoff as a result of
human activity natural surface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphatecontaining rock by weathering
thus sending phosphates into rivers lakes and the ocean This rock has its origins in the ocean Phosphate
containing ocean sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions
However in remote regions volcanic ash aerosols and mineral dust may also be significant phosphate sources
This sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the uplifting of areas of the Earths surface
Phosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marine ecosystems
The movement of phosphate from the ocean to the land and through the soil is extremely slow with the average
phosphate ion having an oceanic residence time between 20000 and 100000 years
Figure 4618 In nature phosphorus exists as the phosphate ion PO43 Weathering of rocks and volcanic activity
releases phosphate into the soil water and air where it becomes available to terrestrial food webs Phosphate enters
the oceans via surface runoff groundwater flow and river flow Phosphate dissolved in ocean water cycles into marine
food webs Some phosphate from the marine food webs falls to the ocean floor where it forms sediment credit
