Bless him look he knows his mommy said Hagrid
Hagrid said Hermione how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow
exactly
Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face
 he leapt to his feet and ran to the window
Whats the matter
Someone was lookin through the gap in the curtains  its a kid 
hes runnin back up ter the school
Harry bolted to the door and looked out Even at a distance there was no
mistaking him
Malfoy had seen the dragon
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoys face during the next week
made Harry Ron and Hermione very nervous They spent most of their
free time in Hagrids darkened hut trying to reason with him
Just let him go Harry urged Set him free
I cant said Hagrid Hes too little Hed die
They looked at the dragon It had grown three times in length in just a
week Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils Hagrid hadnt been doing
his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy There
were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor
Ive decided to call him Norbert said Hagrid looking at the dragon
with misty eyes He really knows me now watch Norbert Norbert
Wheres Mommy
Hes lost his marbles Ron muttered in Harrys ear
Hagrid said Harry loudly give it two weeks and Norberts going to
be as long as your house Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment
Hagrid bit his lip
