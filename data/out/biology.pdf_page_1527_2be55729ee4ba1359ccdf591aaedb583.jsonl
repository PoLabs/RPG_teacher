several plausible hypotheses have been advanced
Five mass extinctions with losses of more than 50 percent of extant species are observable in the fossil record
Biodiversity recovery times after mass extinctions vary but may be as long as 30 million years Recent
extinctions are recorded in written history and are the basis for one method of estimating contemporary
extinction rates The other method uses measures of habitat loss and speciesarea relationships Estimates of
contemporary extinction rates vary but some rates are as high as 500 times the background rate as
determined from the fossil record and are predicted to rise
472 The Importance of Biodiversity to Human Life
Humans use many compounds that were first discovered or derived from living organisms as medicines
secondary plant compounds animal toxins and antibiotics produced by bacteria and fungi More medicines will
undoubtedly be discovered in nature Loss of biodiversity will impact the number of pharmaceuticals available
to humans
Crop diversity is a requirement for food security and it is being lost The loss of wild relatives to crops also
threatens breeders abilities to create new varieties Ecosystems provide ecosystem services that support
human agriculture pollination nutrient cycling pest control and soil development and maintenance Loss of
biodiversity threatens these ecosystem services and risks making food production more expensive or
impossible Wild food sources are mainly aquatic but few of these resources are being managed for
sustainability Fisheries ability to provide protein to human populations is threatened when extinction occurs
Biodiversity may provide important psychological benefits to humans Additionally there are moral arguments
for the maintenance of biodiversity
473 Threats to Biodiversity
The core threats to biodiversity are human population growth and unsustainable resource use To date the
most significant causes of extinctions are habitat loss introduction of exotic species and overharvesting
Climate change is predicted to be a significant cause of extinctions in the coming century Habitat loss occurs
through deforestation damming of rivers and other disruptive human activities Overharvesting is a threat
particularly to aquatic species while the taking of bush meat in the humid tropics threatens many species in
Asia Africa and the Americas Exotic species have been the cause of a number of extinctions and are
especially damaging to islands and lakes Exotic species introductions are increasing damaging native
ecosystems around the world because of the increased mobility of human populations and growing global trade
and transportation Climate change is forcing range changes that may lead to extinction It is also affecting
adaptations to the timing of resource availability that negatively affects species in seasonal environments The
impacts of climate change are greatest in the arctic Global warming will also raise sea levels eliminating some
islands and reducing the area of all others
474 Preserving Biodiversity
New technological methods such as DNA barcoding and information processing and accessibility are
facilitating the cataloging of the planets biodiversity There is also a legislative framework for biodiversity
protection International treaties such as CITES regulate the transportation of endangered species across
international borders Legislation within individual countries protecting species and agreements on global
warming have had limited success the Paris Climate accord is currently being implemented as a means to
reduce global climate change
In the United States the Endangered Species Act protects listed species but is hampered by procedural
difficulties and a focus on individual species The Migratory Bird Act is an agreement between Canada and the
United States to protect migratory birds The nonprofit sector is also very active in conservation efforts in a
variety of ways
Conservation preserves are a major tool in biodiversity protection Presently 11 percent of Earths land surface
is protected in some way The science of island biogeography has informed the optimal design of preserves
however preserves have limitations imposed by political and economic forces In addition climate change will
limit the effectiveness of preserves in the future A downside of preserves is that they may lessen the pressure
on human societies to function more sustainably outside the preserves
Habitat restoration has the potential to restore ecosystems to previous biodiversity levels before species
become extinct Examples of restoration include reintroduction of keystone species and removal of dams on
