Introduction
Improvements in agriculture and the industrial revolution had a profound 
effect on European societies not just economically but also in the way that 
households and families were organised largely through its impact on 
the way that people earned their incomes The timing of the increase in 
agricultural productivity and the industrial revolution differed across the 
continent Its impact was shaped by the preexisting forms of household and 
family organisation and by the political context However the establishment 
of a system whereby income for a large part of the population was earned 
by working in mining industrial establishments and services had a number 
of significant consequences for the family and household First it meant that 
household work in cottage industries began to decline as work was increasingly 
undertaken outside the home Second and relatedly larger family and kinship 
networks were no longer regarded as necessary for contributing to household 
industries and individuals began to seek work elsewhere including far from 
home Finally the shift to industrial work meant that labour increasingly came 
to be seen as something performed by male family breadwinners even if the 
important contributions of women and child workers continued 
These developments of course varied dramatically across Europe and 
even within individual countries For this reason among others historians 
and social scientists have debated whether there has been a single model of the 
European family Some have debated over divisions between northwestern 
Europe and the rest of the continent Others have pointed out specifically 
Eastern European or Southern European family models in which agriculture 
and intergenerational families played a greater role into the early twentieth
