of Respublica Christiana could also denote the idea of a political alliance of 
states with Christian rulers headed by the Pope However the colonial and 
subsequent missionary expansion in the sixteenth century greatly enlarged the 
Christian community and put in doubt this specific way of defining Europe 
The dual inheritance of Europe itselfthe Christian and the classical
encouraged a dual classification of mankind whereby peoples were judged in 
accordance with their religious affiliation or with their degree of civilisation 
The fundamental division along religious lines was between Christian and 
heathen From the sixteenth century onwards Christian scholars slowly 
started to regard Jews certainly not heathens as heirs to a civilised Rabbinic 
tradition and from the seventeenth century onwards these Christian scholars 
also turned to Arabic literature Renaissance Europeans also appropriated 
from classical literature the distinction between Greeks and barbarians the 
barbarian while heathen was also rough and uncivilised As for the cultural 
order then it was since the sixteenth century that the Republic of Letters 
the idea that there was a learned world shared between Europeans replaced 
the idea of a unified Respublica Christiana as the realm of a shared civilisation

only the geographic reach of the Republic of Letters but also that the category 
of Europe covered the widest possible frame of reference for the intellectual 
universe these scholars inhabited For the French writer Voltaire 16941778 
writing in 1751 people from the Pope in Rome to the Tsar in Russia inhabited 
a commonwealth of learning that covered the nations of Europe despite their 
continuous wars and religious differences 
We have gradually seen established in Europe a Learned Republic despite the wars and 
despite the religious differences All the sciences and all the arts have thus helped each 
other The academies have shaped this republic Italy and Russia have been united through 
learning The Englishman the German and the Frenchman went to Leiden to study The 
famous physician Herman Boerhaave gave advice to both the pope and the tsar
