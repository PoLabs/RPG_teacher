CHAPTER SUMMARY
451 Population Demography
Populations are individuals of a species that live in a particular habitat Ecologists measure characteristics of
populations size density dispersion pattern age structure and sex ratio Life tables are useful to calculate life
expectancies of individual population members Survivorship curves show the number of individuals surviving
at each age interval plotted versus time
452 Life Histories and Natural Selection
All species have evolved a pattern of living called a life history strategy in which they partition energy for
growth maintenance and reproduction These patterns evolve through natural selection they allow species to
adapt to their environment to obtain the resources they need to successfully reproduce There is an inverse
relationship between fecundity and parental care A species may reproduce early in life to ensure surviving to a
reproductive age or reproduce later in life to become larger and healthier and better able to give parental care
A species may reproduce once semelparity or many times iteroparity in its life
453 Environmental Limits to Population Growth
Populations with unlimited resources grow exponentially with an accelerating growth rate When resources
become limiting populations follow a logistic growth curve The population of a species will level off at the
carrying capacity of its environment
454 Population Dynamics and Regulation
Populations are regulated by a variety of densitydependent and densityindependent factors Species are
divided into two categories based on a variety of features of their life history patterns rselected species which
have large numbers of offspring and Kselected species which have few offspring The r and Kselection
theory has fallen out of use however many of its key features are still used in newer demographicallybased
models of population dynamics
455 Human Population Growth
The worlds human population is growing at an exponential rate Humans have increased the worlds carrying
capacity through migration agriculture medical advances and communication The age structure of a
population allows us to predict population growth Unchecked human population growth could have dire long
term effects on our environment
456 Community Ecology
Communities include all the different species living in a given area The variety of these species is called
species richness Many organisms have developed defenses against predation and herbivory including
mechanical defenses warning coloration and mimicry as a result of evolution and the interaction with other
members of the community Two species cannot exist in the same habitat competing directly for the same
resources Species may form symbiotic relationships such as commensalism or mutualism Community
structure is described by its foundation and keystone species Communities respond to environmental
disturbances by succession the predictable appearance of different types of plant species until a stable
community structure is established
457 Behavioral Biology Proximate and Ultimate Causes of Behavior
Behaviors are responses to stimuli They can either be instinctualinnate behaviors which are not influenced by
the environment or learned behaviors which are influenced by environmental changes Instinctual behaviors
include mating systems and methods of communication Learned behaviors include imprinting and habituation
conditioning and most powerfully cognitive learning
