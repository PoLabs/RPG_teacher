153  Eukaryotic Transcription
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

List the steps in eukaryotic transcription

Discuss the role of RNA polymerases in transcription

Compare and contrast the three RNA polymerases

Explain the significance of transcription factors
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription with a few key
differences The most important difference between prokaryote and eukaryote transcription is due to the latters
membranebound nucleus and organelles With the genes bound in a nucleus the eukaryotic cell must be
able to transport its mRNA to the cytoplasm and must protect its mRNA from degrading before it is translated
Eukaryotes also employ three different polymerases that each transcribe a different subset of genes Eukaryotic
mRNAs are usually monogenic meaning that they specify a single protein
Initiation of Transcription in Eukaryotes
Unlike the prokaryotic polymerase that can bind to a DNA template on its own eukaryotes require several other
proteins called transcription factors to first bind to the promoter region and then to help recruit the appropriate
polymerase
The Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases
The features of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis are markedly more complex than those of prokaryotes Instead of a
single polymerase comprising five subunits the eukaryotes have three polymerases that are each made up of
10 subunits or more Each eukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to
the DNA template
RNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal RNA rRNA
is transcribed processed and assembled into ribosomes Table 151 The rRNA molecules are considered
structural RNAs because they have a cellular role but are not translated into protein The rRNAs are components
of the ribosome and are essential to the process of translation RNA polymerase I synthesizes all of the rRNAs
from the tandemly duplicated set of 18S 58S and 28S ribosomal genes Note that the S designation applies
to Svedberg units a nonadditive value that characterizes the speed at which a particle sediments during
centrifugation

RNA polymerase II is located in the nucleus and synthesizes all proteincoding nuclear premRNAs Eukaryotic
premRNAs undergo extensive processing after transcription but before translation For clarity this modules
discussion of transcription and translation in eukaryotes will use the term mRNAs to describe only the mature
processed molecules that are ready to be translated RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing the
overwhelming majority of eukaryotic genes
