Figure 1010 The cell cycle is controlled at three checkpoints The integrity of the DNA is assessed at the G1
checkpoint Proper chromosome duplication is assessed at the G2 checkpoint Attachment of each kinetochore to a
spindle fiber is assessed at the M checkpoint
The G1 Checkpoint
The G1 checkpoint determines whether all conditions are favorable for cell division to proceed The G1
checkpoint also called the restriction point in yeast is a point at which the cell irreversibly commits to the cell
division process External influences such as growth factors play a large role in carrying the cell past the G1
checkpoint In addition to adequate reserves and cell size there is a check for genomic DNA damage at the
G1 checkpoint A cell that does not meet all the requirements will not be allowed to progress into the S phase
The cell can halt the cycle and attempt to remedy the problematic condition or the cell can advance into G0 and
await further signals when conditions improve
The G2 Checkpoint
The G2 checkpoint bars entry into the mitotic phase if certain conditions are not met As at the G1 checkpoint
cell size and protein reserves are assessed However the most important role of the G2 checkpoint is to ensure
that all of the chromosomes have been replicated and that the replicated DNA is not damaged If the checkpoint
mechanisms detect problems with the DNA the cell cycle is halted and the cell attempts to either complete DNA
replication or repair the damaged DNA
The M Checkpoint
The M checkpoint occurs near the end of the metaphase stage of karyokinesis The M checkpoint is also known
as the spindle checkpoint because it determines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly attached to the
spindle microtubules Because the separation of the sister chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step
the cycle will not proceed until the kinetochores of each pair of sister chromatids are firmly anchored to at least
two spindle fibers arising from opposite poles of the cell
