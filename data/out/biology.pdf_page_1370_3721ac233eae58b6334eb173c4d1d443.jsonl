holoblastic cleavage Other species such as birds with a lot of yolk in the egg to nourish the embryo during
development undergo meroblastic cleavage
In mammals the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development Here the cells in the blastula
arrange themselves in two layers the inner cell mass and an outer layer called the trophoblast The inner
cell mass is also known as the embryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo At this
stage of development illustrated in Figure 4325 the inner cell mass consists of embryonic stem cells that will
differentiate into the different cell types needed by the organism The trophoblast will contribute to the placenta
and nourish the embryo
Figure 4325 The rearrangement of the cells in the mammalian blastula to two layersthe inner cell mass and the
trophoblastresults in the formation of the blastocyst

Gastrulation
The typical blastula is a ball of cells The next stage in embryonic development is the formation of the body
plan The cells in the blastula rearrange themselves spatially to form three layers of cells This process is called
gastrulation During gastrulation the blastula folds upon itself to form the three layers of cells Each of these
layers is called a germ layer and each germ layer differentiates into different organ systems
The three germ layers shown in Figure 4326 are the endoderm the ectoderm and the mesoderm The
ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermis The mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and
connective tissue in the body The endoderm gives rise to columnar cells found in the digestive system and many
internal organs
