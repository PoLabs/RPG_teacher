of early hygienism the social images of nature evolved in Great Britain the 
aristocracy left the dirty city for the safe countryside and all over Europe 
the mountains which had long been rejected became fashionable for their 
supposed therapeutic virtues
Another significant change in attitude towards the environment concerns 
the measures introduced by states to counteract the negative consequences of 
the exploitation of natural resources Ideas of sustainability were primarily 
applied to the issue of wood management As the use of wood increased 
particularly in shipbuilding it became a precious and strategic resource The 
Republic of Venice had already set an example in the fifteenth century with 
the creation of an administration for the forest resources of its hinterland In 
France the edict of 1669 on water and forests created royal oak groves and 
a forestry administration with sustainable methods During the following 
century state forestry methods would also be implemented by private owners 
and landlords in order to protect their properties in England the adoption of 
the Black Act in 1723 aimed to protect royal and private forests from all acts of 
delinquencywhich were now punishable by death Rural communities were 
thus evicted from the forest and its uses
In the second half of the eighteenth century we can observe the first signs 
of a growing awareness of the need to preserve nature for its own sake 
This awareness grew in the European tropical colonies after the ecocides 
committed to establish a plantation economy during the previous century The 
fashionable theory of desiccation highlighted the interplay between vegetation 
and climate change aridity appeared as the consequence of the lack of rainfall 
caused by deforestation Then in Mauritius in 1769 the French botanist and 
colonial administrator Pierre Poivre 17191786 led an environmental moral 
economy based on a policy of forest conservation and the acclimatisation of 
new plants to put an end to the destruction of nature For British historian 
Richard Grove this conservation policy constituted the invention of ecology 
in the colonies
Conclusion
Early modern Europe witnessed an intensification and expansion of human 
exploitation of the environment Europeans controlled managed and exploited 
the world around them on a scale unknown until then aided by growing state 
power This would not have been possible without a good understanding of 
the environment Learning about the environment and finding out how best 
to deal with it was partly a matter of everyday experience but in the early 
modern period old methods were increasingly supplemented by new ones that 
relied on scientific discoveries novel technologies and rational application
