It was Ginny Weasley Rons younger sister but she wasnt pointing at
Ron
Harry Potter she squealed Look Mom I can see
Be quiet Ginny and its rude to point
Mrs Weasley smiled down at them
Busy year she said
Very said Harry Thanks for the fudge and the sweater Mrs
Weasley
Oh it was nothing dear
Ready are you
It was Uncle Vernon still purplefaced still mustached still looking
furious at the nerve of Harry carrying an owl in a cage in a station
full of ordinary people Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley
looking terrified at the very sight of Harry
You must be Harrys family said Mrs Weasley
In a manner of speaking said Uncle Vernon Hurry up boy we havent
got all day He walked away
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione
See you over the summer then
Hope you have  er  a good holiday said Hermione looking
uncertainly after Uncle Vernon shocked that anyone could be so
unpleasant
Oh I will said Harry and they were surprised at the grin that was
spreading over his face They dont know were not allowed to use magic
at home Im going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer
