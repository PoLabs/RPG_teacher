Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their
heads
Oh well done cried Professor Flitwick clapping Everyone see here
Miss Grangers done it
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class Its no wonder no
one can stand her he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the
crowded corridor shes a nightmare honestly 
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him It was Hermione
Harry caught a glimpse of her face  and was startled to see that she
was in tears
I think she heard you
So said Ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable She mustve noticed
shes got no friends
Hermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all
afternoon On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast
Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that
Hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone
Ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had
entered the Great Hall where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out
of their minds
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a
thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the
candles in the pumpkins stutter The feast appeared suddenly on the
golden plates as it had at the startofterm banquet
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell
came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face
Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledores chair slumped
against the table and gasped Troll  in the dungeons  thought you
ought to know
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint
There was an uproar It took several purple firecrackers exploding from
the end of Professor Dumbledores wand to bring silence
