Figure 114 Random independent assortment during metaphase I can be demonstrated by considering a cell with a
set of two chromosomes n  2 In this case there are two possible arrangements at the equatorial plane in metaphase
I The total possible number of different gametes is 2n where n equals the number of chromosomes in a set In this
example there are four possible genetic combinations for the gametes With n  23 in human cells there are over
eight million possible combinations of paternal and maternal chromosomes
Anaphase I
In anaphase I the microtubules pull the linked chromosomes apart The sister chromatids remain tightly bound
together at the centromere The chiasmata are broken in anaphase I as the microtubules attached to the fused
kinetochores pull the homologous chromosomes apart Figure 115
Telophase I and Cytokinesis
In telophase the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles The remainder of the typical telophase
events may or may not occur depending on the species In some organisms the chromosomes decondense
and nuclear envelopes form around the separated sets of chromatids produced during telophase I In other
organisms

daughter
cellsoccurs without reformation of the nuclei In nearly all species of animals and some fungi cytokinesis
separates the cell contents via a cleavage furrow constriction of the actin ring that leads to cytoplasmic division
In plants a cell plate is formed during cell cytokinesis by Golgi vesicles fusing at the metaphase plate This cell
plate will ultimately lead to the formation of cell walls that separate the two daughter cells
Two haploid cells are the result of the first meiotic division of a diploid cell The cells are haploid because at
each pole there is just one of each pair of the homologous chromosomes Therefore only one full set of the
chromosomes is present This is why the cells are considered haploidthere is only one chromosome set
even though each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids Recall that sister chromatids are merely
duplicates of one of the two homologous chromosomes except for changes that occurred during crossing over
In meiosis II these two sister chromatids will separate creating four haploid daughter cells
