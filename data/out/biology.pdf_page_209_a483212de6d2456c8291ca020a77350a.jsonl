Introduction
The electrical energy plant in Figure 71 converts energy from one form to another form that can be more easily
used This type of generating plant starts with underground thermal energy heat and transforms it into electrical
energy that will be transported to homes and factories Like a generating plant plants and animals also must
take in energy from the environment and convert it into a form that their cells can use Mass and its stored
energy enter an organisms body in one form and are converted into another form that can fuel the organisms
life functions In the process of photosynthesis plants and other photosynthetic producers take in energy in the
form of light solar energy and convert it into chemical energy in the form of glucose which stores this energy
in its chemical bonds Then a series of metabolic pathways collectively called cellular respiration extracts the
energy from the bonds in glucose and converts it into a form that all living things can use
