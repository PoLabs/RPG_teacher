Figure 914 ERK is a MAP kinase that activates translation when it is phosphorylated ERK phosphorylates MNK1
which in turn phosphorylates eIF4E an elongation initiation factor that with other initiation factors is associated with
mRNA When eIF4E becomes phosphorylated the mRNA unfolds allowing protein synthesis in the nucleus to begin
See Figure 910 for the phosphorylation pathway that activates ERK
Another mechanism of gene regulation involves PKC which can interact with is a protein that acts as an inhibitor
An inhibitor is a molecule that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function In this
case the inhibitor is a protein called IB which binds to the regulatory protein NFB The symbol  represents
the Greek letter kappa When IB is bound to NFB the complex cannot enter the nucleus of the cell but
when IB is phosphorylated by PKC it can no longer bind NFB and NFB a transcription factor can enter
the nucleus and initiate RNA transcription In this case the effect of phosphorylation is to inactivate an inhibitor
and thereby activate the process of transcription
Increase in Cellular Metabolism
The result of another signaling pathway affects muscle cells The activation of adrenergic receptors in muscle
cells by adrenaline leads to an increase in cyclic AMP cAMP inside the cell Also known as epinephrine
adrenaline is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland located on top of the kidney that readies the
body for shortterm emergencies Cyclic AMP activates PKA protein kinase A which in turn phosphorylates
two enzymes The first enzyme promotes the degradation of glycogen by activating intermediate glycogen
phosphorylase kinase GPK that in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase GP that catabolizes glycogen into
its constituent glucose monomers Recall that your body converts excess glucose to glycogen for shortterm
storage When energy is needed glycogen is quickly reconverted to glucose Phosphorylation of the second
enzyme glycogen synthase GS inhibits its ability to form glycogen from glucose In this manner a muscle cell
obtains a ready pool of glucose by activating its formation via glycogen degradation and by inhibiting the use of
glucose to form glycogen thus preventing a futile cycle of glycogen degradation and synthesis The glucose is
then available for use by the muscle cell in response to a sudden surge of adrenalinethe fight or flight reflex
Cell Growth
Cell signaling pathways also play a major role in cell division Cells do not normally divide unless they are
stimulated by signals from other cells The ligands that promote cell growth are called growth factors Most
growth factors bind to cellsurface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases These cellsurface receptors
are called receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs Activation of RTKs initiates a signaling pathway that includes a G
