Ive never seen Snape look so mean he told Hermione Look theyre
off Ouch
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head It was Malfoy
Oh sorry Weasley didnt see you there
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle
Wonder how long Potters going to stay on his broom this time Anyone
want a bet What about you Weasley
Ron didnt answer Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because
George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him Hermione who had all her
fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at Harry who was
circling the game like a hawk looking for the Snitch
You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team said
Malfoy loudly a few minutes later as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another
penalty for no reason at all Its people they feel sorry for See
theres Potter whos got no parents then theres the Weasleys whove
got no money  you should be on the team Longbottom youve got no
brains
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy
Im worth twelve of you Malfoy he stammered
Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle howled with laughter but Ron still not
daring to take his eyes from the game said You tell him Neville
Longbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than Weasley and
thats saying something
Rons nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety
about Harry
Im warning you Malfoy  one more word
Ron said Hermione suddenly Harry 
What Where
