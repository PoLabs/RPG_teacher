Nervous Tissues
Nervous tissues are made of cells specialized to receive and transmit electrical impulses from specific areas of
the body and to send them to specific locations in the body The main cell of the nervous system is the neuron
illustrated in Figure 3319 The large structure with a central nucleus is the cell body of the neuron Projections
from the cell body are either dendrites specialized in receiving input or a single axon specialized in transmitting
impulses Some glial cells are also shown Astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell and
oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently Other glial cells
that are not shown support the nutritional and waste requirements of the neuron Some of the glial cells are
phagocytic and remove debris or damaged cells from the tissue A nerve consists of neurons and glial cells
Figure 3319 The neuron has projections called dendrites that receive signals and projections called axons that send
signals Also shown are two types of glial cells astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell and
oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently

Pathologist
A pathologist is a medical doctor or veterinarian who has specialized in the laboratory detection of disease
in animals including humans These professionals complete medical school education and follow it with an
extensive postgraduate residency at a medical center A pathologist may oversee clinical laboratories for
the evaluation of body tissue and blood samples for the detection of disease or infection They examine
tissue specimens through a microscope to identify cancers and other diseases Some pathologists perform
autopsies to determine the cause of death and the progression of disease
