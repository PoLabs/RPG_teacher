mainly Orthodox Serb population at the turn of the fifteenth century This first 
wave of refugees was partly absorbed by the border defence establishments and 
partly by the lands of the nobles In parallel ethnic Turks migrated westward 
especially into the Balkans as colonists from Anatolia followed the Ottoman 
armiessometimes voluntarily sometimes as a result of forced resettlement 
programmeswith the aim of consolidating Ottoman rule over the recently 
conquered territories As the expansion moved closer to central Europe and 
especially after the occupation of Belgrade 1521 and Buda 1541 an ever
growing number of Balkan people also settled in the lands conquered from the 
Kingdom of Hungary In fact the people serving in Ottoman border fortresses 
were mostly Bosniaks Serbs and Albanians who had recently converted to 
Islam as well as Serbs Vlachs and Croats who remained Christians
On the whole the more affluent among the Hungarian Croatian and 
German population of these regions left the territories conquered by the 
Ottomans The burghers whofor the most partwere ethnic Germans were 
received by Vienna and the northern Hungarian royal free cities because of 
their previous trade relations Some of the Croatians settled in eastern Austria 
where they played an important part in the protection of its borders while 
the others along with the Hungarian nobility moved to the northern part of 
Hungary which came under Habsburg rule after the death of King Louis II 
r 15161526 in the Battle of Mohacs 1526 The inhabitants of the market 
towns and villages however largely remained While earlier generations of 
historians had assumed that they migrated on a large scale it has been shown 
that they only left temporarily fleeing into the surrounding woods and 
swamps to escape the devastation of war or tax collectors later returning to 
their homes to continue farming or to market towns where safer and more 
favourable economic conditions could be negotiated with the Ottoman rulers
The greatest migration flows in EastCentral and SouthEastern Europe 
were caused by the great wars such as the socalled Long War 15931606 
and the conquest of Hungary by the Habsburgs at the end of the seventeenth 
century In these instances we cannot talk about refugee populations but 
about population exchangeas the more or less complete depopulation of 
rich agricultural areas and river valleys was followed by immigration from 
poorer peripheral regions As a result Slovaks and Russians moved farther 
south and Croats Serbs who had already established major colonies north 
of Buda and Romanians arrived in great numbers At the same time both 
central government and local landlords implemented settlement policies
culminating in the first half of the eighteenth century when Emperor Charles 
VI at enormous expense brought nearly 400000 settlers to Hungary most of 
them from South Germany As they were settled en bloc in largely depopulated 
areas this migration caused significant ethnic changes
