The RedHeaded League
again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses
Finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and hav
ing thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his
stick two or three times he went up to the door and
knocked It was instantly opened by a brightlooking
cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step in
Thank you said Holmes I only wished to ask
you how you would go from here to the Strand
Third right fourth left answered the assistant
promptly closing the door
Smart fellow that observed Holmes as we
walked away He is in my judgment the fourth
smartest man in London and for daring I am not sure
that he has not a claim to be third I have known
something of him before
Evidently said I Mr Wilsons assistant counts
for a good deal in this mystery of the Redheaded
League I am sure that you inquired your way merely
in order that you might see him
Not him
What then
The knees of his trousers
And what did you see
What I expected to see
Why did you beat the pavement
My dear doctor this is a time for observation
not for talk We are spies in an enemys country We
know something of SaxeCoburg Square Let us now
explore the parts which lie behind it
The road in which we found ourselves as we
turned round the corner from the retired SaxeCoburg
Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front
of a picture does to the back It was one of the main
arteries which conveyed the trafc of the City to the
north and west The roadway was blocked with the
immense stream of commerce owing in a double tide
inward and outward while the footpaths were black
with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians It was dif
cult to realise as we looked at the line of ne shops
and stately business premises that they really abutted
on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
which we had just quitted
Let me see said Holmes standing at the corner
and glancing along the line I should like just to re
member the order of the houses here It is a hobby of
mine to have an exact knowledge of London There is
Mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop
the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank
the Vegetarian Restaurant and McFarlanes carriage
building depot That carries us right on to the other
block And now Doctor weve done our work so its
time we had some play A sandwich and a cup of
coffee and then off to violinland where all is sweet
ness and delicacy and harmony and there are no
redheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums
My friend was an enthusiastic musician being
himself not only a very capable performer but a com
poser of no ordinary merit
All the afternoon he
sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happi
ness gently waving his long thin ngers in time to
the music while his gently smiling face and his lan
guid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes
the sleuthhound Holmes the relentless keenwitted
readyhanded criminal agent as it was possible to con
ceive In his singular character the dual nature alter
nately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and
astuteness represented as I have often thought the
reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood
which occasionally predominated in him The swing
of his nature took him from extreme languor to de
vouring energy and as I knew well he was never so
truly formidable as when for days on end he had
been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisa
tions and his blackletter editions Then it was that the
lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and
that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the
level of intuition until those who were unacquainted
with his methods would look askance at him as on a
man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals
When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the
music at St Jamess Hall I felt that an evil time might
be coming upon those whom he had set himself to
hunt down
You want to go home no doubt Doctor he
remarked as we emerged
Yes it would be as well
And I have some business to do which will take
some hours This business at Coburg Square is seri
ous
Why serious
A considerable crime is in contemplation I have
every reason to believe that we shall be in time to
stop it But today being Saturday rather complicates
matters I shall want your help tonight
At what time
Ten will be early enough
I shall be at Baker Street at ten
Very well And I say Doctor there may be some
little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your
pocket He waved his hand turned on his heel and
disappeared in an instant among the crowd
