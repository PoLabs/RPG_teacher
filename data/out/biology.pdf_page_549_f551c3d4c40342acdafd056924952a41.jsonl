The diagrams above can serve as a pathway to understanding evolutionary history We can trace the pathway
from the origin of life to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two
points Also by starting with a single species and tracing back towards the trunk of the tree one can discover
species ancestors as well as where lineages share a common ancestry In addition we can use the tree to
study entire groups of organisms
Another point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change
the information For example if a branch point rotated and the taxon order changed this would not alter the
information because each taxons evolution from the branch point was independent of the other
Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over
time these disciplines together contribute to building updating and maintaining the tree of life Systematics is
the field that scientists use to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships Researchers
may use data from fossils from studying the body part structures or molecules that an organism uses and
DNA analysis By combining data from many sources scientists can construct an organisms phylogeny Since
phylogenetic trees are hypotheses they will continue to change as researchers discover new types of life and
learn new information
Limitations of Phylogenetic Trees
It may be easy to assume that more closely related organisms look more alike and while this is often the case
it is not always true If two closely related lineages evolved under significantly varied surroundings it is possible
for the two groups to appear more different than other groups that are not as closely related For example the
phylogenetic tree in Figure 204 shows that lizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs whereas frogs do not
Yet lizards and frogs appear more similar than lizards and rabbits
Figure 204 An organism that lacked a vertebral column roots this ladderlike phylogenetic tree of vertebrates At each
branch point scientists place organisms with different characters in different groups based on shared characteristics
Another aspect of phylogenetic trees is that unless otherwise indicated the branches do not account for length
of time only the evolutionary order In other words a branchs length does not typically mean more time passed
nor does a short branch mean less time passed unless specified on the diagram For example in Figure 204
the tree does not indicate how much time passed between the evolution of amniotic eggs and hair What the
tree does show is the order in which things took place Again using Figure 204 the tree shows that the oldest
trait is the vertebral column followed by hinged jaws and so forth Remember that any phylogenetic tree is a
part of the greater whole and like a real tree it does not grow in only one direction after a new branch develops
Thus for the organisms in Figure 204 just because a vertebral column evolved does not mean that invertebrate
evolution ceased It only means that a new branch formed Also groups that are not closely related but evolve
under similar conditions may appear more phenotypically similar to each other than to a close relative
