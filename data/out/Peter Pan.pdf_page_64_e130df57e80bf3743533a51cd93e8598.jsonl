Chapter XI
WENDYS STORY
Listen then said Wendy settling down to her story with
Michael at her feet and seven boys in the bed There was once a
gentleman
I had rather he had been a lady Curly said
I wish he had been a white rat said Nibs
Quiet their mother admonished them There was a lady also
and
Oh mummy cried the first twin you mean that there is a lady
also dont you She is not dead is she
Oh no
I am awfully glad she isnt dead said Tootles Are you glad
John
Of course I am
Are you glad Nibs
Rather
Are you glad Twins
We are glad
Oh dear sighed Wendy
Little less noise there Peter called out determined that she
should have fair play however beastly a story it might be in his
opinion
The gentlemans name Wendy continued was Mr Darling
and her name was Mrs Darling
I knew them John said to annoy the others
I think I knew them said Michael rather doubtfully
They were married you know explained Wendy and what do
you think they had
White rats cried Nibs inspired
No
Its awfully puzzling said Tootles who knew the story by heart
Quiet Tootles They had three descendants
What is descendants
Well you are one Twin
Did you hear that John I am a descendant
Descendants are only children said John
Oh dear oh dear sighed Wendy Now these three children had
a faithful nurse called Nana but Mr Darling was angry with her and
chained her up in the yard and so all the children flew away
Its an awfully good story said Nibs
