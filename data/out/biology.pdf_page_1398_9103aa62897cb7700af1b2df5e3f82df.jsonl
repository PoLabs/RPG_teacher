Arctic Tundra
The Arctic tundra lies north of the subarctic boreal forest and is located throughout the Arctic regions of the
northern hemisphere Figure 4412 The average winter temperature is 34 C 292 F and the average
summer temperature is from 3 C to 12 C 37 F52 F Plants in the arctic tundra have a very short growing
season of approximately 1012 weeks
However during this time there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid The annual
precipitation of the Arctic tundra is very low with little annual variation in precipitation And as in the boreal
forests there is little evaporation due to the cold temperatures
Plants in the Arctic tundra are generally low to the ground Figure 4420 There is little species diversity low net
primary productivity and low aboveground biomass The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially
frozen state referred to as permafrost The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the
soil and slows the decay of organic matter which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter During the
growing season the ground of the Arctic tundra can be completely covered with plants or lichens
