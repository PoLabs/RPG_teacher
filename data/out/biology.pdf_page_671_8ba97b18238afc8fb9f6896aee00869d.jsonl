cells causing the patient to lapse into a coma and eventually die During epidemic periods mortality from the
disease can be high Greater surveillance and control measures lead to a reduction in reported cases some of
the lowest numbers reported in 50 years fewer than 10000 cases in all of subSaharan Africa have happened

This movie httpopenstaxcollegeorglAfrican_sleep discusses the pathogenesis of Trypanosoma
brucei the causative agent of African sleeping sickness
In Latin America another species of trypanosome T cruzi is responsible for Chagas disease T cruzi infections
are mainly caused by a bloodsucking kissing bug in the genus Triatoma These true bugs bite the host during
the night and then defecate on the wound transmitting the trypanosome to the victim The victim scratches the
wound further inoculating the site with trypanosomes at the location of the bite After about 10 weeks individuals
enter the chronic phase but most never develop further symptoms In about 30 percent of cases however the
trypanosome causes further damage especially to the heart and digestive system tissues in the chronic phase
of infection leading to malnutrition and heart failure due to abnormal heart rhythms An estimated 10 million
people are infected with Chagas disease and it caused 10000 deaths in 2008
