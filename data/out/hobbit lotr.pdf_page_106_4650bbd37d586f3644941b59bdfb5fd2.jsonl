The wind went on from West to East
all movement in the forest ceased
but shrill and harsh across the marsh
its whistling voices were released
The grasses hissed their tassels bent
the reeds were rattlingon it went
oer shaken pool under heavens cool
where racing clouds were torn and rent
It passed the lonely Mountain bare
and swept above the dragons lair
there black and dark lay boulders stark
and flying smoke was in the air
It left the world and took its flight
over the wide seas of the night
The moon set sail upon the gale
and stars were fanned to leaping light
Bilbo began to nod again Suddenly up stood Gandalf
It is time for us to sleep he said for us but not I think for Beorn In
this hall we can rest sound and safe but I warn you all not to forget what Beorn
said before he left us you must not stray outside until the sun is up on your
peril
Bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall on a sort of
raised platform between the pillars and the outer wall For him there was a little
mattress of straw and woollen blankets He snuggled into them very gladly
summertime though it was The fire burned low and he fell asleep Yet in the
night he woke the fire had now sunk to a few embers the dwarves and Gandalf
were all asleep to judge by their breathing a splash of white on the floor came
from the high moon which was peering down through the smokehole in the
roof
There was a growling sound outside and a noise as of some great animal
