Figure 424 Intermediate filaments consist of several intertwined strands of fibrous proteins
Intermediate filaments have no role in cell movement Their function is purely structural They bear tension
thus maintaining the cells shape and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place Figure 422 shows how
intermediate filaments create a supportive scaffolding inside the cell
The intermediate filaments are the most diverse group of cytoskeletal elements Several fibrous protein types
are in the intermediate filaments You are probably most familiar with keratin the fibrous protein that strengthens
your hair nails and the skins epidermis
Microtubules
As their name implies microtubules are small hollow tubes Polymerized dimers of tubulin and tubulin two
globular proteins comprise the microtubules walls Figure 425 With a diameter of about 25 nm microtubules
are cytoskeletons widest components They help the cell resist compression provide a track along which
vesicles move through the cell and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell Like
microfilaments microtubules can disassemble and reform quickly
Figure 425 Microtubules are hollow Their walls consist of 13 polymerized dimers of tubulin and tubulin right
image The left image shows the tubes molecular structure
Microtubules are also the structural elements of flagella cilia and centrioles the latter are the centrosomes two
perpendicular bodies In animal cells the centrosome is the microtubuleorganizing center In eukaryotic cells
flagella and cilia are quite different structurally from their counterparts in prokaryotes as we discuss below
Flagella and Cilia
The flagella singular  flagellum are long hairlike structures that extend from the plasma membrane and
enable an entire cell to move for example sperm Euglena and some prokaryotes When present the cell has
just one flagellum or a few flagella However when cilia singular  cilium are present many of them extend
along the plasma membranes entire surface They are short hairlike structures that move entire cells such as
paramecia or substances along the cells outer surface for example the cilia of cells lining the Fallopian tubes
that move the ovum toward the uterus or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that trap particulate matter
and move it toward your nostrils
Despite their differences in length and number flagella and cilia share a common structural arrangement of
microtubules called a 9  2 array This is an appropriate name because a single flagellum or cilium is made of
a ring of nine microtubule doublets surrounding a single microtubule doublet in the center Figure 426
