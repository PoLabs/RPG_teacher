bacteriophagea virus that infects bacteria Viruses typically have a simple structure a protein coat called
the capsid and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic material either DNA or RNA The bacteriophage
infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the
cell The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery and eventually the host cell
bursts releasing a large number of bacteriophages Hershey and Chase selected radioactive elements that
would specifically distinguish the protein from the DNA in infected cells They labeled one batch of phage
with radioactive sulfur 35S to label the protein coat Another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive
phosphorus 32P Because phosphorous is found in DNA but not protein the DNA and not the protein would
be tagged with radioactive phosphorus Likewise sulfur is absent from DNA but present in several amino acids
such as methionine and cysteine
Each batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately After infection the phage bacterial suspension
was put in a blender which caused the phage coat to detach from the host cell Cells exposed long enough
for infection to occur were then examined to see which of the two radioactive molecules had entered the cell
The phage and bacterial suspension was spun down in a centrifuge The heavier bacterial cells settled down
and formed a pellet whereas the lighter phage particles stayed in the supernatant In the tube that contained
phage labeled with 35S the supernatant contained the radioactively labeled phage whereas no radioactivity was
detected in the pellet In the tube that contained the phage labeled with 32P the radioactivity was detected in the
pellet that contained the heavier bacterial cells and no radioactivity was detected in the supernatant Hershey
and Chase concluded that it was the phage DNA that was injected into the cell and carried information to produce
more phage particles thus providing evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins Figure 144
Figure 144 In Hershey and Chases experiments bacteria were infected with phage radiolabeled with either 35S
which labels protein or 32P which labels DNA Only 32P entered the bacterial cells indicating that DNA is the genetic
material
Around this same time Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff examined the content of DNA in different species
and found that the amounts of adenine thymine guanine and cytosine were not found in equal quantities and
that relative concentrations of the four nucleotide bases varied from species to species but not within tissues
