Web development and design 
JavaScript 
This is the most common clientside language used to create rich dynamic web properties 
Because it is an opensource language many developers have added functionality that can be 
more quickly implemented For example there are over1000 different gallery systems created 
by JavaScript developers for JavaScript developers 
Frameworks 
Frameworks are packages that are made up of a structure of files and folders of standardised 
code HTML CSS and JavaScript for example which can be used as the basis for developing 
websites Essentially frameworks are templates to provide the common structure for websites 
so that developers dont need to start from scratch each time Frameworks save a lot of time 
and money 
Some examples include vuejs backbonejs angularJS emberJS reactjs and the popular 
jQuery libraries Bootstrap has long been the most popular CSS framework and bulma is also 
increasing in popularity 
744 Development best practice 
There are multiple ways to design and develop for the web but it is a good idea to learn from 
the best in the industry and to follow some best practice guidelines to achieve the best results
Meta and title tag customisation 
The CMS you have either selected or created should allow you to enter your own meta tags 
for each page as well as allow full customisation of title tags for each page It is important to 
note that Google does not use keyword meta tags for ranking anymore Lincoln 2015
URLs 
Instead of using dynamic parameters the CMS should allow for clean URLs by using server
side rewriting Clean URLs consist only of the path to a webpage without extra code A clean 
URL could look like this examplecomcats while an unclean URL could look like this example
comindexphppagecats It should allow for the creation of URLs that are 
	
Static 
	
Rewritable 
	
Keyword rich 
Be careful when building clean descriptive and dynamic URLs from CMS content Should 
you use a news headline for example Storm as part of your URL and someone changes the 
heading to Tornado this will alter the URL and the search engines will index this as a new 
page but with the same content as the URL which had the old heading Bear this in mind 
before adding dynamic parameters to your URLs
