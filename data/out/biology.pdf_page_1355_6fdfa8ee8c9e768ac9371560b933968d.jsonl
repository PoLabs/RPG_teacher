The breasts consist of mammary glands and fat The size of the breast is determined by the amount of fat
deposited behind the gland Each gland consists of 15 to 25 lobes that have ducts that empty at the nipple and
that supply the nursing child with nutrient and antibodyrich milk to aid development and protect the child
Internal female reproductive structures include ovaries oviducts the uterus and the vagina shown in Figure
4310 The pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments Ovaries consist of
a medulla and cortex the medulla contains nerves and blood vessels to supply the cortex with nutrients and
remove waste The outer layers of cells of the cortex are the functional parts of the ovaries The cortex is made
up of follicular cells that surround eggs that develop during fetal development in utero During the menstrual
period a batch of follicular cells develops and prepares the eggs for release At ovulation one follicle ruptures
and one egg is released as illustrated in Figure 4311a
Figure 4311 Oocytes develop in a follicles located in the ovary At the beginning of the menstrual cycle the follicle
matures At ovulation the follicle ruptures releasing the egg The follicle becomes a corpus luteum which eventually
degenerates The b follicle in this light micrograph has an oocyte at its center credit a modification of work by NIH

The oviducts or fallopian tubes extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries but they
are not in contact with the ovaries The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpetlike structure and
have a fringe of fingerlike projections called fimbriae illustrated in Figure 4310b When an egg is released at
ovulation the fimbrae help the nonmotile egg enter into the tube and passage to the uterus The walls of the
oviducts are ciliated and are made up mostly of smooth muscle The cilia beat toward the middle and the smooth
muscle contracts in the same direction moving the egg toward the uterus Fertilization usually takes place within
the oviducts and the developing embryo is moved toward the uterus for development It usually takes the egg or
embryo a week to travel through the oviduct Sterilization in women is called a tubal ligation it is analogous to a
