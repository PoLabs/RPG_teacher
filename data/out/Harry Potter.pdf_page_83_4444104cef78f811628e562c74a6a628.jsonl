83
away from me
Hell turn up said Harry
Yes said the boy miserably Well if you see him
He left
Dont know why hes so bothered said Ron If Id brought a toad Id
lose it as quick as I could Mind you I brought Scabbers so I cant
talk
The rat was still snoozing on Rons lap
He might have died and you wouldnt know the difference said Ron in
disgust I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more
interesting but the spell didnt work Ill show you look
He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very batteredlooking
wand It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the
end
Unicorn hairs nearly poking out Anyway
He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again
The toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him She was
already wearing her new Hogwarts robes
Has anyone seen a toad Nevilles lost one she said She had a bossy
sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth
Weve already told him we havent seen it said Ron but the girl
wasnt listening she was looking at the wand in his hand
Oh are you doing magic Lets see it then
She sat down Ron looked taken aback
Er  all right
He cleared his throat
Sunshine daisies butter mellow Turn this stupid fat rat yellow
