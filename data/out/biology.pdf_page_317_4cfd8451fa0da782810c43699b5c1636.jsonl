Introduction
The ability to reproduce is a basic characteristic of all organisms Hippopotamuses give birth to hippopotamus
calves Joshua trees produce seeds from which Joshua tree seedlings emerge and adult flamingos lay eggs
that hatch into flamingo chicks However unlike the organisms shown above offspring may or may not resemble
their parents For example in the case of most insects such as butterflies with a complete metamorphosis the
larval forms rarely resemble the adult forms
Although many unicellular organisms and a few multicellular organisms can produce genetically identical clones
of themselves through asexual reproduction many singlecelled organisms and most multicellular organisms
reproduce regularly using another methodsexual reproduction This highly evolved method involves the
production by parents of two haploid cells and the fusion of two haploid cells to form a single genetically
recombined diploid cella genetically unique organism Haploid cells that are part of the sexual reproductive
cycle are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis Sexual reproduction involving both meiosis
and fertilization introduces variation into offspring that may account for the evolutionary success of sexual
reproduction The vast majority of eukaryotic organisms both multicellular and unicellular can or must employ
some form of meiosis and fertilization to reproduce
In most plants and animals through thousands of rounds of mitotic cell division diploid cells whether produced
by asexual or sexual reproduction will develop into an adult organism
