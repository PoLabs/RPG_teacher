archipelago they measured their bodies and particularly their skulls in an 
attempt to arrive at a racial classification of indigenous peoples Although 
it turned out to be impossible to establish any sound racial divisions this 
scientific work supported the racial ideology underpinning the entire colonial

shaped society
State Control Bureaucratisation and Professionalisation
In the nineteenth century a growing bureaucratisation of secondary and tertiary 
education became apparent Governments in many countries established 
centralised state administrations that could address general challenges in 
science education and culture In an early example of a centralised educational 
system the socalled Studienhofkommission was established in 1760 in the 
countries of the Habsburg Monarchy serving as the main state body for all 
schools priest houses universities and academies The Studienhofkommission 
merged into the Ministerium des ffentlichen Unterrichtes established in 1848 
Another example is the French Ministre de lInstruction publique founded 
in 1828 Such administrations were intended to allow the government to 
coordinate and reform educational activities in general particularly in higher 
education This trend was evident even in federally organised states like the 
German Reich In 1898 Friedrich Althoff Ministerial Director in the Prussian 
Kultusministerium suggested bringing together senior officials from regional 
state ministries to form a higher education conference of the German Reich 
Althoffs initiative led to a permanent body that met regularly and can be seen 
as the forerunner of todays Kultusministerkonferenz Standing Conference of 
Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs Even with its federal structure 
the German Reich attempted to ensure that the nationstate would be able to 
act in the education sector
The example of Habsburg Central Europe shows a serious attempt at 
centralised coordination in research and education with varying results 
on the local level The idea of general schooling was conceived as early as 
the late eighteenth century though the results fell short of expectations 
Schooling improved a great deal during the century and illiteracy decreased 
considerably as a result but there were significant differences between the 
regions and nationalities of the empire Whereas the Czech Lands already 
boasted an impressive schooling system in the 1820s illiteracy levels in Galicia 
remained extremely high even in the 1870s Despite such setbacks it remained 
the concern of the state in most parts of Europe to steer science and education 
systematically
