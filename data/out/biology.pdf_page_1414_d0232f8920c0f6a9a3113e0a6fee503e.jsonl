CHAPTER SUMMARY
441 The Scope of Ecology
Ecology is the study of the interactions of living things with their environment Ecologists ask questions that
comprise four levels of general biological organizationorganismal population community and ecosystem At
the organismal level ecologists study individual organisms and how they interact with their environments At
the population and community levels ecologists explore respectively how a population of organisms changes
over time and the ways in which that population interacts with other species in the community Ecologists
studying an ecosystem examine the living species the biotic components of the ecosystem as well as the
nonliving portions the abiotic components such as air water and soil of the environment
442 Biogeography
Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things as well as the abiotic factors that affect
their distribution Endemic species are species that are naturally found only in a specific geographic area The
distribution of living things is influenced by several environmental factors that are in part controlled by the
latitude or elevation at which a species is found Ocean upwellings and spring and fall turnovers are important
processes regulating the distribution of nutrients and other abiotic factors important in aquatic ecosystems
Energy sources temperature water inorganic nutrients and soil are factors limiting the distribution of living
things in terrestrial systems Net primary productivity is a measure of the amount of biomass produced by a
biome
443 Terrestrial Biomes
The Earth has terrestrial biomes and aquatic biomes Aquatic biomes include both freshwater and marine
environments There are eight major terrestrial biomes tropical wet forests savannas subtropical deserts
chaparral temperate grasslands temperate forests boreal forests and Arctic tundra The same biome can
