34 PEACE AND CONFLICT

peace movement was a heterogeneous phenomenon encompassing a broad 
spectrum of autonomous activists and youth movements but also institutions 
such as political parties trade unions and churches
Civil Wars
While the advent of the modern nation state changed the nature of war 
through universal conscription war also changed nations for it turned out 
to be a highly effective instrument for unifying territories and nationalising 
populations War nationalises territories and renders national traditions 
sacred and immaculate War therefore provides an occasion for accelerated 
homogenisation of national cultures thus acting as a crucible for nations But 
war may also be a major factor hastening national dissolution There are two 
telling illustrations of this in the twentieth century the dismantling of great 
empires and internal conflicts within existing nations
In 1914 the AustroHungarian authorities feared separatism from the 
national minorities which resided within the empire yet loyalty to the 
dynasty prevailed through to 1916 Even in the Russian Empire the national 
representatives at the exceptional sitting of the Duma in August 1914 clearly 
asserted their loyalty to the Russian state But over the course of the conflict 
the limits to the community of combatants became clear for army discipline 
was not based solely on patriotism but also on constraint obedience and 
social pressure From 1916 onwards the largest number of defections from 
the AustroHungarian Army were by national minorities Czechs Slovaks 
and Croats who refused to shoot at Russians or Serbs on the grounds of pan
Slavism Thus nationalist demands were strengthened by the war though still 
linked to political and social matters
The emergence of new conflicts within communities which were nominally 
homogenous in national terms followed a different patternconflicts in 
nations such as Finland 1918 Spain 19361939 Italy 19431945 and 
Greece 19461949 The battles between liberal democracy and communism 
in the 1920s Finland between democracies and fascism in the 1930s Spain 
and as part of the Cold War after 1947 Greece were not fought primarily 
along ideological more than national lines Each of the various camps claimed 
to embody national independence inexorably leading to civil wars with 
revolutionary tones These civil wars were the theatre for overt international 
interventions such as that of Bolshevik Russia in Finland of fascist Germany 
Italy and Portugal in Spain and of Yugoslavia the United Kingdom and later 
the United States in Greece Rebuilding national unity after these internal wars 
came at the cost of fierce repression of the defeated camp
