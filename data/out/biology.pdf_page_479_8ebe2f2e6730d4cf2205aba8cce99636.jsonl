Figure 178 Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be cloned To create Dolly they removed the nucleus from a
donor egg cell They then introduced the nucleus from a second sheep into the cell which divided to the blastocyst
stage before they implanted it in a surrogate mother credit modification of work by SquidoniusWikimedia

Do you think Dolly was a FinnDorset or a Scottish Blackface sheep
Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering is the alteration of an organisms genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify
an organisms DNA to achieve desirable traits The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA
vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering The organism that
receives the recombinant DNA is a genetically modified organism GMO If the foreign DNA comes from a
different species the host organism is transgenic Scientists have genetically modified bacteria plants and
animals since the early 1970s for academic medical agricultural and industrial purposes In the US GMOs
such as Roundupready soybeans and borerresistant corn are part of many common processed foods
Gene Targeting
Although classical methods of studying gene function began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic
basis of that phenotype modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask What
does this gene or DNA element do This technique reverse genetics has resulted in reversing the classic
genetic methodology This method would be similar to damaging a body part to determine its function An insect
that loses a wing cannot fly which means that the wings function is flight The classical genetic method would
compare insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly and observe that the nonflying insects have lost wings
Similarly mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function We collectively call
the methods they use to disable gene function gene targeting Gene targeting is the use of recombinant DNA
vectors to alter a particular genes expression either by introducing mutations in a gene or by eliminating a
certain genes expression by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the organisms genome
