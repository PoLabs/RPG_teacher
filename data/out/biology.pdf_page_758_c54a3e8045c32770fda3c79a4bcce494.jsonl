just the ovary For instance strawberries are derived from the ovary as well as the receptacle and apples are
formed from the ovary and the pericarp or hypanthium Some fruits are derived from separate ovaries in a single
flower such as the raspberry Other fruits such as the pineapple form from clusters of flowers Additionally
some fruits like watermelon and orange have rinds Regardless of how they are formed fruits are an agent of
seed dispersal The variety of shapes and characteristics reflect the mode of dispersal Wind carries the light
dry fruits of trees and dandelions Water transports floating coconuts Some fruits attract herbivores with their
color or scent or as food Once eaten tough undigested seeds are dispersed through the herbivores feces
endozoochory Other fruits have burrs and hooks to cling to fur and hitch rides on animals epizoochory
Diversity of Angiosperms
Angiosperms are classified in a single phylum the Anthophyta Modern angiosperms appear to be a
monophyletic group which as you may recall means that they originated from a single ancestor Within the
angiosperms are three major groups basal angiosperms monocots and dicots Basal angiosperms are a group
of plants that are believed to have branched off before the separation of the monocots and eudicots because
they exhibit traits from both groups They are categorized separately in most classification schemes The basal
angiosperms include Amborella water lilies the Magnoliids magnolia trees laurels and spice peppers and
a group called the Austrobaileyales which includes the star anise The monocots and dicots are differentiated
on the basis of the structure of the cotyledons pollen grains and other structures Monocots include grasses
and lilies and the dicots form a multibranched group that includes among many others roses cabbages
sunflowers and mints
Basal Angiosperms
The Magnoliidae are represented by the magnolias laurels and peppers Magnolias are tall trees bearing dark
shiny leaves and large fragrant flowers with many parts and are considered archaic Figure 2617 In the outer
whorl of the magnolia flower the sepals and petals are undifferentiated and are collectively called tepals The
reproductive parts are arranged in a spiral around a coneshaped receptacle with the carpels located above the
stamens Figure 2617 The aggregate fruit with one seed formed from each carpel is seen in Figure 2618d
Laurel trees produce fragrant leaves and small inconspicuous flowers The Laurales grow mostly in warmer
climates and are small trees and shrubs Familiar plants in this group include the bay laurel cinnamon spice
bush Figure 2618a and avocado tree
Figure 2617 Magnolia grandiflora A cluster of carpels can be seen above the stamens which have shed their
pollen and begun to drop from the inflorescence In the flower the sepals and petals are undifferentiated and are
collectively called tepals credit Ianar Svi httpbioimagesvanderbiltedubaskauf10949 httpopenstaxorg
