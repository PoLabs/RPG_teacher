withstands compression

Cell Types in Bones
Bone consists of four types of cells osteoblasts osteoclasts osteocytes and osteoprogenitor cells
Osteoblasts are bone cells that are responsible for bone formation Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the
organic part and inorganic part of the extracellular matrix of bone tissue and collagen fibers Osteoblasts
become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active osteocytes Osteoclasts are large bone
cells with up to 50 nuclei They remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes and acids that dissolve
the bony matrix These minerals released from bones into the blood help regulate calcium concentrations in
body fluids Bone may also be resorbed for remodeling if the applied stresses have changed Osteocytes
are mature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue these cells cannot divide Osteocytes
maintain normal bone structure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix Osteoprogenitor cells are
squamous stem cells that divide to produce daughter cells that differentiate into osteoblasts Osteoprogenitor
cells are important in the repair of fractures
Development of Bone
Ossification or osteogenesis is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts Ossification is distinct from
the process of calcification whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones it can also occur
in other tissues Ossification begins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo Before this time
the embryonic skeleton consists entirely of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage The development of bone
from fibrous membranes is called intramembranous ossification development from hyaline cartilage is called
endochondral ossification Bone growth continues until approximately age 25 Bones can grow in thickness
throughout life but after age 25 ossification functions primarily in bone remodeling and repair
Intramembranous Ossification
Intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes It is involved in
the formation of the flat bones of the skull the mandible and the clavicles Ossification begins as mesenchymal
cells form a template of the future bone They then differentiate into osteoblasts at the ossification center
