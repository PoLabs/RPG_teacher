UNIT 3 POWER AND CITIZENSHIP

even though they expanded greatly failed in seriously threatening the powers 
that be In France the Ligues on 6 February 1934 violently opposed leftwing 
movements during an antiparliamentary demonstration organised in Paris 
in front of the Chamber of Deputies which turned into a riot and resulted 
in a dozen deaths and several hundred injuries It also led to the fall of the 
Daladier government but the rightwing groups did not manage to take 
power The British Union of Fascists founded by Oswald Mosley in 1932 had 
50000 members in 1934 and around 100000 supporters and reached its peak 
in 1939 Despite significant results in the 1937 London municipal elections the 
party became unpopular in the late 1930s Indeed most of these fascist parties 
declined rapidly after 1936
Between 1939 and 1945 the Nazis conquered most of Europe and protest 
movements went underground Economic plunder propaganda repression 
against adversaries selfdeclared or named by the state and persecution 
against the inferior races all became part of daily life in the occupied countries 
Local governments participated in this subjugation whether willingly or not 
But there were also resistance movements that fought the Nazis inspired 
by the governments that took refuge in London or which spontaneously 
refused German tutelage Beyond the military stakes the Resistance became a 
reflection of popular European will for political and social renewal There was 
nevertheless a divide between communist resistance fighters on the one hand 
and on the other a more reformist resistance aligned with the restoration of 
traditional institutions and societies In the postwar period this opposition 
erupted in broad daylight as in Greece where it led to civil war
Protest Movements in Southern European Authoritarian 
Contexts after 1945
The post1945 condition in the European South was characterised by political 
violence and its aftereffects Civil wars and their aftermath longrunning 
authoritarian regimes and disciplined democracies gave way to waves 
of discontent which started being expressed in the 1950s In Greece the 
repressive political system that followed the Civil War of the 1940s reached 
its climax in 1967 with the Colonels putsch while in Spain and Portugal 
the autocratic rule of Francisco Franco 18921975 and Antnio de Oliveira 
Salazar 18891970 remained virtually unchallenged from the late 1930s and 
mid1920s respectively These conflicts were followed by systems of political 
and social exclusion for leftwingers and waves of political and later on 
economic refugees flooded Western and to some extent Eastern Europe The 
Portuguese Spanish and Greek Communist Parties remained outlawed up 
until the 1970s
