Figure 2843 Crustacean anatomy The crayfish is an example of a crustacean It has a carapace around the
cephalothorax and the heart in the dorsal thorax area credit Jane Whitney
As in the chelicerates most crustaceans are dioecious However some species like barnacles may be
hermaphrodites Serial hermaphroditism where the gonad can switch from producing sperm to ova is also
exhibited in some species Fertilized eggs may be held within the female of the species or may be released in
the water Terrestrial crustaceans seek out damp spaces in their habitats to lay eggs
Larval stagesnauplius or zoeaare seen in the early development of aquatic crustaceans A cypris larva is
also seen in the early development of barnacles Figure 2844

Crustaceans possess a brain formed by the fusion of the first three segmental ganglia as well as two
compound eyes A ventral nerve cord connects additional segmental ganglia Most crustaceans are carnivorous
but herbivorous and detritivorous species and even endoparasitic species are known A highly evolved
endoparasitic species such as Sacculina spp parasitizes its crab host and ultimately destroys it after it forces
the host to incubate the parasites eggs Crustaceans may also be cannibalistic when extremely high populations
of these organisms are present
Subphylum Hexapoda
The insects comprise the largest class of arthropods in terms of species diversity as well as in terms of
biomassat least in terrestrial habitats
The name Hexapoda describes the presence of six legs three pairs in these animals which differentiates them
from other groups of arthropods that have different numbers of legs In some cases however the number of
legs has been evolutionarily reduced or the legs have been highly modified to accommodate specific conditions
such as endoparasitism Hexapod bodies are organized into three tagmata head thorax and abdomen
Individual segments of the head have mouthparts derived from jointed legs and the thorax has three pairs of
jointed appendages and also wings in most derived groups For example in the pterygotes winged insects
in addition to a pair of jointed legs on all three segments comprising the thorax prothorax mesothorax and
metathorax
Appendages found on other body segments are also evolutionarily derived from modified legs Typically the
