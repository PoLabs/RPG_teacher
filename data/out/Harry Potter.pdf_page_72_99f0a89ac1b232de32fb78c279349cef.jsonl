What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten
Harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it  but just as
the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large
crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last
backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished
Fred you next the plump woman said
Im not Fred Im George said the boy Honestly woman you call
yourself our mother CarA you tell Im George
Sorry George dear
Only joking I am Fred said the boy and off he went His twin called
after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later
he had gone  but how had he done it
Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was
almost there  and then quite suddenly he wasnt anywhere
There was nothing else for it
Excuse me Harry said to the plump woman
Hello dear she said First time at Hogwarts Rons new too
She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons He was tall thin and
gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose
Yes said Harry The thing is  the thing is I dont know how to

How to get onto the platform she said kindly and Harry nodded
Not to worry she said All you have to do is walk straight at the
barrier between platforms nine and ten Dont stop and dont be scared
youll crash into it thats very important Best do it at a bit of a
run if youre nervous Go on go now before Ron
Er  okay said Harry
