would rather old Smaug had been left with all the wretched treasure than that
these vile creatures should get it and poor old Bombur and Balin and Fili and
Kili and all the rest come to a bad end and Bard too and the Lakemen and the
merry elves Misery me I have heard songs of many battles and I have always
understood that defeat may be glorious It seems very uncomfortable not to say
distressing I wish I was well out of it
The clouds were torn by the wind and a red sunset slashed the West Seeing
the sudden gleam in the gloom Bilbo looked round He gave a great cry he had
seen a sight that made his heart leap dark shapes small yet majestic against the
distant glow
The Eagles The Eagles he shouted The Eagles are coming
Bilbos eyes were seldom wrong The eagles were coming down the wind
line after line in such a host as must have gathered from all the eyries of the
North
The Eagles the Eagles Bilbo cried dancing and waving his arms If the
elves could not see him they could hear him Soon they too took up the cry and
it echoed across the valley Many wondering eyes looked up though as yet
nothing could be seen except from the southern shoulders of the Mountain
The Eagles cried Bilbo once more but at that moment a stone hurtling
from above smote heavily on his helm and he fell with a crash and knew no
more
