Figure 126 Alkaptonuria is a recessive genetic disorder in which two amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine
are not properly metabolized Affected individuals may have darkened skin and brown urine and may suffer joint
damage and other complications In this pedigree individuals with the disorder are indicated in blue and have the
genotype aa Unaffected individuals are indicated in yellow and have the genotype AA or Aa Note that it is often
possible to determine a persons genotype from the genotype of their offspring For example if neither parent has
the disorder but their child does they must be heterozygous Two individuals on the pedigree have an unaffected
phenotype but unknown genotype Because they do not have the disorder they must have at least one normal
allele so their genotype gets the A designation
What are the genotypes of the individuals labeled 1 2 and 3
Alternatives to Dominance and Recessiveness
Mendels experiments with pea plants suggested that 1 two units or alleles exist for every gene 2 alleles
maintain their integrity in each generation no blending and 3 in the presence of the dominant allele
the recessive allele is hidden and makes no contribution to the phenotype Therefore recessive alleles can
be carried and not expressed by individuals Such heterozygous individuals are sometimes referred to as
carriers Further genetic studies in other plants and animals have shown that much more complexity exists
but that the fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics still hold true In the sections to follow we consider
some of the extensions of Mendelism If Mendel had chosen an experimental system that exhibited these genetic
complexities its possible that he would not have understood what his results meant
Incomplete Dominance
Mendels results that traits are inherited as dominant and recessive pairs contradicted the view at that time
that offspring exhibited a blend of their parents traits However the heterozygote phenotype occasionally does
appear to be intermediate between the two parents For example in the snapdragon Antirrhinum majus Figure
127 a cross between a homozygous parent with white flowers CWCW and a homozygous parent with red
flowers CRCR will produce offspring with pink flowers CRCW Note that different genotypic abbreviations are
used for Mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness This
pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance denoting the expression of two contrasting alleles
such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype The allele for red flowers is incompletely dominant
over the allele for white flowers However the results of a heterozygote selfcross can still be predicted just as
with Mendelian dominant and recessive crosses In this case the genotypic ratio would be 1 CRCR2 CRCW1
CWCW and the phenotypic ratio would be 121 for redpinkwhite
