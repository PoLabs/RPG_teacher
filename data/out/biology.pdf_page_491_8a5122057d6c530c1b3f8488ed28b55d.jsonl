Microbial Genomics Creation of New Biofuels
Knowledge of the genomics of microorganisms is being used to find better ways to harness biofuels from
algae and cyanobacteria The primary sources of fuel today are coal oil wood and other plant products such
as ethanol Although plants are renewable resources there is still a need to find more alternative renewable
sources of energy to meet our populations energy demands The microbial world is one of the largest resources
for genes that encode new enzymes and produce new organic compounds and it remains largely untapped
Microorganisms are used to create products such as enzymes that are used in research antibiotics and other
antimicrobial mechanisms Microbial genomics is helping to develop diagnostic tools improved vaccines new
disease treatments and advanced environmental cleanup techniques
Mitochondrial Genomics
Mitochondria are intracellular organelles that contain their own DNA Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a rapid
rate and scientists often use it to study evolutionary relationships Another feature that makes studying the
mitochondrial genome interesting is that the mitochondrial DNA in most multicellular organisms passes from
the mother during the fertilization process For this reason scientists often use mitochondrial genomics to trace
genealogy
Experts have used information and clues from DNA samples at crime scenes as evidence in court cases and
they have used genetic markers in forensic analysis Genomic analysis has also become useful in this field The
first publication showcasing the first use of genomics in forensics came out in 2001 It was a collaborative attempt
between academic research institutions and the FBI to solve the mysterious cases of anthrax communicated
via the US Postal Service Using microbial genomics researchers determined that the culprit used a specific
anthrax strain in all the mailings
Genomics in Agriculture
Genomics can reduce the trials and failures involved in scientific research to a certain extent which could
improve agricultural crop yield quality and quantity Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps improve crop
breeding to generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable
traits and then transfer those traits to a different organism Researchers are discovering how genomics can
improve agricultural productions quality and quantity For example scientists could use desirable traits to create
