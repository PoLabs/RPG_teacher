In any case the nineteenth century witnessed intense processes of nation 
and statebuilding all around Europe propelled by political cultural and 
economic developments This included the crystallisation into liberal states 
of old or restored monarchies such as the United Kingdom France or 
Spain each one affected in different ways by revolutionary events These 
were nations characterised by internal ethnic diversity that found ways to 
homogenise around a language identified with the state English French and 
Castilian This cultural diversity was the basis for the development of non
state regionalisms and nationalisms by the end of the century like those of 
Wales Scotland the Basque Country or Catalonia 
Other states appeared as the consequence of complex processes of unification 
between areas that were previously defined along cultural linguistic or

distinction from Germany their powerful and newly unified neighbour

ethnic differentiation This was directly connected to the longrunning crisis

especially Russia AustriaHungary and later Germany Greece was the first 
to obtain its independence after a long war 18211830 Serbians Romanians
