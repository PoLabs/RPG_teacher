he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he
didnt approve of imagination
As he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw 
and it didnt improve his mood  was the tabby cat hed spotted that
morning It was now sitting on his garden wall He was sure it was the
same one it had the same markings around its eyes
Shoo said Mr Dursley loudly The cat didnt move It just gave him a
stern look Was this normal cat behavior Mr Dursley wondered Trying
to pull himself together he let himself into the house He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife
Mrs Dursley had had a nice normal day She told him over dinner all
about Mrs Next Doors problems with her daughter and how Dudley had
learned a new word Wont Mr Dursley tried to act normally When
Dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to
catch the last report on the evening news
And finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations
owls have been behaving very unusually today Although owls normally
hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been
hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since
sunrise Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly
changed their sleeping pattern The newscaster allowed himself a grin
Most mysterious And now over to Jim McGuffin with the weather Going
to be any more showers of owls tonight Jim
Well Ted said the weatherman I dont know about that but its not
only the owls that have been acting oddly today Viewers as far apart as
Kent Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead
of the rain I promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting
stars Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early  its
not until next week folks But I can promise a wet night tonight
Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair Shooting stars all over Britain
Owls flying by daylight Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place
And a whisper a whisper about the Potters
Mrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea It was
no good Hed have to say something to her He cleared his throat
nervously Er  Petunia dear  you havent heard from your sister
lately have you
