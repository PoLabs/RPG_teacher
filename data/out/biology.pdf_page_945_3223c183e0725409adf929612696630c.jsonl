Figure 3037 Sucrose is actively transported from source cells into companion cells and then into the sievetube
elements This reduces the water potential which causes water to enter the phloem from the xylem The resulting
positive pressure forces the sucrosewater mixture down toward the roots where sucrose is unloaded Transpiration
causes water to return to the leaves through the xylem vessels
306  Plant Sensory Systems and Responses
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how red and blue light affect plant growth and metabolic activities

Discuss gravitropism

Understand how hormones affect plant growth and development

Describe thigmotropism thigmonastism and thigmogenesis

Explain how plants defend themselves from predators and respond to wounds
Animals can respond to environmental factors by moving to a new location Plants however are rooted in place
and must respond to the surrounding environmental factors Plants have sophisticated systems to detect and
respond to light gravity temperature and physical touch Receptors sense environmental factors and relay
the information to effector systemsoften through intermediate chemical messengersto bring about plant
responses
Plant Responses to Light
Plants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to photosynthesize low
molecularweight sugars using only carbon dioxide light and water Photomorphogenesis is the growth
and development of plants in response to light It allows plants to optimize their use of light and space
Photoperiodism is the ability to use light to track time Plants can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing
and using various wavelengths of sunlight Phototropism is a directional response that allows plants to grow
towards or even away from light
The sensing of light in the environment is important to plants it can be crucial for competition and survival The
response of plants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors which are comprised of a protein covalently
bonded to a lightabsorbing pigment called a chromophore Together the two are called a chromoprotein
