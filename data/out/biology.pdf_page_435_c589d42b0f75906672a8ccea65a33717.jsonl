Figure 1515 A peptide bond links the carboxyl end of one amino acid with the amino end of another producing one
water molecule during the process For simplicity in this image only the functional groups involved in the peptide bond
are shown The R and R designations refer to the rest of each amino acid structure
The Protein Synthesis Machinery
In addition to the mRNA template many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation
The composition of each component may vary across species for example ribosomes may consist of different
numbers of rRNAs and polypeptides depending on the organism However the general structures and functions
of the protein synthesis machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells Translation requires the input
of an mRNA template ribosomes tRNAs and various enzymatic factors Note A ribosome can be thought of
as an enzyme whose amino acid binding sites are specified by mRNA

Ribosomes
Even before an mRNA is translated a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes In E coli there
are between 10000 and 70000 ribosomes present in each cell at any given time A ribosome is a complex
macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs and many distinct polypeptides In eukaryotes the
nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis and assembly of rRNAs
Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum of
eukaryotes Mitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma which look
more similar to prokaryotic ribosomes and have similar drug sensitivities than the ribosomes just outside their
outer membranes in the cytoplasm Ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not
synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the initiation of translation In E coli the small subunit is described
as 30S and the large subunit is 50S for a total of 70S recall that Svedberg units are not additive Mammalian
ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit for a total of 80S The small subunit is responsible
for binding the mRNA template whereas the large subunit sequentially binds tRNAs Each mRNA molecule is
simultaneously translated by many ribosomes all synthesizing protein in the same direction reading the mRNA
from 5 to 3 and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus The complete mRNApoly
ribosome structure is called a polysome
tRNAs
The tRNAs are structural RNA molecules that were transcribed from genes by RNA polymerase III Depending
on the species 40 to 60 types of tRNAs exist in the cytoplasm Transfer RNAs serve as adaptor molecules
Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid and recognizes one or more of the mRNA codons that define the order
of amino acids in a protein AminoacyltRNAs bind to the ribosome and add the corresponding amino acid to
