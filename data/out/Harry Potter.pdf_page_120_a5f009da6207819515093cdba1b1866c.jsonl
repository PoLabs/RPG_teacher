Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except
for Peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard
Out Peeves she barked Peeves threw the chalk into a bin which
clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing Professor McGonagall slammed
the door behind him and turned to face the two boys
Potter this is Oliver Wood Wood  Ive found you a Seeker
Woods expression changed from puzzlement to delight
Are you serious Professor
Absolutely said Professor McGonagall crisply The boys a natural
Ive never seen anything like it Was that your first time on a
broomstick Potter
Harry nodded silently He didnt have a clue what was going on but he
didnt seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming
back to his legs
He caught that thing in his hand after a fiftyfoot dive Professor
McGonagall told Wood Didnt even scratch himself Charlie Weasley
couldnt have done it
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once
Ever seen a game of Quidditch Potter he asked excitedly
Woods captain of the Gryffindor team Professor McGonagall explained
Hes just the build for a Seeker too said Wood now walking around
Harry and staring at him Light  speedy  well have to get him a
decent broom Professor  a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven
Id say
I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we cant bend the
firstyear rule Heaven knows we need a better team than last year
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin I couldnt look Severus Snape
in the face for weeks
