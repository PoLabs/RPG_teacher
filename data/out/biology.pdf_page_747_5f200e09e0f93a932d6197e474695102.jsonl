Building Phylogenetic Trees with Analysis of DNA Sequence
Alignments
All living organisms display patterns of relationships derived from their evolutionary history Phylogeny is the
science that describes the relative connections between organisms in terms of ancestral and descendant
species Phylogenetic trees such as the plant evolutionary history shown in Figure 267 are treelike
branching diagrams that depict these relationships Species are found at the tips of the branches Each
branching point called a node is the point at which a single taxonomic group taxon such as a species
separates into two or more species
Figure 267 Plant phylogeny This phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationships of plants
Phylogenetic trees have been built to describe the relationships between species since the first sketch of
a tree that appeared in Darwins Origin of Species Traditional methods involve comparison of homologous
anatomical structures and embryonic development assuming that closely related organisms share
anatomical features that emerge during embryo development Some traits that disappear in the adult are
present in the embryo for example an early human embryo has a postanal tail as do all members of
the Phylum Chordata The study of fossil records shows the intermediate stages that link an ancestral
form to its descendants However many of the approaches to classification based on the fossil record
alone are imprecise and lend themselves to multiple interpretations As the tools of molecular biology
and computational analysis have been developed and perfected in recent years a new generation of
treebuilding methods has taken shape The key assumption is that genes for essential proteins or RNA
structures such as the ribosomal RNAs are inherently conserved because mutations changes in the DNA
sequence could possibly compromise the survival of the organism DNA from minute samples of living
organisms or fossils can be amplified by polymerase chain reaction PCR and sequenced targeting the
regions of the genome that are most likely to be conserved between species The genes encoding the 18S
ribosomal RNA from the small subunit and plastid genes are frequently chosen for DNA alignment analysis
Once the sequences of interest are obtained they are compared with existing sequences in databases
