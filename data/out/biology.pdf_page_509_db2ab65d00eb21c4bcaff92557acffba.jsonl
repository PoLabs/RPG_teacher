Misconceptions of Evolution
Although the theory of evolution generated some controversy when Darwin first proposed it biologists almost
universally accepted it particularly younger biologists within 20 years after publication of On the Origin of
Species Nevertheless the theory of evolution is a difficult concept and misconceptions about how it works
abound
This site httpopenstaxcollegeorglmisconceptions addresses some of the main misconceptions
associated with the theory of evolution
Evolution Is Just a Theory
Critics of the theory of evolution dismiss its importance by purposefully confounding the everyday usage of
the word theory with the way scientists use the word In science we understand a theory to be a body of
thoroughly tested and verified explanations for a set of observations of the natural world Scientists have a theory
of the atom a theory of gravity and the theory of relativity each which describes understood facts about the
world In the same way the theory of evolution describes facts about the living world As such a theory in science
has survived significant efforts to discredit it by scientists In contrast a theory in common vernacular is a word
meaning a guess or suggested explanation This meaning is more akin to the scientific concept of hypothesis
When critics of evolution say it is just a theory they are implying that there is little evidence supporting it and
that it is still in the process of rigorous testing This is a mischaracterization
Individuals Evolve
Evolution is the change in a populations genetic composition over time specifically over generations resulting
from differential reproduction of individuals with certain alleles Individuals do change over their lifetime
obviously but this is development and involves changes programmed by the set of genes the individual acquired
at birth in coordination with the individuals environment When thinking about the evolution of a characteristic it
is probably best to think about the change of the average value of the characteristic in the population over time
For example when natural selection leads to billsize change in medium ground finches in the Galpagos this
does not mean that individual bills on the finches are changing If one measures the average bill size among
all individuals in the population at one time and then measures them in the population several years later this
average value will be different as a result of evolution Although some individuals may survive from the first time
to the second they will still have the same bill size however there will be many new individuals who contribute
to the shift in average bill size
Evolution Explains the Origin of Life
It is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of lifes origins Conversely some of the
theorys critics believe that it cannot explain the origin of life The theory does not try to explain the origin of life
The theory of evolution explains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species
It does not shed light on the beginnings of life including the origins of the first cells which define life Importantly
biologists believe that the presence of life on Earth precludes the possibility that the events that led to life on
Earth can repeat themselves because the intermediate stages would immediately become food for existing living
things
However once a mechanism of inheritance was in place in the form of a molecule like DNA either within a cell
or precell these entities would be subject to the principle of natural selection More effective reproducers would
increase in frequency at the expense of inefficient reproducers While evolution does not explain the origin of life
it may have something to say about some of the processes operating once preliving entities acquired certain
properties
Organisms Evolve on Purpose
Statements such as organisms evolve in response to a change in an environment are quite common but
such statements can lead to two types of misunderstandings First do not interpret the statement to mean that
