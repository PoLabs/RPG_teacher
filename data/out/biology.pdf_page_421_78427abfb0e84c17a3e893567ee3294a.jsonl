The specification of a single amino acid by multiple similar codons is called degeneracy Degeneracy is
believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations Codons that specify
the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide In addition amino acids with chemically similar side
chains are encoded by similar codons For example aspartate Asp and glutamate Glu which occupy the GA
block are both negatively charged This nuance of the genetic code ensures that a singlenucleotide substitution
mutation might specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid preventing the
protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional
The genetic code is nearly universal With a few minor exceptions virtually all species use the same genetic
code for protein synthesis Conservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in
horses could be transferred to a tulip cell and the tulip would synthesize horse globin That there is only one
genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on Earth shares a common origin especially considering that
there are about 1084 possible combinations of 20 amino acids and 64 triplet codons

message creating a nonfunctional protein or terminating protein synthesis altogether
