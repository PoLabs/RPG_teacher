was no good giving up their quest yet Nor could they get away just now as
Thorin had pointed out Their ponies were lost or killed and they would have to
wait some time before Smaug relaxed his watch sufficiently for them to dare the
long way on foot Luckily they had saved enough of their stores to last them still
for some time
They debated long on what was to be done but they could think of no way of
getting rid of Smaugwhich had always been a weak point in their plans as
Bilbo felt inclined to point out Then as is the nature of folk that are thoroughly
perplexed they began to grumble at the hobbit blaming him for what had at first
so pleased them for bringing away a cup and stirring up Smaugs wrath so soon
What else do you suppose a burglar is to do asked Bilbo angrily I was
not engaged to kill dragons that is warriors work but to steal treasure I made
the best beginning I could Did you expect me to trot back with the whole hoard
of Thror on my back If there is any grumbling to be done I think I might have a

Never mind that for the moment What are we to do now today
Well if you really want my advice I should say we can do nothing but stay
where we are By day we can no doubt creep out safely enough to take the air
Perhaps before long one or two could be chosen to go back to the store by the
river and replenish our supplies But in the meanwhile everyone ought to be well
inside the tunnel by night
Now I will make you an offer I have got my ring and will creep down this
very noonthen if ever Smaug ought to be nappingand see what he is up to
Perhaps something will turn up Every worm has his weak spot as my father
used to say though I am sure it was not from personal experience
Naturally the dwarves accepted the offer eagerly Already they had come to
respect little Bilbo Now he had become the real leader in their adventure He
