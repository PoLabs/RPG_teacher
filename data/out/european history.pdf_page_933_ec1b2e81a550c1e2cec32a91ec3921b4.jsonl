of Leisure
In the twentieth century debates about the regulation of time raised the 
possibility of providing people with a few weeks of time off work and paid 
holidays were legally regulated in various European countries The right 
to holidays was officially endorsed by the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights Article 24 adopted by the United Nations in 1948 and consequently 
mass tourism became a reality in Europe However the question did not end 
with simply granting holidays to people governments and philanthropic 
movements undertook measures to supervise the masses of people now 
accessing leisure For instance it was the desire to provide healthy supervised 
leisure activities for young workers that gave rise to youth hostels in Germany 
at the turn of the century 
In the 1960s there was a massification of access to holidays growth in the 
tourism industry and the establishment of leisure mobility as a social norm 
This led to a collective and individual increase in tourist consumption which 
is reflected in the high share of leisure and holiday expenditure in household 
budgets These changes brought about a transformation in transport which 
redrew the map of European tourism Individual cars and highways and planes

in air travel which became increasingly accessible for more and more people 
The opening of Malaga Airport in 1968 accelerated the urbanisation of the 
Costa del Sol thanks to charter flights In addition from the 1990s onwards 
the appearance of lowcost flights further amplified this dynamic to include 
other parts of Eastern Europe such as the Dalmatian Coast
The development of tourism as a mass phenomenon was finally made 
possible and supervised by major development projects that changed the 
scale of leisure infrastructures La GrandeMotte beach resort on the French 
Mediterranean Coast is an example of these logics between the promotion 
of a social ideology and regional planning In contrast to the uncontrolled 
development of tourist urbanisation on the Cte dAzur the French 
government wanted to take advantage of the desire for holidays to redevelop 
the Languedoc coastline In the 1960s the French government cleaned up 
the mosquitoinfested swamps that lined the beaches and built large resorts 
capable of absorbing tourist flows revitalising the regional economy and
