of the bacterial cell do you think antibiotics target
Why
31 Explain why not all microbes are harmful
32 You already know that ribosomes are abundant in
red blood cells In what other cells of the body would
you find them in great abundance Why
33 What are the structural and functional similarities
and differences between mitochondria and
chloroplasts
34 Why are plasma membranes arranged as a
bilayer rather than a monolayer
35 In the context of cell biology what do we mean by
form follows function What are at least two
examples of this concept
36 In your opinion is the nuclear membrane part of
the endomembrane system Why or why not
Defend your answer
37 What are the similarities and differences between
the structures of centrioles and flagella
38 How do cilia and flagella differ
39 Describe how microfilaments and microtubules
are involved in the phagocytosis and destruction of a
pathogen by a macrophage
40 Compare and contrast the boundaries that plant
animal and bacteria cells use to separate
themselves from their surrounding environment
41 How does the structure of a plasmodesma differ
from that of a gap junction
42 Explain how the extracellular matrix functions
43 Pathogenic E coli have recently been shown to
degrade tight junction proteins during infection How
would this provide an advantage to the bacteria
