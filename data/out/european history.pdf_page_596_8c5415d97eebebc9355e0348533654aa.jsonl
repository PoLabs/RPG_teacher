turn formed the nucleus of entirely new industries While the first phase of 
industrialisation was largely dominated by coal and steel later innovations 
enabled the emergence of the electrical industry the chemical industry the 
automotive industry and much else 
What exactly caused industrialisation in nineteenthcentury Europe and 
only in parts of Europe remains an open question in the scholarly debate 
What is evident is that these processes allowed for European imperial 
powers to forge ahead and turn economic progress into political clout and 
military strength with consequences that would become fully apparent in the 
disastrous conflicts from the end of the long nineteenth century and the first 
wars of the industrial era
Types of Economic Actor
The economic transformations of the nineteenth century were led by the 
family business while the modern corporation did not develop institutionally 
until well into the century Excepting banks and railways most economic 
initiatives were organised under individual and familial partnerships These 
early associations resulted from groups of individuals that pooled capital 
and thus the degree of responsibility of each over the sums of money being 
utilised needed to be clearly defined Such legally binding obligations are 
called liabilities early individual and familial partnerships relied upon 
collective partnerships with unlimited liability This meant that the individuals 
engaging in business activity were personally liable for loans The high levels 
of risk which resulted from this unlimited liability as well as poor legal and 
institutional development explain the prevalence of familial and ethnic ties 
behind partnerships Such connections provided the basis for relationships of 
trust and were still the main source of human and money capital in order to find 
new employees or finance The family business whose partners were linked 
by kinship and whose priority was to accumulate and control property thus 
took charge of all spheres of economic activity such as trade transportation 
insurance and credit relying upon underdeveloped management systems
The unlimited liability of collective partnerships gradually gave way to 
other methods which limited the liability of each partner to hisher invested 
capital thus allowing the mobilisation of greater amounts of capital Large 
quantities of capital had already been mobilised by the chartered companies 
of the early modern period by which the monarchies expanded trade and 
colonial interests in the extraEuropean world However chartered companies 
required political sanction usually in the form of royal charters The new 
publiclyheld corporation was developed free of such government sanction 
and could thus be established by general incorporation and public registration
