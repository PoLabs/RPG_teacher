Hermione ran to turn him over Nevilles jaws were jammed together so he
couldnt speak Only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror
Whatve you done to him Harry whispered
Its the full BodyBind said Hermione miserably Oh Neville Im so
sorry
We had to Neville no time to explain said Harry
Youll understand later Neville said Ron as they stepped over him
and pulled on the invisibility cloak
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a
very good omen In their nervous state every statues shadow looked
like Filch every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping
down on them At the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted Mrs
Norris skulking near the top
Oh lets kick her just this once Ron whispered in Harrys ear but
Harry shook his head As they climbed carefully around her Mrs Norris
turned her lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anything
They didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the
third floor Peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that
people would trip
Whos there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him He narrowed
his wicked black eyes Know youre there even if I cant see you Are
you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie
He rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them
Should call Filch I should if somethings acreeping around unseen
Harry had a sudden idea
Peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the Bloody Baron has his own
reasons for being invisible
Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock He caught himself in time
and hovered about a foot off the stairs
