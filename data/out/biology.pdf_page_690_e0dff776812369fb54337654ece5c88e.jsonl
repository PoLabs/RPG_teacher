during the sexual phase In each ascus the four nuclei produced by meiosis divide once mitotically for a total of
eight haploid ascospores The haploid phase is the predominant phase of the life cycle in Ascomycetes
Which of the following statements is true
a
A dikaryotic ascus that forms in the ascocarp undergoes karyogamy meiosis and mitosis to form eight
ascospores
b

c
