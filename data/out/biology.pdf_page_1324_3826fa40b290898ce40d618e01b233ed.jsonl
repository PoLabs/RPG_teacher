Figure 4213 B cell receptors are embedded in the membranes of B cells and bind a variety of antigens through their
variable regions The signal transduction region transfers the signal into the cell
T and B cells differ in one fundamental way whereas T cells bind antigens that have been digested and
embedded in MHC molecules by APCs B cells function as APCs that bind intact antigens that have not been
processed Although T and B cells both react with molecules that are termed antigens these lymphocytes
actually respond to very different types of molecules B cells must be able to bind intact antigens because they
secrete antibodies that must recognize the pathogen directly rather than digested remnants of the pathogen
Bacterial carbohydrate and lipid molecules can activate B cells independently from the T cells
Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes
CTLs a subclass of T cells function to clear infections directly The cellmediated part of the adaptive immune
system consists of CTLs that attack and destroy infected cells CTLs are particularly important in protecting
against viral infections this is because viruses replicate within cells where they are shielded from extracellular
contact with circulating antibodies When APCs phagocytize pathogens and present MHC Iembedded antigens
to nave CD8 T cells that express complementary TCRs the CD8 T cells become activated to proliferate
according to clonal selection These resulting CTLs then identify nonAPCs displaying the same MHC I
embedded antigens for example viral proteinsfor example the CTLs identify infected host cells
Intracellularly infected cells typically die after the infecting pathogen replicates to a sufficient concentration and
lyses the cell as many viruses do CTLs attempt to identify and destroy infected cells before the pathogen
can replicate and escape thereby halting the progression of intracellular infections CTLs also support NK
lymphocytes to destroy early cancers Cytokines secreted by the TH1 response that stimulates macrophages
also stimulate CTLs and enhance their ability to identify and destroy infected cells and tumors
CTLs sense MHC Iembedded antigens by directly interacting with infected cells via their TCRs Binding of TCRs
with antigens activates CTLs to release perforin and granzyme degradative enzymes that will induce apoptosis
of the infected cell Recall that this is a similar destruction mechanism to that used by NK cells In this process
the CTL does not become infected and is not harmed by the secretion of perforin and granzymes In fact the
functions of NK cells and CTLs are complementary and maximize the removal of infected cells as illustrated
in Figure 4214 If the NK cell cannot identify the missing self pattern of downregulated MHC I molecules
then the CTL can identify it by the complex of MHC I with foreign antigens which signals altered self Similarly
if the CTL cannot detect antigenembedded MHC I because the receptors are depleted from the cell surface
NK cells will destroy the cell instead CTLs also emit cytokines such as interferons that alter surface protein
expression in other infected cells such that the infected cells can be easily identified and destroyed Moreover
these interferons can also prevent virally infected cells from releasing virus particles
