143  Basics of DNA Replication
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how the structure of DNA reveals the replication process

Describe the Meselson and Stahl experiments
The elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of
itself In their 1953 paper Watson and Crick penned an incredible understatement It has not escaped our notice
that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic
material With specific base pairs the sequence of one DNA strand can be predicted from its complement
The doublehelix model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication and each
strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied What was not clear was how
the replication took place There were three models suggested Figure 1412 conservative semiconservative
and dispersive
