present Smaug was away from home Each now gripped a lighted torch and as
they gazed first on one side and then on another they forgot fear and even
caution They spoke aloud and cried out to one another as they lifted old
treasures from the mound or from the wall and held them in the light caressing
and fingering them
Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood and finding still hanging there
many golden harps strung with silver they took them and struck them and being
magical and also untouched by the dragon who had small interest in music
they were still in tune The dark hall was filled with a melody that had long been
silent But most of the dwarves were more practical they gathered gems and
stuffed their pockets and let what they could not carry fall back through their
fingers with a sigh Thorin was not least among these but always he searched
from side to side for something which he could not find It was the Arkenstone

set upon the hobbits head
I feel magnificent he thought but I expect I look rather absurd How they

All the same Mr Baggins kept his head more clear of the bewitchment of the
hoard than the dwarves did Long before the dwarves were tired of examining
the treasures he became weary of it and sat down on the floor and he began to
wonder nervously what the end of it all would be I would give a good many of
these precious goblets he thought for a drink of something cheering out of
one of Beorns wooden bowls
Thorin he cried aloud What next We are armed but what good has any
armour ever been before against Smaug the Dreadful This treasure is not yet
won back We are not looking for gold yet but for a way of escape and we have
tempted luck too long
You speak the truth answered Thorin recovering his wits Let us go I
