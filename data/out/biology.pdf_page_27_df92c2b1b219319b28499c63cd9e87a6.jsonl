Two Types of Science Basic Science and Applied Science
The scientific community has been debating for the last few decades about the value of different types of
science Is it valuable to pursue science for the sake of simply gaining knowledge or does scientific knowledge
only have worth if we can apply it to solving a specific problem or to bettering our lives This question focuses
on the differences between two types of science basic science and applied science
Basic science or pure science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the shortterm application of that
knowledge It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value The
immediate goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledges sake although this does not mean that in the
end it may not result in a practical application
In contrast applied science or technology aims to use science to solve realworld problems making it
possible for example to improve a crop yield find a cure for a particular disease or save animals threatened
by a natural disaster Figure 18 In applied science the problem is usually defined for the researcher
Figure 18 After Hurricane Irma struck the Caribbean and Florida in 2017 thousands of baby squirrels like this one
were thrown from their nests Thanks to applied science scientists knew how to rehabilitate the squirrel credit

Some individuals may perceive applied science as useful and basic science as useless A question these
people might pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be What for However a careful
look at the history of science reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications
of great value Many scientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before researchers
develop an application therefore applied science relies on the results that researchers generate through basic
science Other scientists think that it is time to move on from basic science in order to find solutions to actual
problems Both approaches are valid It is true that there are problems that demand immediate attention
however scientists would find few solutions without the help of the wide knowledge foundation that basic science
generates
One example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the
discovery of DNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication
DNA strands unique in every human are in our cells where they provide the instructions necessary for
life When DNA replicates it produces new copies of itself shortly before a cell divides Understanding DNA
replication mechanisms enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that researchers now use to identify
genetic diseases pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene and determine paternity Without basic
science it is unlikely that applied science would exist
Another example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project a study in
which researchers analyzed and mapped each human chromosome to determine the precise sequence of
DNA subunits and each genes exact location The gene is the basic unit of heredity An individuals complete
collection of genes is his or her genome Researchers have studied other less complex organisms as part of this
project in order to gain a better understanding of human chromosomes The Human Genome Project Figure
19 relied on basic research with simple organisms and later with the human genome An important end goal
