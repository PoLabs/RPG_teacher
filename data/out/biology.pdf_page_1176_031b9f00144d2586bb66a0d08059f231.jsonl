Figure 3716 This illustration shows the location of the thyroid gland
The thyroid gland is made up of many spherical thyroid follicles which are lined with a simple cuboidal
epithelium These follicles contain a viscous fluid called colloid which stores the glycoprotein thyroglobulin the
precursor to the thyroid hormones The follicles produce hormones that can be stored in the colloid or released
into the surrounding capillary network for transport to the rest of the body via the circulatory system
Thyroid follicle cells synthesize the hormone thyroxine which is also known as T4 because it contains four atoms
of iodine and triiodothyronine also known as T3 because it contains three atoms of iodine Follicle cells are
stimulated to release stored T3 and T4 by thyroid stimulating hormone TSH which is produced by the anterior
pituitary These thyroid hormones increase the rates of mitochondrial ATP production
A third hormone calcitonin is produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid either releasing hormones or
inhibiting hormones Calcitonin release is not controlled by TSH but instead is released when calcium ion
concentrations in the blood rise Calcitonin functions to help regulate calcium concentrations in body fluids
It acts in the bones to inhibit osteoclast activity and in the kidneys to stimulate excretion of calcium The
combination of these two events lowers body fluid levels of calcium
Parathyroid Glands
Most people have four parathyroid glands however the number can vary from two to six These glands are
located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland as shown in Figure 3717 Normally there is a superior
gland and an inferior gland associated with each of the thyroids two lobes Each parathyroid gland is covered
by connective tissue and contains many secretory cells that are associated with a capillary network
