The collapse of socialist systems in 19891990 led to a complete restructuring 
of their economies After previous full employment the emergence of mass 
and longterm unemployment caused a huge shock After 1989 the flow of 
labour from Eastern Europe to the West was very diverse Many of those 
who moved from the East to the West had solid skills and thus were able to 
receive wellpaid jobs Some of them found positions as executives in newly 
formed enterprises in emerging markets Women from Eastern Europe in 
some cases found employment as sex workers Migrants from the East also 
found themselves caring for the elderly The accession of the former socialist 
countries to the European Union EU has made labour migration from East 
to West a mass phenomenon Forced labour in the form of human trafficking 
as well as new and less organised forms of exploitation of migrant workers in 
the EU can be highlighted at the end of the twentieth century IntraEU labour 
migration has taken on such a scale that some regions and countriestypically 
those in the South and East of the EUprovide the workforce for the service
based industries in the economic centres of the EU There were also special 
regimes negotiated for workers from nonEU countries in order to enable 
large segments of industries and agriculture to profit from their workforce
Since the mid1970s finding countries with cheaper labour became a 
prime target for many European companies and this costcutting strategy 
became a vital element of industrial competitiveness These processes led to 
the deindustrialisation of the West from at least the second half of the 1970s 
and accelerated in the fully globalised economies at the end of the twentieth 
century in the form of offshoring This meant simply closing down sites of 
production typically factories in one part of Europe and moving them either 
within the enlarged EU to countries with lower wages or beyond for instance 
to Turkey Morocco China or Indonesia The automotive industry is an 
illustrative example of this process with many automotive factories closed 
in France and Belgium and reopened in the Czech Republic Romania and 
beyond 
It took the decisionmakers around fifty years to realise that by offshoring 
production and reaching the target of lower labour costs they were 
undercutting the economy in their own countries This is because those who 
were made redundant due to the closure of their workplace could not so easily 
acquire new skills and find an alternative source of income This issue has 
become far more visible lately with the widespread introduction of artificial 
intelligence bots and algorithms
In the present day the rhetoric of free and unfree labour has received 
new momentum Over the past decade there has been a growing pressure 
to replace human labour with artificial intelligence At first this pressure was 
applied to manufacturing and assembly plants to gradually make them more
