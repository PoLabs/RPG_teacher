206 DATA VISUALISATION
Reporting on data and making sure that the information gets to the right users in the right 
way is important Not everyone is adept at understanding a detailed financial breakdown and 
analytics reports often intimidate people which is why it is important to present information 
in a way thats accessible to everyone
Data visualisation involves placing data in a 
visual context to help users understand it It can 
demonstrate patterns and trends that might be 
easily missed in a purely textbased data report 
It can also refer to something as simple as an 
infographic or as complex as a multipoint 
interactive programme that lets users decide 
what to compare 
In the age of Big Data data visualisation is crucial in making sense of the information generated 
every day Good visualisation tells a story by removing the noise and highlighting the useful 
information Tableau nd Effective data visualisation is a delicate balancing act between 
form and function The better you can convey your point visually the better you can leverage 
that information
