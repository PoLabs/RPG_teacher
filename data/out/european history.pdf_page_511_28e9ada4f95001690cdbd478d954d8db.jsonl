of its subjects from the midtwentieth century more comprehensive systems 
were put into place that shaped almost every aspect of human life Another 
strong difference with previous periods was the strong institutionalisation 
and development of elaborate bureaucracies This aggressive involvement of 
the state in poverty reduction education housing and healthcare should be 
seen as a response to the economic depression of the 1930s and the deep social 
problems caused by laissezfaire capitalism
There was also a political dimension to the introduction of the welfare state 
in Europe In an effort to tap into changing values around the redistribution 
of wealth and aiming to coopt communist ideals in the late 1940s and 1950s 
elaborate welfare mechanisms were introduced Drawing on the ideal types 
of sociologist Gsta EspingAnderson three variants of welfare state can be 
discerned 1 liberal welfare states characterised by a minimum involvement 
of the state Britain USA 2 conservative models where the state is especially 
engaged in familybased assistance eg Austria Germany the Netherlands 
etc and 3 social democratic regimes where the state is considerably more 
involved in supporting social life France Belgium Although Esping
Andersons classifications have received some criticism because many 
examples lay at the boundaries of or between these different regimes it is still 
widely used as the main typology in research today Although the countries of 
the Socialist Bloc and the Soviet Union do not fall within the more traditional 
definitions of the welfare state due to their illiberal democratic system east of 
the Iron Curtain elaborate welfare systems based on Marxist ideals were also 
established and even lay at the heart of the raison dtre of these states 
Towards the end of the twentieth century reforms have dramatically 
eroded the welfare systems of countries both east and west of the Iron Curtain 
From the late 1970s and especially the early 1980s neoliberal ideas at that 
time promoted in the US and UK increasingly entered the political discourse 
in the democracies of continental Europe Liberal parties inspired by Reagan 
and Thatcher explicitly questioned the dominance of the state in especially 
economic affairs and advocated for a greater freedom for the individual 
By the 1990s the logic of the market would stand central and welfare 
programs and subsidisation policies would receive scrutiny eg government 
involvement in key industries boosting employment such as coal mining 
Many programmes were phased out for ideological reasons but an underlying 
economic imperative also contributed to the disappearance of elaborate 
welfare programmes Globalisation had been creating a race to the bottom 
especially in industry Tax incomes of states decreased while states needed to 
cut taxes for large companies to deter them from moving their production to 
lowincome countries with a more favourable tax system The pervasive logic 
of the market also impacted social democratic parties ie social democrats
