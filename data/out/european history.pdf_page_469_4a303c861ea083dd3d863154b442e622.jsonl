chemistry and its huge impact on agriculture fertilisers and industry dyes 
or the worldshattering theory of evolution that made the millenarian notion 
of divine creation hard to sustain on anything other than a symbolic level 
Science and technology were deemed useful by governments in Europe and 
beyond and they proved ready to invest in them driven by military but also 
administrative and economic concerns The speed of these changes and their 
place in the more general Weltanschauung of the progress of civilisation led 
to a proliferation of narratives and projects of a better future in which science 
and technology played an important role Scientific utopias did not convince 
everyone and in parallel anxieties emerged over the corrupting effects of 
new technologies and the consequences of replacing a religious worldview 
with a scientific one The hopes deposited in the sciences and technologies as 
tools of social change were accompanied by dystopian visions of madness 
dehumanisation and annihilation For the most part though explanations 
and practices based on scientific knowledge acquired weight in justifying new 
legislation and in legitimising political action by both governments and by 
subversive movements They became more and more present in public debate 
and even in the private lives of women and men in Europe and beyond Science 
and technology often served to showcase European superiority and legitimise 
imperialist intervention and domination But because they were understood 
as universal they were often welcomed and creatively appropriated by people 
in different parts of the world who saw science and technology as part of a 
process of regeneration that would save them from perishing under the boot 
of foreigners By the end of the nineteenth century sciences and technologies 
had become weapons in both the material and symbolic realms
