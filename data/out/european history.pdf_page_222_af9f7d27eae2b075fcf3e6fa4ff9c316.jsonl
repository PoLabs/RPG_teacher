differences It is in any case important to differentiate between rural and 
urban settings and between the conditions of high nobility and peasants 
Furthermore the distinction between family and household also differs 
between contexts Sometimes all individuals living together in domestic groups 
will be related by blood but in other situations there may be many additions to 
the basic domestic unit in the form of lodgers servants apprentices and so on 
Historians have tended to find it easier to research domestic residential groups 
ie households than kinship networks 
The structure of this chapter follows that of the life course running from 
birth including infanticide children and childhood marriage households 
and servants to old age and death including inheritance regimes Finally 
we will focus on how early modern houses were furnished and on the role of 
property during ones lifetime and after ones death
Childbirth and Childhood
Childbirth and childhood were highly risky periods for those born in the early 
modern period But during this period important changes also took place 
in how both were dealt with and both topics have stimulated wideranging 
research on various subjects associated with infancy The focus on birth has 
allowed social historians especially since the 1970s to reconstruct the particular 
position that women occupied in early modern families to question the role 
of legitimacy and how transmission of heritage was managed Investigations 
of the history of childbirth have also given us insight into the anatomical and 
medical knowledge of the period In this context religious dimensions proved 
to be very important the questions of when a foetus was actually alive and 
the fate of children who died unbaptised occupied contemporaries intensely 
Early modern mortality rates for mothers and newborns were extremely 
high with roughly twentyseven precent of infants not living to see their first 
birthday and about half didnt make it to adulthood and four to five births 
out of every thousand leading to the death of the mother Taking into account 
that mothers in this period were likely to have multiple children the risk for 
any given mother was therefore much higher Thus births were accompanied 
by religious and magical rituals by which contemporaries hoped to achieve 
a fortuitous birth Once the child was born efforts were made to baptise it as 
quickly as possible in order to integrate it into the community of believers
Throughout the early modern period children were born at home with the 
help of midwives who mostly passed on their knowledge orally We know 
of the practices that characterised midwifery thanks to the regulations of 
territorial authorities but also through some medical literatureEucharius
