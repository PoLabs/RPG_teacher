museums bolstered urban pride and local identity and in some casessuch 
as the Prague City Museum founded in 1883underpinned claims for the 
historical importance of wouldbe capitals But they also stored remnants of 
the vanishing urban landscapes with some of them developing in part as 
a response to the massive destruction of the historical city centrelike the 
Muse Carnavalet in Paris which was created in the wake of the renovation of 
Paris under the French official GeorgesEugne Haussmann 18091891
Heritage and Memory in Public Spaces
Until the late nineteenth century schooling only played a relatively small 
part in disseminating a nations history novels pictures historical paintings 
architecture and theatre were more prominent channels for creating a sense of 
nationhood To reinforce the historical perception of the nation the nineteenth 
century saw the creation of commemorative rituals to bind the national 
community together and to propagate a national history for the population as 
a whole
Maurice Agulhon has described the years 18701940 as being statue 
obsessedduring this period European cities created numerous sites for 
public remembrance But such memorialisation was not merely expressed 
through statues Memory took hold of public space in many different forms 
with commemorative plaques street names pantheons cemeteries and more 
In many ways this enabled the deployment of a tangible and concrete applied 
history and is indicative of the mania for history which intensified in the late 
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
It was in the 1860s that remembrance initiatives grew in scale developing a 
new political ritual which was initially restricted to the ranks of the elite The 
nationalisation of the masses became a conscious programme to rewrite history 
through the evocative names of famous battles and great men In Barcelona 
for example Vctor Balaguer 18241901a Romantic intellectualset about 
naming the streets in the new Ensanche districts of the expanding city He chose 
to follow a logical progression telling the history of Catalonia in Spain taking 
inspiration from a book he had written the History of Catalonia and of the Crown 
of Aragon 1863 Like his contemporaries he thought that Catalonia was a 
prototypical land of freedom as demonstrated by its anticentralist tendencies 
Catalonia thus acted as a guide for Spanish liberalism and placed itself at the 
head of Spains nationalising agenda Thus in the street names of Barcelona 
alongside the great men of the seventeenthcentury anticentralist resistance 
movements Balaguer included the names of battles against Napoleon which 
in his mind symbolised the birth of the Spanish nation
