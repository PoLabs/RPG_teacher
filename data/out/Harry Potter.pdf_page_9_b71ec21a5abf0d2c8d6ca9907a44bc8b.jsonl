Dumbledore told her it was true Dumbledore however was choosing
another lemon drop and did not answer
What theyre saying she pressed on is that last night Voldemort
turned up in Godrics Hollow He went to find the Potters The rumor is
that Lily and James Potter are  are  that theyre  dead 
Dumbledore bowed his head Professor McGonagall gasped
Lily and James I cant believe it I didnt want to believe it
Oh Albus
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder I know I
know he said heavily
Professor McGonagalls voice trembled as she went on Thats not all
Theyre saying he tried to kill the Potters son Harry But  he
couldnt He couldnt kill that little boy No one knows why or how
but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill Harry Potter Voldemorts
power somehow broke  and thats why hes gone
Dumbledore nodded glumly
Its  its true faltered Professor McGonagall After all hes
done all the people hes killed he couldnt kill a little boy
Its just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the
name of heaven did Harry survive
We can only guess said Dumbledore We may never know
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her
eyes beneath her spectacles Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a
golden watch from his pocket and examined it It was a very odd watch
It had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving
around the edge It must have made sense to Dumbledore though because
he put it back in his pocket and said Hagrids late I suppose it was
he who told you Id be here by the way
Yes said Professor McGonagall And I dont suppose youre going to
tell me why youre here of all places
Ive come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle Theyre the only family
he has left now
