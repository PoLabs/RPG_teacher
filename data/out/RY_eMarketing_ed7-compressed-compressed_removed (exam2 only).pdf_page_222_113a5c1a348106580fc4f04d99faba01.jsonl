Direct marketing Email and mobile
Permission for any kind of direct marketing must be explicitly given to the company Trying to 
gain permission in a sneaky way is illegal and should never be done

SMS credibility 
Reputation via SMS is just as important consumers are becoming increasingly suspicious of 
marketing messages in general so reputation is important to convince the customer even to 
take your message seriously 
To make sure your SMS is credible youll need to pay attention to how its written the message 
itself the words you use and so on Time of delivery is also important as is branding the 
message so that your customer knows who its from Remember the key send users only what 
they want when they want it and youll be trusted
165 MEASURING SUCCESS
As with all things digital marketing tracking analysing and optimising are key to growth and 
success Most direct messaging tracking systems produce statistics in a userfriendly manner 
Key measurables for understanding the performance of direct marketing campaigns include
	
Number of emails or SMSs delivered 
	
Number of bounces This should be separated into hard bounces and soft bounces 
	
Number of unique opens To explain this consider this example If one of your customers
recipients of your email opens the email ten times it will count as ten overall opens but only 
one unique open If two customers open it ten times each it will count as twenty overall 
opens but only two unique opens
	
Unsubscribes Significant or consistent loss in subscribers is an indication that you are 
not meeting the needs of your subscribers 
	
Passon rate A high passon rate forwards indicates that your customers value the content 
enough to share it constantly with others Adding a signup link to forwarded emails will 
organically grow the optin list 
	
Clickthrough rates and conversion These measure the effectiveness of a message via 
the links placed in the content When a reader clicks through to a web page these can be 
easily measured as a percentage against the number of delivered opened or sent emails 
It reveals which content or promotion was the most enticing for the reader 
Some metrics are more useful than others A good example of this is the open rate Emails are 
tracked using a tiny transparent image that gets downloaded but some email desktop clients 
block the downloading of images If the tracking image doesnt load the email wont register 
as opened However this can be factored in to some extent and open rates give you an idea 
of how well your subject lines resonate
