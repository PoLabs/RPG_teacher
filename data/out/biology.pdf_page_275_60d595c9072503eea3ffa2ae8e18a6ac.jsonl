Figure 913 The enzyme phospholipase C breaks down PIP2 into IP3 and DAG both of which serve as second
messengers
93  Response to the Signal
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how signaling pathways direct protein expression cellular metabolism and cell growth

Identify the function of PKC in signal transduction pathways

Recognize the role of apoptosis in the development and maintenance of a healthy organism
Inside the cell ligands bind to their internal receptors allowing them to directly affect the cells DNA and protein
producing machinery Using signal transduction pathways receptors in the plasma membrane produce a variety
of effects on the cell The results of signaling pathways are extremely varied and depend on the type of cell
involved as well as the external and internal conditions A small sampling of responses is described below
Gene Expression
Some signal transduction pathways regulate the transcription of RNA Others regulate the translation of proteins
from mRNA An example of a protein that regulates translation in the nucleus is the MAP kinase ERK The
MAPKERK pathway also known as the RasRafMEKERK pathway is a chain of proteins in the cell that
communicates a signal from a receptor on the surface of the cell to the nuclear DNA ERK is activated in a
phosphorylation cascade when epidermal growth factor EGF binds the EGF receptor see Figure 910 Upon
phosphorylation ERK enters the nucleus and activates a protein kinase that in turn regulates protein translation
