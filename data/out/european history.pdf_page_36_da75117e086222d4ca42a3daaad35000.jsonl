widespread after 1815 specifically in the writing of European histories that 
placed Europes origins in the medieval Christian Church the Roman Empire 
Greek democracy or the ancient German assemblies These narratives were 
of course serving very different political purposes while traditionalists 
like Joseph de Maistre defended medieval unity under the Roman Catholic 
Church as the core of European history liberals like the French politician 
Franois Guizot 17871874 saw a plurality of values religions and political 
regimes as the common heritage that supposedly powered the progress of 
the continent Some of them even travelled to Greecewhich they saw as the 
cradle of Europes principal political idea democracyin order to fight for 
its independence as a brother nation Many liberal authors such as Guizot 
or the SwissFrench activist Benjamin Constant 17671830 opposed the 
standardised Napoleonian Europe arguing that European civilisation was 
characterised by cultural and political plurality and peaceful commerce 
According to them it was precisely this plurality that let Europe prosper and 
would lead to a future of peace and freedom
Patterns of Power in Europe
At the beginning of the nineteenth century for most rulers soldiers and 
diplomats the idea of Europe was mainly concerned with external peace and 
security To uphold these they imagined two antithetical solutions that of 
a hegemonic panEuropean universal monarchy or European Empire and 
that of a balance of power between various great powers within a stable 
European system of states Universal monarchy had its roots in the empires 
of Rome and Charlemagne and for nearly a thousand years the Holy Roman 
Empire 9621806 that loose multilayered political structure at Europes 
centre remained its most important embodiment The balance of power was a 
more recent idea that emerged after the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia that ended 
the Thirty Years War 161848 The treaty had formally introduced to the 
realm of European politics a vision of Europe as a patchwork of sovereign 
statespolitical entities in other words ruled by princes or in exceptional 
cases republican governments with mutually exclusive claims to authority 
over clearly demarcated territories Although references to a European whole 
often framed as Christianity were still quite common the state had now 
become the central reference point of international politics Particularly in 
the eighteenth century it was thought to be the primary task of princes and 
foreign policy experts to ably manage the balance of power and uphold a 
multipolar states system in order to prevent a return to universal monarchy 
ie hegemony by any single one of them
When in 1804 Napoleon established a new French Empire to replace 
the almost extinct Holy Roman Empire and win hegemony over Europe
