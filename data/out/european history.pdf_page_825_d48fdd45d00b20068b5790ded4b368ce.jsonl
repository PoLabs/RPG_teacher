However the notion of childhood as a critical period of human development
when intensive moral patriotic and scientific education was supposed to 
take place for the childs sake as well as societysgenerally steepened the 
requirements of parental involvement particularly by mothers While elite 
couples continued to leave their children with hired women of poorer origins 
or particularly in Great Britain sent them off to boarding schools before they 
reached puberty a model of intensive motherhood appealed to all social 
classes compounding the division between the figures of the father as the 
breadwinner and the mother as the caregiver and educator
The democratisation of access to secondary and to a much lesser extent 
higher education often increased the gender gap between siblings as the 
families tended to follow gender rather than academic criteria when choosing 
which child to support through their studies anticipating that the future

that the overall emphasis on education and the introduction of meritocratic 
procedures made their exclusion from higher education hard to sustain While

marrying a man with a similar or higher level of studies
Overall a structured institutionalised education has come to mark the early 
lives of all people in Europe and far beyond Firstly it demarcated between 
an age of carefree play and the age of academic learning a frontier that has 
become more blurred with the growing focus on academic as opposed to 
playbased learning in childcare before mandatory schooling begins It has 
also created a strong sense of belonging to very specific age groupsa specific 
year group even Education has made youth last longer and in some cases 
has impacted family dynamics such that going to university now means 
leaving home While there are important regional differences concerning 
the relationship between education and familygenerational dynamics it 
is remarkable how many of the abovementioned trends are transnational 
despite education being one of the most important areas of intervention for 
each countrys government since the nineteenth century
Conclusion 
The nineteenth century was a period of profound change for family structures 
The reshaping of the legal systems inaugurated by the French Revolution 
and the Napoleonic Code redefined family relations and inheritance and 
ultimately affected family structure But perhaps the most powerful force in
