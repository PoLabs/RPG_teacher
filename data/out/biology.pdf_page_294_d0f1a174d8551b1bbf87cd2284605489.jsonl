change is visible However during the G1 stage the cell is quite active at the biochemical level The cell is
accumulating the building blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as accumulating
sufficient energy reserves to complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus
S Phase Synthesis of DNA
Throughout interphase nuclear DNA remains in a semicondensed chromatin configuration In the S phase
DNA replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA
moleculessister chromatidsthat are firmly attached to the centromeric region The centrosome is also
duplicated during the S phase The two centrosomes of homologous chromosomes will give rise to the mitotic
spindle the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis For example roughly
at the center of each animal cell the centrosomes are associated with a pair of rodlike objects the centrioles
which are positioned at right angles to each other Centrioles help organize cell division We should note
however that centrioles are not present in the centrosomes of other eukaryotic organisms such as plants and
most fungi
G2 Phase Second Gap
In the G2 phase the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome
manipulation and movement Some cell organelles are duplicated and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide
resources for the mitotic phase There may be additional cell growth during G2 The final preparations for the
mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is able to enter the first stage of mitosis
The Mitotic Phase
The mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned separated
and move into two new identical daughter cells The first portion of the mitotic phase is called karyokinesis
or nuclear division As we have just seen the second portion of the mitotic phase and often viewed as a
process separate from and following mitosis is called cytokinesisthe physical separation of the cytoplasmic
components into the two daughter cells
