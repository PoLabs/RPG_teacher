UNIT 5 ECONOMY

An example is the taxation of consumption of primarily basic goods such as 
food and drinks Moreover as the rise of taxation on a state level was often 
caused by increasing military spending in times of crisis it hit hard especially 
in times of economic stagnation However some small communities installed 
regimes of taxation that primarily taxed the wealthier households and thus 
moderated inequality to some extent This was the case for example in some 
communities in Catalonia
It has been suggested that throughout the early modern period catastrophic 
events such as floods earthquakes droughts diseases and wars had an 
inequalityreducing effect The reasoning behind this argument is that such 
catastrophes either destroyed forms of wealth or had a demographic shock 
effect that impacted the distribution of wealth and income However there 
is little to support this generalisation In many places throughout Western 
Europe the plague of 13461353 indeed had an inequalityreducing effect 
over the long term However this was an exceptional case and later plagues 
would often lead to an increase in inequality Other disaster at times had an 
inequalityreducing effect in the short term but led to increases in inequality 
in the longer term Also here local political arrangements power relations and 
systems of coordination determined the evolution of inequality
Reactions to Inequality
The gradual erosion of feudal arrangements in parts of Europe in the late 
medieval period can be understood in terms of peasants taking advantage of 
changing demographic conditions after the Black Death to transform the terms 
of their tenure throwing off burdensome labour services and restrictions on 
movement and negotiating limits on rents that were justified in terms of 
manorial custom At the same time they asserted collective rights over certain 
resources such as access to common lands again framing these as customary 
rights held since time immemorial Thus in contrast to early modern political 
and mercantilist theory which presented the sovereign and the rich as sole 
determinants of the distribution of wealth in certain parts of Europe at the 
outset of the early modern period nonelites had secured considerable agency 
over how wealth was distributed at the local level Defending and extending 
these rights was one element of the late medieval tradition of popular revolt 
That said the economic changes of the early modern period meant that this 
position was increasingly under threat from landowners while the social 
solidarity of rural communities was being eroded by the changes implicit in 
the demise of feudalism
These contests were particularly apparent in England where custom 
possessed a notable power due to the system of common law based on
