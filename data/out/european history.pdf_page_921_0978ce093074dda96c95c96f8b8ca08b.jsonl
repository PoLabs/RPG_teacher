Sports and Nationalism
As nationalism grew during the age of the Napoleonic Wars it became apparent 
that sport and physical education would be influenced by nationalistic ideas 
Public health and physical fitness were seen as one of the major aspects of 
national welfare The healthier and fitter the nation was the better its economic 
productivity and military capacity would be In these terms healthy and fit 
nations could better compete for resources not only against other European 
nations but against countries all over the world Political and economic leaders 
of states and nations therefore argued in favour of organised sport and physical 
exercise programmes
Unlike in Great Britain where competitive sports clubs were most popular 
in continental Europe gymnastics and collective exercising were initially 
dominant In contrast to sports like football or rugby gymnastics was non
competitive Thus while developing and strengthening the bodies of individual 
gymnasts it also focused firmly on group cooperation and building a spirit of 
mutual solidarity between team members
One of the first individuals to realise the potential of physical education in 
the service of the nation was German pedagogue Friedrich Ludwig Jahn 1778
1852 In 1810 influenced by nationalist antiNapoleonic philosophy Jahn 
and a group of colleagues founded the Deutscher Bund a secret organisation 
whichthrough organised group exerciseaimed to increase patriotism 
among German people and prepare them for the battle of national liberation
For most of the first half of the nineteenth century Jahns Deutscher Bund 
and the German gymnastics movement Turnbewegung which was based 
on his ideas were forbidden in German lands After the Revolution of 1848 
many of the socalled Turner were forced into exile outside Europe The 
majority went to the USA where their ideas swiftly spread Jahns principles 
for exercise were also adopted in many other European countries and were 
used to further the formation of physically strong and healthy populations 
Jahns contribution to Germans physical abilities was first fully recognised 
after the successful process of unification of Germany in the 1860s and 1870s 
The praxis of Turnen as a popular form of physical education was gradually 
expanded to all Germanspeaking areas in Central Europe but would later 
be heavily exploited by Nazi ideology
The idea of collective exercise inspired by Jahn was also instrumental to 
the formation of national sports movements in other countries One example 
is the Czech Sokol organisation which also became popular among Czech
