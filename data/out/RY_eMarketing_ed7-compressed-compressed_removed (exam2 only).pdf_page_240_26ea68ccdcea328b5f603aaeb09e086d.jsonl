Social media advertising
While promoted ads arent the same thing as responding to customers the same principle 
applies fit your tone and content to the platform On Facebook a more neutral but still 
brandrelevant tone is best since their audience is broad and reading that audience 
can be difficult On other platforms because you can see more about the users you are 
speaking to it can be easier to adapt your tone to them Remember that your tone should 
also be informed by your brand identity and overarching strategy
Third use your regular unpaid posts to test out your paid ads Make sure that you use effective 
social media copy in every post Keep your copy short and to the point with a clear call to 
action that tells the reader exactly what to do next and give them a reason to click or carry out 
the CTA Then track which posts are being liked shared or commented on  those should be 
your first choice for paid promotion The feedback you get on posts is often nearinstantaneous 
which allows you to respond quickly to whichever posts are doing well and which are doing 
badly Facebook Ads Manager can help you do AB testing by putting equal funds behind two 
different posts The one that gets a better initial response gets the rest of the funds
Fourth rotate ads often Social media users expect fresh content they should not be seeing the 
same ad multiple times over multiple days so rotate ads every three to five days Hootsuite 
2016 The general rule is that a user should see an ad a maximum of four times
