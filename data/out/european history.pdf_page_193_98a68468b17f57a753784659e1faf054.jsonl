Unlike in the case of the Jews the situation of the Roma witnessed few 
substantial improvements even as the early modern period came to a close
Europes Indigenous Peoples
Ambivalence also characterised the dealings of majority populations with 
ethnic groups today recognised as indigenous peoples within Europe such as 
the Tatars in PolandLithuania the Sorbs in Poland and Germany or the Sami 
in northern Scandinavia Among these groups the Sami deserve particular 
attention because they formed one of the last remaining European groups of 
preChristian faith The largely but not exclusively nomadic reindeerherding 
Sami inhabited territories divided between Russia DenmarkNorway and 
Sweden Especially as suppliers of expensive furs many Sami groups were 
closely integrated into commercial networks in all three polities Although 
Christian missions to the Sami had already been undertaken in the Middle 
Ages the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw a renewal of statebacked 
Christianisation efforts by Swedish and Norwegian Protestants as well as 
Russian Orthodox monks Intended to stamp out pagan beliefs missionaries 
undertook considerable efforts to seek out and destroy traditional religious 
sites while establishing new churches in Sami settlements
Even in the eighteenth century the Sami who were called Laplanders 
at the time had a reputation for witchcraft and magic which seems to have 
been connected to traditional shamanic practices interpreted by the Christian 
clergy and rulers as devil worship Although King Christian IV of Denmark 
and Norway 15771648 issued a decree calling for the vigorous persecution 
of Sami witchcraft in 1609 the number of Sami accused of this crime was 
relatively low suggesting that despite their reputation the Sami were not 
particularly vulnerable to allegations of witchcraft
Both witchcraft persecutions and renewed missionary efforts need to be 
seen in the context of attempts by Swedish and DanishNorwegian monarchs 
to increase control over the Sami through taxation and trade Especially in the 
eighteenth century the Scandinavian crowns promoted the influx of Finnish 
and Swedish settlers with the aim of developing their northern territories 
agriculturally while an increasing number of Sami abandoned their nomadic 
lifestyle to take up farming and animal husbandry The same period however 
also witnessed an expansion of Sami reindeer herding which continued to 
require a nomadic lifestyle
Politically the Sami nomads played a key role in the attempts of Denmark
Norway and Sweden to delineate their common borders since claims to 
territorial control were linked to usage of the land by the subjects of the respective
