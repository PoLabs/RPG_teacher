constituted as freemen granted participatory rights to meet in a general court 
and vote for company governors irrespective of how much they had invested 
The EIC was initially financed on a voyagebyvoyage basis with investors 
paid a share of the profits on return only in the 1650s was a permanent joint 
stock founded This difference in organisation was reflected too in the EICs 
commercial strategy as compared to the aggressive VOC Initially the EIC was 
reluctant to engage in expensive military and territorial enterprises hoping 
to profit from arbitrage buying low in Asia and selling high in Europe via a 
network of trading factories rather than control production in Asia Even so it 
was increasingly drawn into participation in the intraAsian country trade as 
a means to generate purchasing power to pay for imports into Europe where 
there was an imbalance of trade with Asia The EICs inability to prevent 
its agents in Asia from trading independently ultimately became an asset

the EIC acquire rule over extensive trading settlements like Bombay beginning 
its gradual shift into a territorial power in India By the 1690s its shares were 
being traded on the London stock market

other hand these company states performed roles quite alien to the modern 
corporation they were granted rights of government including to make 
war at least with nonEuropeans This was a sign of their origins in Europe 
characterised by hybrid sovereignty which could be deployed creatively in 
Asia the VOC could assume a very different face when acting as vassals to 
the Tokugawa Shogun as compared to its role as colonial power in the Banda 
Islands for instance 
The success of these companies also meant that they were imitated both 
by other European nations seeking to trade with the Far East and in order to 
challenge Spanish domination in the Atlantic Here they were less successful 
the jointstock Virginia Company chartered by the English Crown in 1606 
foundered once Virginia became a cropproducing economy in which long
term investment and local management was advantageous The Dutch West 
India Company had a longer existence and conquered Iberian Brazil and 
Angola However its endeavours were extremely expensive and it was less
