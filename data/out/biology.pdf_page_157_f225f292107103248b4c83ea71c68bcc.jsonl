Proteins
Proteins comprise the plasma membranes second major component Integral proteins or integrins as their
name suggests integrate completely into the membrane structure and their hydrophobic membranespanning
regions interact with the phospholipid bilayers hydrophobic region Figure 52 Singlepass integral membrane
proteins usually have a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that consists of 2025 amino acids Some span
only part of the membraneassociating with a single layerwhile others stretch from one side to the other
and are exposed on either side Up to 12 single protein segments comprise some complex proteins which are
extensively folded and embedded in the membrane Figure 55 This protein type has a hydrophilic region
or regions and one or several mildly hydrophobic regions This arrangement of protein regions orients the
protein alongside the phospholipids with the proteins hydrophobic region adjacent to the phosopholipids tails
and the proteins hydrophilic region or regions protruding from the membrane and in contact with the cytosol or
extracellular fluid
Figure 55 Integral membrane proteins may have one or more alphahelices that span the membrane examples 1 and
2 or they may have betasheets that span the membrane example 3 credit FoobarWikimedia Commons
