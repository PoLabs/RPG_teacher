the responsiveness of the design and that all the elements work across the various devices 
and possible views 
Test websites on different browsers and operating systems for example Google Chrome on IOS 
and Google Chrome on Android devices Various tools are available to assist in this process 
one being BrowserStack browserstackcom BrowserStack allows you to test various operating 
systems and devices from within your browser MDN 2016
