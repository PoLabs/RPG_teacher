167  Cancer and Gene Regulation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how changes to gene expression can cause cancer

Explain how changes to gene expression at different levels can disrupt the cell cycle

Discuss how understanding regulation of gene expression can lead to better drug design
Cancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases In cancer cells mutations modify cellcycle
control and cells dont stop growing as they normally would Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the
progression of the cell through the cell cycle One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is
increased phosphorylation of cyclin B a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and
serves as a cellcycle checkpoint protein
For cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle the cell must pass through checkpoints This ensures
that the cell has properly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function
Many proteins including cyclin B control these checkpoints The phosphorylation of cyclin B a posttranslational
event alters its function As a result cells can progress through the cell cycle unimpeded even if mutations
exist in the cell and its growth should be terminated This posttranslational change of cyclin B prevents it from
controlling the cell cycle and contributes to the development of cancer
Cancer Disease of Altered Gene Expression
Cancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression There are many proteins that are turned
on or off gene activation or gene silencing that dramatically alter the overall activity of the cell A gene that is
not normally expressed in that cell can be switched on and expressed at high levels This can be the result of
gene mutation or changes in gene regulation epigenetic transcription posttranscription translation or post
translation
Changes in epigenetic regulation transcription RNA stability protein translation and posttranslational control
can be detected in cancer While these changes dont occur simultaneously in one cancer changes at each of
these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals Therefore changes
in histone acetylation epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing activation of transcription factors
by phosphorylation increased RNA stability increased translational control and protein modification can all be
detected at some point in various cancer cells Scientists are working to understand the common changes that
give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell
Tumor Suppressor Genes Oncogenes and Cancer
In normal cells some genes function to prevent excess inappropriate cell growth These are tumorsuppressor
genes which are active in normal cells to prevent uncontrolled cell growth There are many tumorsuppressor
genes in cells The most studied tumorsuppressor gene is p53 which is mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer
types The p53 protein itself functions as a transcription factor It can bind to sites in the promoters of genes to
initiate transcription Therefore the mutation of p53 in cancer will dramatically alter the transcriptional activity of
its target genes
