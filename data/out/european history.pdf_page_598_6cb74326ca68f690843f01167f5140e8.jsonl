Empiretariff barriers increased Increasing international competition and 
the capitalintensive character of most economic sectors blocked the creation 
of new firms and brought about an oligopolistic industrial and business 
structure Big companies established various forms of horizontal combination 
strategies The cartel was thus a defensive cooperation plan among companies 
from the same sector aimed at limiting competition dividing up the market 
and fixing prices This could result in the limitation of production in their 
respective plants andor the establishment of barriers to the entrance of new 
competitors both at a domestic and international level
How Business Worked in the Nineteenth Century Three 
Examples
Tea
With early industrialisation tea became affordable to all social classes While 
still retaining its refined appeal to the elites it also became a product for mass 
consumption as a stimulant suited to the new factory discipline as a substitute 
for alcoholic beverages and thanks to the availability of sugar from the West 
Indies Contrary to other mildly addictive commoditiessuch as coffee 
tobacco and cocoatea cultivation was not based in the New World but was 
instead maintained in Asia Since the early modern period it spread as an item 
of conspicuous consumption among the upper classes of various European 
countries including Great Britain the Netherlands France Germany and 
Russia While tea consumed in Russia was brought by land through Siberia 
the other countries imported it by sea The Dutch initially dominated imports 
from Asia but the British broke through in 1784 the year in which import fees 
were severely reduced so as to revive the English East India Company EIC 
China was the main exporter of tea until the midnineteenth century 
However the European balance of trade with China was negative Until 1833 
the EIC monopolised imports from China into Britain and exported opium 
from India into China resulting in serious consequences for Chinese society 
and government After 1833 private merchants such as Jardine Matheson  
Co entered the trade
In the late eighteenth century the British introduced tea cultivation in 
northern India In 1839 the Assam Tea Company was formed and by the 1860s 
cultivation had spread to other regions in the Himalayan foothills particularly 
Darjeeling but also Ceylon after 1879 Exports of tea from India to Europe 
began to displace Chinese production in the 1870s between 1870 and 1900 
Assam Tea exports out of India increased twentyfold Industrialised tea 
cultivation was introduced with ambitious deforestation plans and changes
