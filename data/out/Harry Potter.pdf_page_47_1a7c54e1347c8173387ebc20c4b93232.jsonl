dream
Tap Tap Tap
All right Harry mumbled Im getting up
He sat up and Hagrids heavy coat fell off him The hut was full of
sunlight the storm was over Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed
sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper
held in its beak
Harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon
was swelling inside him He went straight to the window and jerked it
open The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid who
didnt wake up The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to
attack Hagrids coat
Dont do that
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak
fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat
Hagrid said Harry loudly Theres an owl
Pay him Hagrid grunted into the sofa
What
He wants payin fer deliverin the paper Look in the pockets
Hagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets  bunches of
keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabags
finally Harry pulled out a handful of strangelooking coins
Give him five Knuts said Hagrid sleepily
Knuts
The little bronze ones
Harry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg
so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it Then
he flew off through the open window
