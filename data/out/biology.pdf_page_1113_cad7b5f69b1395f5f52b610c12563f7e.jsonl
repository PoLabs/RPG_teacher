postsynaptic
membrane
caused
by
neurotransmitter molecules released from a presynaptic cell
part of the cerebral cortex that contains the motor cortex and areas involved in planning attention
and language
also glial cells cells that provide support functions for neurons
plural gyri ridged protrusions in the cortex
brain structure in the temporal lobe involved in processing memories
change in the membrane potential to a more negative value
brain structure that controls hormone release and body homeostasis
hyperpolarization
of
a
postsynaptic
membrane
caused
by
neurotransmitter molecules released from a presynaptic cell
connected brain areas that process emotion and motivation
prolonged decrease in synaptic coupling between a pre and postsynaptic cell
prolonged increase in synaptic coupling between a preand postsynaptic cell
mental illness characterized by prolonged periods of sadness
difference in electrical potential between the inside and outside of a cell
membrane that covers and protects the central nervous system
glia that scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms
fatty substance produced by glia that insulates axons
nervous system disorder characterized by the progressive loss of neurological
functioning usually caused by neuron death
specialized cell that can receive and transmit electrical and chemical signals
gaps in the myelin sheath where the signal is recharged
neurotransmitter and hormone released by activation of the sympathetic nervous system
part of the cerebral cortex that contains visual cortex and processes visual stimuli
glial cell that myelinates central nervous system neuron axons
division of autonomic nervous system that regulates visceral functions
during rest and digestion
part of the cerebral cortex involved in processing touch and the sense of the body in space
neurodegenerative disorder that affects the control of movement
thin membrane layer directly covering the brain and spinal cord
sense about how parts of the body are oriented in space
glia that serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their final destinations
