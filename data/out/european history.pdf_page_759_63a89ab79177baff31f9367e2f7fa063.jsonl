Liberalism and Democracy 
Liberalism was born in the struggle to find a middle way between the 
revolution which created liberty as well as licence and Napoleon who had 
introduced the revolutionary order through all of Europe by means of a

liberalism chastened by revolutionary excesses opted for a middle way 
between absolutism and revolution that is why the Doctrinaire liberals with 
Franois Guizot 17871874 at their head called themselves the men of the 
juste milieu the middle way and seized power after the July Revolution of
