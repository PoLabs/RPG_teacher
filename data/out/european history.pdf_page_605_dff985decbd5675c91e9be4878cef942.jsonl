The most important case was that of Russia and later the Soviet Union 
During the Russian Civil War 19171923 the Bolshevik revolutionaries set 
up the system of socalled war communism characterised partly by the 
overwhelming power of the state labour duty requisitions bans on private 
enterprise and partly by governmentrun intrafirm management to secure 
the supply of the army control foreign trade enforce strict labour discipline 
and implement strict coordination between productive units 
The experiment in war communism ultimately failed mainly because 
of a lack of cooperation and support from the peasants who were not fully 
integrated into the national market system and becausein the long run
productivity was too low to secure provisions and prevent food shortages in 
the urban centres To tackle the looming food crisis and to push the rapid 
industrialisation of the country forward the Soviet government eventually 
introduced collectivisationa policy that forced nomads eg in Kazakhstan 
to settle down as farmers and the peasants in the Soviet empire eg in the 
Ukraine to give up their individuallyused farms and join large collective 
agricultural units Historians such as Robert Kindler and Robert Conquest 
have convincingly argued that these measures led to severe and recurring 
famine and may have cost more than 15 million lives 
Collectivisation went handinhand with industrialisation and in 1928 
the first fiveyear plan pyatiletka 19281932 was introduced This system of 
command economywhere the economic plans were de jure laws and not 
fulfilling them was an infringement of the lawwas later expanded to the 
economies of postWorld War Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe The 
system lasted until the collapse of the EasternSoviet Bloc in 19891991 While 
Soviet command economies seemed to be working for a while especially
as economic historians such as Eric Hobsbawm and others have arguedin 
the context of crises wars especially the Second World War and during 
reconstruction economic performance soon diminished From the 1960s 
onwards it became apparent that neither their productive capacities nor their 
stability and ability to fulfil public demand for goods and services could in any 
way compete with the economies in Western Europe and the United States 
Hence from the 1970s onwards most planned economies were sliding from 
crisis to crisis
The Marshall Plan and the Reorganisation of Western 
Europe
The Second World War and its aftermath transformed the economies and 
markets of Western Europe It has been argued that in many ways they 
became more American countless US consumer products were in high
