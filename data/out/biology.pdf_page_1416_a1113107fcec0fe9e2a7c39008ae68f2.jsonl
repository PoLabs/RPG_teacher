CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
14 Ecologists often collaborate with other
researchers interested in ecological questions
Describe the levels of ecology that would be easier
for collaboration because of the similarities of
questions asked What levels of ecology might be
more difficult for collaboration
15 The population is an important unit in ecology as
well as other biological sciences How is a population
defined and what are the strengths and weaknesses
of this definition Are there some species that at
certain times or places are not in populations
16 Compare and contrast ocean upwelling and
spring and fall turnovers
17 Many endemic species are found in areas that
are geographically isolated Suggest a plausible
scientific explanation for why this is so
18 The extremely low precipitation of subtropical
desert biomes might lead one to expect fire to be a
major disturbance factor however fire is more
common in the temperate grassland biome than in
the subtropical desert biome Why is this
19 In what ways are the subtropical desert and the
arctic tundra similar
20 Scientists have discovered the bodies of humans
and other living things buried in bogs for hundreds of
years but not yet decomposed Suggest a possible
biological explanation for why such bodies are so
wellpreserved
21 Describe the conditions and challenges facing
organisms living in the intertidal zone
22 Compare and contrast how natural and human
induced processes have influenced global climate
change
23 Predict possible consequences if carbon
emissions from fossil fuels continue to rise
