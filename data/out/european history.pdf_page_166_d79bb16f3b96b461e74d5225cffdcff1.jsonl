Demographic Transition
In 1798 the British reverend and demographer Robert Thomas Malthus 1766
1834 published the first edition of his essay on population Malthus believed 
that population growth was close to stationary as limited food supplies kept 
populations in check This mechanism has become known as the Malthusian 
trap Ironically Malthuss essay signalled the end of an old demographic 
regime when Malthus published the different versions of An Essay on the 
Principle of Population the relationship between population growth and 
food scarcity had started to vanish This process began with the socalled 
agricultural and commercial revolution of earlier times but gained speed over 
the course of the nineteenth century with the massive and ongoing use of fossil 
fuels leading to increasing returns on human labour
The world population doubled in size over the course of the nineteenth 
century The estimated world population reached the first billion around 
1800 and more than one fifth of that figure lived in Europe Around a century 
later immediately after the First World War the estimated world population 
was approaching the second billion with Europe accounting for a quarter of 
that number The speed and sheer size of the growth was unprecedented the 
previous doubling of the world population had taken roughly three centuries
