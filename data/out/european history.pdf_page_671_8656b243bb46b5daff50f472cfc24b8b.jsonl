scale thus enabling further reductions in costs for the industry and prices for 
consumers
The energy crises of the 1970s brought an end to the production boom a 
boom which came from sectors relying on cheap energy Industry was forced to 
become more adaptive to changes but this only increased the outflow of labour 
from the secondary to the tertiary sector With the steady decline of industrys 
share of total employment the potential for production growth diminished as 
well The everstronger internal market of the EEC and EU concentrated high
tech industry within Europe while outsourcing lowskill assembly industries 
to other regions mainly East Asia The growing production of hightech 
electronic and office machinery was one small exception to this rule
Socialist Production
By the 1920s the revolutionary upheavals which had followed the First 
World War across Europe had subsided and the Soviet Union began the great 
experiment the construction of socialism in one country Within a short time 
the Soviet Union wanted to turn their underdeveloped rural country into a 
modern industrial economy This attempt at modernisation built on state 
ownership and a planned economy instead of private ownership and a market 
economy Accordingly land was nationalised and the factories became state
owned Production was not driven by any supplyanddemand business plan 
but by calculations and estimates presented by the central planning office 
which created economic plans from estimates for specific periods mostly for 
five years These were then passed along to the production plants through 
compulsory plan directives For example the Central Planning Office calculated 
how many pairs of shoes industry would produce for the Soviet population 
each year Prices and anticipated earnings were also regulated centrally The 
interests of heavy industry always overshadowed the production of consumer 
goods Therefore the supply of goods was always kept below the actual market 
needs and the demand for goods was guaranteed The same strategy was 
applicable to foreign trade which was carried out by stateowned enterprises 
In order to find buyers from free market countries producers designated to 
produce goods for export had two production lines superior standard ones 
for export and inferior ones for the local market
In the fiveyear plans the development of heavy industry and military 
industry was given priority and agriculture became an inner colony from 
which income and labour could be reallocated to industry
This economic model was exported by the Soviet Union to the territories 
that came under its influence after the Second World War As a result of 
nationalisations and collectivisation campaigns private enterprise was almost
