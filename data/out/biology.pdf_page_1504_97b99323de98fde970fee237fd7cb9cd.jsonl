Biogeographer
Biogeography is the study of the distribution of the worlds speciesboth in the past and in the present
The work of biogeographers is critical to understanding our physical environment how the environment
affects species and how environmental changes impact the distribution of a species it has also been critical
to developing modern evolutionary theory Biogeographers need to understand both biology and ecology
They also need to be wellversed in evolutionary studies soil science and climatology
There are three main fields of study under the heading of biogeography ecological biogeography historical
biogeography called paleobiogeography and conservation biogeography Ecological biogeography
studies the current factors affecting the distribution of plants and animals Historical biogeography as the
name implies studies the past distribution of species Conservation biogeography on the other hand is
focused on the protection and restoration of species based upon known historical and current ecological
information Each of these fields considers both zoogeography and phytogeographythe past and present
distribution of animals and plants
One of the oldest observed patterns in ecology is that species biodiversity in almost every taxonomic group
increases as latitude declines In other words biodiversity increases closer to the equator Figure 473
Figure 473 This map illustrates the number of amphibian species across the globe and shows the trend toward higher
biodiversity at lower latitudes A similar pattern is observed for most taxonomic groups The white areas indicate a lack
of data in this particular study
It is not yet clear why biodiversity increases closer to the equator but scientists have several hypotheses
One factor may be the greater age of the ecosystems in the tropics versus those in temperate regions the
temperate regions were largely devoid of life or were drastically reduced during the last glaciation The idea
is that greater age provides more time for speciation Another possible explanation is the increased direct
energy the tropics receive from the sun versus the decreased intensity of the solar energy that temperate and
polar regions receive Tropical ecosystem complexity may promote speciation by increasing the heterogeneity
or number of ecological niches in the tropics relative to higher latitudes The greater heterogeneity provides
more opportunities for coevolution specialization and perhaps greater selection pressures leading to population
differentiation However this hypothesis suffers from some circularityecosystems with more species
encourage speciation but how did they get more species to begin with
The tropics have been perceived as being more stable than temperate regions which have a pronounced
climate and daylength seasonality The tropics have their own forms of seasonality such as rainfall but they
