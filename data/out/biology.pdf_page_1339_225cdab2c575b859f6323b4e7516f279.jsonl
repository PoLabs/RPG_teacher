proteins results in various systemic diseases As illustrated in Figure 4227 systemic lupus erythematosus may
affect the heart joints lungs skin kidneys central nervous system or other tissues causing tissue damage via
antibody binding complement recruitment lysis and inflammation
Figure 4227 Systemic lupus erythematosus is characterized by autoimmunity to the individuals own DNA andor
proteins which leads to varied dysfunction of the organs credit modification of work by Mikael Hggstrm
Autoimmunity can develop with time and its causes may be rooted in molecular mimicry Antibodies and TCRs
may bind self antigens that are structurally similar to pathogen antigens which the immune receptors first raised
As an example infection with Streptococcus pyogenes bacterium that causes strep throat may generate
antibodies or T cells that react with heart muscle which has a similar structure to the surface of S pyogenes
These antibodies can damage heart muscle with autoimmune attacks leading to rheumatic fever Insulin
dependent Type 1 diabetes mellitus arises from a destructive inflammatory TH1 response against insulin
producing cells of the pancreas Patients with this autoimmunity must be injected with insulin that originates from
other sources
