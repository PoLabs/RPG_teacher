44 UNDERSTANDING AND CONTROLLING THE ENVIRONMENT

Attempts to prevent or at least contain the outbreak of epidemic disease 
showcased a similar mix of traditional and new methods Throughout the 
period cities and states everywhere in Europe combatted the many outbreaks of 
infectious diseases by issuing regulations aimed at isolating the sick imposing 
hygiene in public places and restricting trade with the outside world Such 
measures could be quite effective if they were strictly enforcedwhich was 
not easy New methods adopted from the Middle East were employed in the 
fight against smallpox from at least the early eighteenth century onward forms 
of variolation were practiced in various parts of Europe Healthy individuals 
were inoculated with small amounts of pus or scabs from a smallpox patient in 
order to trigger a mild case of the disease gaining immunity in the process The 
practice was not without risks but through trial and error doctors gradually 
refined variolation methods reducing the number of casualties One of these 
doctors Thomas Dimsdale 17121800 published his method in 17671768 
Variolation paved the way for the next step which followed at the very end of 
the century experiments by the English physician Edward Jenner showed that 
inoculations with the relatively benign cowpox virus also conferred immunity 
against smallpox 
Technology and the State
Early modern societies experienced a dramatic technological change 
inextricably linked to their increasing control over the environment Two major 
lines of development were important First the scientific revolution of the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries led to a more comprehensive and precise 
grasp on the environment Statistics show a surge in scientific discoveries 
and technological inventions between ca 1500 and 1700 With physics and 
chemistry providing new models and categories for understanding the 
environment and scholars such as Galileo Galilei 15641642 Johannes 
Kepler 15711630 and Isaac Newton 16431727 publishing foundational 
works that would help tame natural forces the early modern age also saw the 
introduction of prototypes of calculating devices and telescopes which would 
fundamentally alter human understanding of the environment Second this 
process was embedded in the larger context of empire and conquest As 
mentioned earlier the early modern period was an epoch in which humans 
were constantly expanding their radius of movement and intervening more 
and more in both indigenous civilisations and ecosystems The discovery of 
America is just as much a part of this story as the technological penetration of 
hitherto sparsely explored European peripheries 
Early modern Europeans used both new and old technologies to adjust the 
environment to their needs New scientific methods and bodies of knowledge 
as well as new scientific discoveries and associated technology aided the
