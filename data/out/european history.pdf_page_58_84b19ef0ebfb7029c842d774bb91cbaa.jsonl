According to Barth the communities of early modern Europe shared basic 
needs not only to define themselves in opposition to others and to mark social 
and cultural boundaries but also to protect and delineate the territories they 
were living in But there were also specificities to this process some of them 
such as language were present throughout the period under study while 
others evolved through time such as the religious composition of a population
Varieties of Geographical and Political Borders and Types 
of Travel
In the early modern period political borders and the territorial state were 
often marked by blazes on trees boulders ditches earth mounds or by 
signposts There were no comprehensive systems of control posts or guard 
patrols To protect their border regions against outside invasion a number of 
early modern states established a system of smaller camps and larger castles 
This was the case for example in the secondbiggest state of this period the 
Kingdom of PolandLithuania
These political borders were very rarely linked to tax or customs borders 
As in the Middle Ages toll roads mountain passes and narrow points on 
rivers were used to collect tolls and customs The control of these checkpoints 
was often exercised by vassals In the Holy Roman Empire the Electorate of 
Mainz was one such vassal that controlled the toll point on the Rhine river 
near the town of Bingen In Central European regions town walls also marked 
tax borders a system that had likewise been adopted during the Middle Ages
Named natural borders howeverphysically incontestable as they might 
seemoften did not completely overlap with cultural borders There are 
some exceptions such as the Rhine River which had had a double function as 
natural and cultural border since the fall of the Roman Empire The mountain 
ranges of the Alps and Pyrenees also marked such a unified natural and 
cultural border Finally seas such as the Strait of Dover or the North and 
Baltic Seas marked combined natural and cultural borders separating Britain 
Ireland and Scandinavia from its Southern neighbours But in general neither 
rivers nor coasts nor mountains in themselves constituted inevitable cultural 
dividing lines between states
Of course geographical phenomena like mountains rivers and lakes limited 
travel options for greater parts of early modern preindustrial populations But 
apart from physical barriers travel was generally possible between countries 
in early modern times without controls On the Italian Peninsula consisting 
of some dozen states and particularly in Central Europe in the Holy Roman 
Empire of the German Nation consisting of around 1800 territories local rulers 
were technically incapable of controlling their borders In France however a
