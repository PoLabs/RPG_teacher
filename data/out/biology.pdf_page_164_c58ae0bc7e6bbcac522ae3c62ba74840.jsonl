gradient through a membrane Sometimes pressure enhances the diffusion rate causing the substances to filter
more rapidly This occurs in the kidney where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying
dissolved substances or solutes out of the blood and into the renal tubules The diffusion rate in this instance
is almost totally dependent on pressure One of the effects of high blood pressure is the appearance of protein
in the urine which abnormally high pressure squeezes through
Facilitated transport
In facilitated transport or facilitated diffusion materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help
of membrane proteins A concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell
without expending cellular energy However these materials are polar molecule ions that the cell membranes
hydrophobic parts repel Facilitated transport proteins shield these materials from the membranes repulsive
force allowing them to diffuse into the cell
The transported material first attaches to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the plasma membranes exterior
surface This allows removal of material from the extracellular fluid that the cell needs The substances then
pass to specific integral proteins that facilitate their passage Some of these integral proteins are collections of
betapleated sheets that form a pore or channel through the phospholipid bilayer Others are carrier proteins
which bind with the substance and aid its diffusion through the membrane
Channels
The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are transport proteins and they function as either
channels for the material or carriers In both cases they are transmembrane proteins Channels are specific
for the transported substance Channel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and
extracellular fluids In addition they have a hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated
opening through the membrane layers Figure 59 Passage through the channel allows polar compounds to
avoid the plasma membranes nonpolar central layer that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the
cell Aquaporins are channel proteins that allow water to pass through the membrane at a very high rate
Figure 59 Facilitated transport moves substances down their concentration gradients They may cross the plasma
membrane with the aid of channel proteins credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal
Channel proteins are either open at all times or they are gated which controls the channels opening When
a particular ion attaches to the channel protein it may control the opening or other mechanisms or substances
may be involved In some tissues sodium and chloride ions pass freely through open channels whereas in
other tissues a gate must open to allow passage An example of this occurs in the kidney where there are both
channel forms in different parts of the renal tubules Cells involved in transmitting electrical impulses such as
nerve and muscle cells have gated channels for sodium potassium and calcium in their membranes Opening
and closing these channels changes the relative concentrations on opposing sides of the membrane of these
ions resulting in facilitating electrical transmission along membranes in the case of nerve cells or in muscle
