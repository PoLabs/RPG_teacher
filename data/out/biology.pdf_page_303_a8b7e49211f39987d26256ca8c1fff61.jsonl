Figure 1012 Cyclindependent kinases Cdks are protein kinases that when fully activated can phosphorylate and
thus activate other proteins that advance the cell cycle past a checkpoint To become fully activated a Cdk must bind
to a cyclin protein and then be phosphorylated by another kinase
Because the cyclic fluctuations of cyclin levels are largely based on the timing of the cell cycle and not on specific
events regulation of the cell cycle usually occurs by either the Cdk molecules alone or the Cdkcyclin complexes
Without a specific concentration of fully activated cyclinCdk complexes the cell cycle cannot proceed through
the checkpoints
Although the cyclins are the main regulatory molecules that determine the forward momentum of the cell cycle
there are several other mechanisms that finetune the progress of the cycle with negative rather than positive
effects These mechanisms essentially block the progression of the cell cycle until problematic conditions are
resolved Molecules that prevent the full activation of Cdks are called Cdk inhibitors Many of these inhibitor
molecules directly or indirectly monitor a particular cellcycle event The block placed on Cdks by inhibitor
molecules will not be removed until the specific event that the inhibitor monitors is completed
