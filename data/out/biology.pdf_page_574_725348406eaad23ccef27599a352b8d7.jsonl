segmented which contributes to its variability and continuous evolution and explains why it is difficult to develop
a vaccine against it
In DNA viruses the viral DNA directs the host cells replication proteins to synthesize new copies of the viral
genome and to transcribe and translate that genome into viral proteins Human diseases caused by DNA viruses
include chickenpox hepatitis B and adenoviruses Sexually transmitted DNA viruses include the herpes virus
and the human papilloma virus HPV which has been associated with cervical cancer and genital warts
RNA viruses contain only RNA as their genetic material To replicate their genomes in the host cell the RNA
viruses must encode their own enzymes that can replicate RNA into RNA or in the retroviruses into DNA These
RNA polymerase enzymes are more likely to make copying errors than DNA polymerases and therefore often
make mistakes during transcription For this reason mutations in RNA viruses occur more frequently than in
DNA viruses This causes them to change and adapt more rapidly to their host Human diseases caused by RNA
viruses include influenza hepatitis C measles and rabies The HIV virus which is sexually transmitted is an
RNA retrovirus
The Challenge of Virus Classification
Because most viruses probably evolved from different ancestors the systematic methods that scientists have
used to classify prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are not very useful If viruses represent remnants of different
organisms then even genomic or protein analysis is not useful Why Because viruses have no common
genomic sequence that they all share For example the 16S rRNA sequence so useful for constructing
prokaryote phylogenies is of no use for a creature with no ribosomes Biologists have used several classification
systems in the past Viruses were initially grouped by shared morphology Later groups of viruses were classified
by the type of nucleic acid they contained DNA or RNA and whether their nucleic acid was single or double
stranded However these earlier classification methods grouped viruses differently because they were based
on different sets of characters of the virus The most commonly used classification method today is called the
Baltimore classification scheme and is based on how messenger RNA mRNA is generated in each particular
type of virus
Past Systems of Classification
Viruses contain only a few elements by which they can be classified the viral genome the type of capsid and
the envelope structure for the enveloped viruses All of these elements have been used in the past for viral
classification Table 211 and Figure 216 Viral genomes may vary in the type of genetic material DNA or
RNA and its organization single or doublestranded linear or circular and segmented or nonsegmented In
some viruses additional proteins needed for replication are associated directly with the genome or contained
within the viral capsid
