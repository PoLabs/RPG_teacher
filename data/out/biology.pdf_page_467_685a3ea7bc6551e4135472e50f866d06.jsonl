polymerase binding CAP is itself activated by cAMP whose concentration rises as the concentration of
glucose falls However the lac operon also requires the presence of lactose for transcription to occur Lactose
inactivates the lac repressor and prevents the repressor protein from binding to the lac operator With the
repressor inactivated transcription may proceed Therefore glucose must be absent and lactose must be
present for effective transcription of the lac operon
163 Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation
In eukaryotic cells the first stage of geneexpression control occurs at the epigenetic level Epigenetic
mechanisms control access to the chromosomal region to allow genes to be turned on or off Chromatin
remodeling controls how DNA is packed into the nucleus by regulating how tightly the DNA is wound around
histone proteins The DNA itself may be methylated to selectively silence genes The addition or removal of
chemical modifications or flags to histone proteins or DNA signals the cell to open or close a chromosomal
region Therefore eukaryotic cells can control whether a gene is expressed by controlling accessibility to the
binding of RNA polymerase and its transcription factors
164 Eukaryotic Transcription Gene Regulation
To start transcription general transcription factors such as TFIID TFIIB and others must first bind to the TATA
box and recruit RNA polymerase to that location Additional transcription factors may also bind to other
regulatory elements at the promoter to increase or prevent transcription In addition to promoter sequences
enhancer regions help augment transcription Enhancers can be upstream downstream within a gene itself or
on other chromosomes Specific transcription factors bound to enhancer regions may either increase or prevent
transcription
165 Eukaryotic Posttranscriptional Gene Regulation
Posttranscriptional control can occur at any stage after transcription including RNA splicing and RNA stability
Once RNA is transcribed it must be processed to create a mature RNA that is ready to be translated This
involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein Spliceosomes bind to the signals that mark the
exonintron border to remove the introns and ligate the exons together Once this occurs the RNA is mature
and can be translated Alternative splicing can produce more than one mRNA from a given transcript Different
splicing variants may be produced under different conditions
RNA is created and spliced in the nucleus but needs to be transported to the cytoplasm to be translated RNA
is transported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex Once the RNA is in the cytoplasm the length
of time it resides there before being degraded called RNA stability can also be altered to control the overall
amount of protein that is synthesized The RNA stability can be increased leading to longer residency time in
the cytoplasm or decreased leading to shortened time and less protein synthesis RNA stability is controlled
by RNAbinding proteins RPBs and microRNAs miRNAs These RPBs and miRNAs bind to the 5 UTR or
the 3 UTR of the RNA to increase or decrease RNA stability MicroRNAs associated with RISC complexes may
repress translation or lead to mRNA breakdown
166 Eukaryotic Translational and Posttranslational Gene Regulation
Changing the status of the RNA or the protein itself can affect the amount of protein the function of the protein
or how long it is found in the cell To translate the protein a protein initiator complex must assemble on the
RNA Modifications such as phosphorylation of proteins in this complex can prevent proper translation from
occurring Once a protein has been synthesized it can be modified phosphorylated acetylated methylated or
ubiquitinated These posttranslational modifications can greatly impact the stability degradation or function of
the protein
167 Cancer and Gene Regulation
Cancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression Changes at every level of eukaryotic gene
expression can be detected in some form of cancer at some point in time In order to understand how changes
to gene expression can cause cancer it is critical to understand how each stage of gene regulation works in
normal cells By understanding the mechanisms of control in normal nondiseased cells it will be easier for
scientists to understand what goes wrong in disease states including complex ones like cancer
