Figure 347 The avian esophagus has a pouch called a crop which stores food Food passes from the crop to
the first of two stomachs called the proventriculus which contains digestive juices that breakdown food From the
proventriculus the food enters the second stomach called the gizzard which grinds food Some birds swallow stones
or grit which are stored in the gizzard to aid the grinding process Birds do not have separate openings to excrete
urine and feces Instead uric acid from the kidneys is secreted into the large intestine and combined with waste from
the digestive process This waste is excreted through an opening called the cloaca
Avian Adaptations
Birds have a highly efficient simplified digestive system Recent fossil evidence has shown that the
evolutionary divergence of birds from other land animals was characterized by streamlining and simplifying
the digestive system Unlike many other animals birds do not have teeth to chew their food In place of
lips they have sharp pointy beaks The horny beak lack of jaws and the smaller tongue of the birds can
be traced back to their dinosaur ancestors The emergence of these changes seems to coincide with the
inclusion of seeds in the bird diet Seedeating birds have beaks that are shaped for grabbing seeds and
the twocompartment stomach allows for delegation of tasks Since birds need to remain light in order to fly
their metabolic rates are very high which means they digest their food very quickly and need to eat often
Contrast this with the ruminants where the digestion of plant matter takes a very long time
Ruminants
Ruminants are mainly herbivores like cows sheep and goats whose entire diet consists of eating large
amounts of roughage or fiber They have evolved digestive systems that help them digest vast amounts of
cellulose An interesting feature of the ruminants mouth is that they do not have upper incisor teeth They use
their lower teeth tongue and lips to tear and chew their food From the mouth the food travels to the esophagus
