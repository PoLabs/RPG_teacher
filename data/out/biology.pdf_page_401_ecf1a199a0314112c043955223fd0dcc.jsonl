Figure 1413 Meselson and Stahl experimented with E coli grown first in heavy nitrogen 15N then in 14N DNA grown
in 15N red band is heavier than DNA grown in 14N orange band and sediments to a lower level in cesium chloride
solution in an ultracentrifuge When DNA grown in 15N is switched to media containing 14N after one round of cell
division the DNA sediments halfway between the 15N and 14N levels indicating that it now contains fifty percent 14N In
subsequent cell divisions an increasing amount of DNA contains 14N only These data support the semiconservative
replication model credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal
The E coli culture was then placed into medium containing 14N and allowed to grow for several generations
After each of the first few generations the cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated then centrifuged
at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge During the centrifugation the DNA was loaded into a gradient typically a
solution of salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose and spun at high speeds of 50000 to 60000 rpm Under
these circumstances the DNA will form a band according to its buoyant density the density within the gradient
at which it floats DNA grown in 15N will form a band at a higher density position ie farther down the centrifuge
tube than that grown in 14N Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in 14N after they
had been shifted from 15N the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells
grown exclusively in 15N and 14N This suggested either a semiconservative or dispersive mode of replication
The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14N formed two bands one DNA band was at the
intermediate position between 15N and 14N and the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA These results
could only be explained if DNA replicates in a semiconservative manner And for this reason therefore the
other two models were ruled out
During DNA replication each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which
new strands are copied The new strands will be complementary to the parental or old strands When two
daughter DNA copies are formed they have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter
cells
