the alveoli and entering the blood of the capillaries where O2 binds to hemoglobin At the same time alveolar
PCO2 is lower PALVO 2  40 mm Hg than blood PCO2  45 mm Hg CO2 diffuses down its pressure gradient
moving out of the capillaries and entering the alveoli
Oxygen and carbon dioxide move independently of each other they diffuse down their own pressure gradients
As blood leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins the venous PO2  100 mm Hg whereas the venous
PCO2  40 mm Hg As blood enters the systemic capillaries the blood will lose oxygen and gain carbon dioxide
because of the pressure difference of the tissues and blood In systemic capillaries PO2  100 mm Hg but in
the tissue cells PO2  40 mm Hg This pressure gradient drives the diffusion of oxygen out of the capillaries
and into the tissue cells At the same time blood PCO2  40 mm Hg and systemic tissue PCO2  45 mm Hg
The pressure gradient drives CO2 out of tissue cells and into the capillaries The blood returning to the lungs
through the pulmonary arteries has a venous PO2  40 mm Hg and a PCO2  45 mm Hg The blood enters the
lung capillaries where the process of exchanging gases between the capillaries and alveoli begins again Figure

Figure 3913 The partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide change as blood moves through the body
Which of the following statements is false
a
In the tissues PO2 drops as blood passes from the arteries to the veins while PCO2 increases
b
Blood travels from the lungs to the heart to body tissues then back to the heart then the lungs
c
Blood travels from the lungs to the heart to body tissues then back to the lungs then the heart
d
PO2 is higher in air than in the lungs
In short the change in partial pressure from the alveoli to the capillaries drives the oxygen into the tissues and
the carbon dioxide into the blood from the tissues The blood is then transported to the lungs where differences
in pressure in the alveoli result in the movement of carbon dioxide out of the blood into the lungs and oxygen
