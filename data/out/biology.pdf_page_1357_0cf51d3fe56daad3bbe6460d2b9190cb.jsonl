Spermatogenesis
Figure 4312 During spermatogenesis four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte
Spermatogenesis illustrated in Figure 4312 occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules Figure 438
with stem cells at the periphery of the tube and the spermatozoa at the lumen of the tube Immediately under
the capsule of the tubule are diploid undifferentiated cells These stem cells called spermatogonia singular
spermatagonium go through mitosis with one offspring going on to differentiate into a sperm cell and the other
giving rise to the next generation of sperm
Meiosis starts with a cell called a primary spermatocyte At the end of the first meiotic division a haploid cell
is produced called a secondary spermatocyte This cell is haploid and must go through another meiotic cell
division The cell produced at the end of meiosis is called a spermatid and when it reaches the lumen of the
tubule and grows a flagellum it is called a sperm cell Four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that
goes through meiosis
Stem cells are deposited during gestation and are present at birth through the beginning of adolescence but in
an inactive state During adolescence gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary cause the activation of
these cells and the production of viable sperm This continues into old age
