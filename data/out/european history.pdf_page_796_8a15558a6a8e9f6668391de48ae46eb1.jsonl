commercialisation of agricultural products However like any nineteenth
century government they also strove to use modern infrastructure to foster 
their control of the territory in both military and administrative terms Local 
elites shared with the Ottoman authorities an interest in boosting local 
economies but often had their own political agenda such as promoting their 
regions autonomy independence or even future territorial expansion to 
neighbouring lands Foreign investors and railway companies also extracted 
profits while acting as agents of foreign countries and their geopolitical 
interests Concerning infrastructures the Ottoman and postOttoman Balkans 
became in the second half of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth 
century a true European periphery Politicians and investors from the wealthy 
and mighty European centres were able to draw and build the main lines of the 
railways in the region while local actors including the Ottoman government 
were able to set their priorities and benefit from roads ports and a few minor 
railway lines
Conclusion
Throughout the nineteenth century the steam engine reshaped the geography 
of Europe The construction of new railway lines brought entire regions out 
of marginality or allowed for better integration into increasingly connected 
markets This new European geography was not only technological or 
economic however The same process of intensification of exchange can 
be observed in the cultural sphere with the same scale effects To give one 
example in the case of theatre the city of Madrid seemed to lag behind the 
great cultural capitals of the century such as Paris London and Vienna As 
the capital of a country with a fragile central state and delayed entry into 
industrialisation Madrid was on the cultural periphery of Europe However 
seen from the perspective of the Hispanic cultural empire the capital of Spain 
was the source of many theatrical and musical productions exported to its own 
Latin American peripheries
