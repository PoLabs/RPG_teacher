converted back into dsDNA genomes by reverse transcriptase necessary for genome replication
The characteristics of each group in the Baltimore classification are summarized in Table 213 with examples of
each group
Baltimore Classification
Group
Characteristics
Mode of mRNA Production
Example
I
Doublestranded
DNA
mRNA is transcribed directly from the DNA template
Herpes simplex
herpesvirus
II
Singlestranded
DNA
DNA is converted to doublestranded form before RNA is
transcribed
Canine
parvovirus
parvovirus
III
Doublestranded
RNA
mRNA is transcribed from the RNA genome
Childhood
gastroenteritis
rotavirus
IV
Single stranded
RNA 
Genome functions as mRNA
Common cold
picornavirus
V
Single stranded
RNA 
mRNA is transcribed from the RNA genome
Rabies
rhabdovirus
VI
Single stranded
RNA viruses with
reverse
transcriptase
Reverse transcriptase makes DNA from the RNA
genome DNA is then incorporated in the host genome
mRNA is transcribed from the incorporated DNA
Human
immunodeficiency
virus HIV
VII
Double stranded
DNA viruses with
reverse
transcriptase
The viral genome is doublestranded DNA but viral DNA
is replicated through an RNA intermediate the RNA may
serve directly as mRNA or as a template to make mRNA
Hepatitis B virus
hepadnavirus

212  Virus Infections and Hosts
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

List the steps of replication and explain what occurs at each step

Describe the lytic and lysogenic cycles of virus replication

Explain the transmission of plant and animal viruses

Discuss some of the diseases caused by plant and animal viruses

Discuss the economic impact of plant and animal viruses
Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites A virus must first recognize and attach to a specific living cell prior to
entering it After penetration the invading virus must copy its genome and manufacture its own proteins Finally
the progeny virions must escape the host cell so that they can infect other cells Viruses can infect only certain
species of hosts and only certain cells within that host Specific host cells that a virus must occupy and use
to replicate are called permissive In most cases the molecular basis for this specificity is due to a particular
surface molecule known as the viral receptor on the host cell surface A specific viral receptor is required for
the virus to attach In addition differences in metabolism and hostcell immune responses based on differential
gene expression are a likely factor in determining which cells a virus may target for replication
