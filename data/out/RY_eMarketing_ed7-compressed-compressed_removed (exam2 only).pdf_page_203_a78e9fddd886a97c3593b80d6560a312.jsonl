Value and reciprocity 
The best way to avoid coming across as invasive and intrusive for mobile users is to ensure 
that every message you send on this personal device is valuable to them Push notifications 
from apps for example have a high engagement rate but users wont opt in unless you are 
offering clear value and have taken the time to build up some trust Digital consumers have far 
too many distractions competing for their attention to pay attention to an unsolicited marketing 
message that gives them nothing
Offering value to mobile users does two things It helps to build up relationships and as a 
result loyalty and it uses the principle of reciprocity If you give consumers something they 
are more likely to be willing to give something back
For this reason any messages you send directly to users should be helpful and set the customer 
up to remember you in a positive light For example a hotel could send a confirmation sms a 
reminder or a way to shorten the checkin process or a query about whether the guest needs 
anything upon arrival None of these would be seen as intrusive
Offering real value to your consumer wont amount to much if theyre not reading the messages 
you send which they wont if they dont trust you To build up that trust you need to consistently 
invest in a value exchange their attention for your message 
Relationships 
If you practice permission marketing and offer value to your mobile audience you will ultimately 
build a stronger relationship with your customers These relationships can result in a higher 
customer lifetime value as well as positive sentiment which can be spread by your audience 
and result in more converts to your brand 
Because mobiles ability to connect you to your customer at their moment of need is unpar
alleled so is its ability to help you build a connection with your brands followers When used 
well mobile devices offer an effective way to build strong relationships and those relationships 
should be your primary focus
