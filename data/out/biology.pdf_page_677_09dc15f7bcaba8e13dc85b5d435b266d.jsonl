Introduction
The word fungus comes from the Latin word for mushrooms Indeed the familiar mushroom is a reproductive
structure used by many types of fungi However there are also many fungus species that dont produce
mushrooms at all Being eukaryotes a typical fungal cell contains a true nucleus and many membranebound
organelles The kingdom Fungi includes an enormous variety of living organisms collectively referred to as
Eucomycota or true Fungi While scientists have identified about 100000 species of fungi this is only a fraction
of the 15 million species of fungus likely present on Earth Edible mushrooms yeasts black mold and the
producer of the antibiotic penicillin Penicillium notatum are all members of the kingdom Fungi which belongs
to the domain Eukarya
Fungi once considered plantlike organisms are more closely related to animals than plants Fungi are not
capable of photosynthesis they are heterotrophic because they use complex organic compounds as sources of
energy and carbon Fungi share a few other traits with animals Their cell walls are composed of chitin which is
found in the exoskeletons of arthropods Fungi produce a number of pigments including melaninalso found in
the hair and skin of animals Like animals fungi also store carbohydrates as glycogen However like bacteria
fungi absorb nutrients across the cell surface and act as decomposers helping to recycle nutrients by breaking
down organic materials to simple molecules
Some fungal organisms multiply only asexually whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual
reproduction with alternation of generations Most fungi produce a large number of spores which are haploid
cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular haploid individuals
Fungi often interact with other organisms forming beneficial or mutualistic associations For example most
