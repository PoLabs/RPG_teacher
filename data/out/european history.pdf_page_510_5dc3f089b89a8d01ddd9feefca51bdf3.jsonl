Across the Communist bloc the increase in public early years provision was 
especially marked For example in the German Democratic Republic women 
were expected to return to work soon after their children were born and 
highquality nurseries were set up to take care of their infants Across much of 
Western Europe by contrast women in the middle decades of the twentieth 
century were expected to stay at homeor for those who had worked during 
the war effort to return hometo care for their young families and they were 
encouraged to do so with various forms of child benefit
Debates about fertility rates as well as child benefit and childcare continued 
to shape European welfare politics well into the late twentieth and early twenty
first centuries These discussions were partly shaped by the mass introduction 
of the birth control pill after 1960 which meant that women and couples 
could shape their own reproductive lives more than ever before However the 
birth rate was now not as much a reflection of worries about nationalism and 
militarismalthough of course these nationalist anxieties never diminished 
entirely from view especially as new waves of postwar migration from 
former European colonies and beyond such as guest workers from Turkey 
precipitated anxieties about increasing numbers of nonwhite populations 
or interracial children Instead the declining birth rate in countries such as 
West Germany and Italy was primarily a concern because the large social 
security systems that had been erected after the Second World War relied on 
new young workers to contribute part of their salary to keep them going 
At the same time demands for access to affordable highquality childcare 
grew in the decades after 1968 along with the associated rise of Second Wave 
Feminism which saw an increase in women not only working but seeking 
longterm careers and wellpaid jobs 
Thus over the course of the twentieth century and into the twentyfirst 
expectations that social policy and the state more generally were necessary and 
useful supports for the family grew Nonetheless the relationship between the 
state and the family was always complex sometimes morally challenging and 
often fraught
Welfare Systems in and as GovernmentEast and West
in the Twentieth Century 
During the twentieth century grassroots sociopolitical activism changing 
ideals and a changing political landscape culminated throughout large parts 
of Europe in the institutionalisation of various types of welfare systems In 
the West the aftermath of the Second World War is often associated with 
the birth of the modern welfare state Although states and governments in 
previous centuries also set up initiatives and instruments to ensure the welfare
