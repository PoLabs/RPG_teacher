ion and has a 1 sodium cation or 1 chloride anion charge Note that these transactions can normally only
take place simultaneously in order for a sodium atom to lose an electron it must be in the presence of a suitable
recipient like a chlorine atom
Figure 211 In the formation of an ionic compound metals lose electrons and nonmetals gain electrons to achieve an
octet
Ionic bonds form between ions with opposite charges For instance positively charged sodium ions and
negatively charged chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride or table salt creating a
crystalline molecule with zero net charge
Physiologists refer to certain salts as electrolytes including sodium potassium and calcium ions necessary
for nerve impulse conduction muscle contractions and water balance Many sports drinks and dietary
supplements provide these ions to replace those lost from the body via sweating during exercise
Covalent Bonds and Other Bonds and Interactions
Another way to satisfy the octet rule by sharing electrons between atoms to form covalent bonds These bonds
are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms We commonly
find covalent bonds in carbonbased organic molecules such as our DNA and proteins We also find covalent
bonds in inorganic molecules like H2O CO2 and O2 The bonds may share one two or three pairs of electrons
making single double and triple bonds respectively The more covalent bonds between two atoms the stronger
their connection Thus triple bonds are the strongest
The strength of different levels of covalent bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult
time in acquiring nitrogen for use in constructing their molecules even though molecular nitrogen N2 is the
most abundant gas in the atmosphere Molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each
other and as with all molecules sharing these three pairs of electrons between the two nitrogen atoms allows
for filling their outer electron shells making the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atoms This
strong triple bond makes it difficult for living systems to break apart this nitrogen in order to use it as constituents
of proteins and DNA
Forming water molecules provides an example of covalent bonding Covalent bonds bind the hydrogen and
oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules as Figure 29 shows The electron from the hydrogen splits
its time between the hydrogen atoms incomplete outer shell and the oxygen atoms incomplete outer shell To
completely fill the oxygens outer shell which has six electrons but which would be more stable with eight two
electrons one from each hydrogen atom are needed hence the wellknown formula H2O The two elements
share the electrons to fill the outer shell of each making both elements more stable

Polar Covalent Bonds
There are two types of covalent bonds polar and nonpolar In a polar covalent bond Figure 212 shows
atoms unequally share the electrons and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other Because of the
unequal electron distribution between the atoms of different elements a slightly positive  or slightly negative
 charge develops This partial charge is an important property of water and accounts for many of its
characteristics
