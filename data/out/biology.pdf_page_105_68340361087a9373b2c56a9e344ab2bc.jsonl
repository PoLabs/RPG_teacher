Denaturation and Protein Folding
Each protein has its own unique sequence and shape that chemical interactions hold together If the protein is
subject to changes in temperature pH or exposure to chemicals the protein structure may change losing its
shape without losing its primary sequence in what scientists call denaturation Denaturation is often reversible
because the polypeptides primary structure is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed
allowing the protein to resume its function Sometimes denaturation is irreversible leading to loss of function
One example of irreversible protein denaturation is frying an egg The albumin protein in the liquid egg white
denatures when placed in a hot pan Not all proteins denature at high temperatures For instance bacteria that
survive in hot springs have proteins that function at temperatures close to boiling The stomach is also very
acidic has a low pH and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process however the stomachs digestive
enzymes retain their activity under these conditions
Protein folding is critical to its function Scientists originally thought that the proteins themselves were
responsible for the folding process Only recently researchers discovered that often they receive assistance in
the folding process from protein helpers or chaperones or chaperonins that associate with the target protein
during the folding process They act by preventing polypeptide aggregation that comprise the complete protein
