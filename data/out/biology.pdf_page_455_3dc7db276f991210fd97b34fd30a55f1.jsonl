164  Eukaryotic Transcription Gene Regulation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the role of transcription factors in gene regulation

Explain how enhancers and repressors regulate gene expression
Like prokaryotic cells the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the action of an RNA polymerase to bind
to a DNA sequence upstream of a gene in order to initiate transcription However unlike prokaryotic cells the
eukaryotic RNA polymerase requires other proteins or transcription factors to facilitate transcription initiation
RNA polymerase by itself cannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells There are two types of transcription
factors that regulate eukaryotic transcription General or basal transcription factors bind to the core promoter
region to assist with the binding of RNA polymerase Specific transcription factors bind to various regions outside
of the core promoter region and interact with the proteins at the core promoter to enhance or repress the activity
of the polymerase

The Promoter and the Transcription Machinery
Genes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier The promoter region is immediately
upstream of the coding sequence This region can be short only a few nucleotides in length or quite long
hundreds of nucleotides long The longer the promoter the more available space for proteins to bind This
also adds more control to the transcription process The length of the promoter is genespecific and can
differ dramatically between genes Consequently the level of control of gene expression can also differ quite
dramatically between genes The purpose of the promoter is to bind transcription factors that control the
initiation of transcription
Within the core promoter region 25 to 35 bases upstream of the transcriptional start site resides the TATA
box The TATA box has the consensus sequence of 5TATAAA3 The TATA box is the binding site for a
protein complex called TFIID which contains a TATAbinding protein Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription
factors including TFIIB TFIIE TFIIF and TFIIH Some of these transcription factors help to bind the RNA
polymerase to the promoter and others help to activate the transcription initiation complex
In addition to the TATA box other binding sites are found in some promoters Some biologists prefer to restrict
the range of the eukaryotic promoter to the core promoter or polymerase binding site and refer to these
