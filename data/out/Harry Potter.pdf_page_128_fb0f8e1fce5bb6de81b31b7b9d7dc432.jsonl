it quickly and pressed their ears against it listening
Which way did they go Peeves Filch was saying Quick tell me
Say please

Shant say nothing if you dont say please said Peeves in his

All right please

away and Filch cursing in rage
He thinks this door is locked Harry whispered I think well be okay
 get off Neville For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of
Harrys bathrobe for the last minute What
Harry turned around  and saw quite clearly what For a moment he
was sure hed walked into a nightmare  this was too much on top of
everything that had happened so far
They werent in a room as he had supposed They were in a corridor The
forbidden corridor on the third floor And now they knew why it was
forbidden
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that
filled the whole space between ceiling and floor It had three heads
Three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching
and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging
in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs
It was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and Harry
knew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their
sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting
over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant
Harry groped for the doorknob  between Filch and death hed take
Filch
