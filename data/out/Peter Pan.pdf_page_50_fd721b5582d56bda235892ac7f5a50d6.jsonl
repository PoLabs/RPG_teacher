Wendy saw his hook grip the boats side she saw his evil swarthy
face as he rose dripping from the water and quaking she would
have liked to swim away but Peter would not budge He was tingling
with life and also topheavy with conceit Am I not a wonder oh I
am a wonder he whispered to her and though she thought so also
she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no one heard
him except herself
He signed to her to listen
The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their
captain to them but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of
profound melancholy
Captain is all well they asked timidly but he answered with a
hollow moan
He sighs said Smee
He sighs again said Starkey
And yet a third time he sighs said Smee
Then at last he spoke passionately
The games up he cried those boys have found a mother
Affrighted though she was Wendy swelled with pride
O evil day cried Starkey
Whats a mother asked the ignorant Smee
Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed He doesnt know
and always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee
would be her one
Peter pulled her beneath the water for Hook had started up
crying What was that
I heard nothing said Starkey raising the lantern over the waters
and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight It was the nest I
have told you of floating on the lagoon and the Never bird was
sitting on it
See said Hook in answer to Smees question that is a mother
What a lesson The nest must have fallen into the water but would
the mother desert her eggs No
There was a break in his voice as if for a moment he recalled
innocent days whenbut he brushed away this weakness with his
hook
Smee much impressed gazed at the bird as the nest was borne
past but the more suspicious Starkey said If she is a mother
perhaps she is hanging about here to help Peter
Hook winced Ay he said that is the fear that haunts me
He was roused from this dejection by Smees eager voice
Captain said Smee could we not kidnap these boys mother
and make her our mother
It is a princely scheme cried Hook and at once it took practical
shape in his great brain We will seize the children and carry them
to the boat the boys we will make walk the plank and Wendy shall
be our mother
Again Wendy forgot herself
Never she cried and bobbed
