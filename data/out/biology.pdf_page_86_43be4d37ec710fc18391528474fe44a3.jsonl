Polysaccharides
A long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is a polysaccharide poly  many The chain
may be branched or unbranched and it may contain different types of monosaccharides The molecular weight
may be 100000 daltons or more depending on the number of joined monomers Starch glycogen cellulose
and chitin are primary examples of polysaccharides
Plants store starch in the form of sugars In plants an amylose and amylopectic mixture both glucose polymers
comprise these sugars Plants are able to synthesize glucose and they store the excess glucose beyond the
their immediate energy needs as starch in different plant parts including roots and seeds The starch in the
seeds provides food for the embryo as it germinates and can also act as a food source for humans and animals
Enzymes break down the starch that humans consume For example an amylase present in saliva catalyzes
or breaks down this starch into smaller molecules such as maltose and glucose The cells can then absorb the
glucose
Glucose starch comprises monomers that are joined by  14 or  16 glycosidic bonds The numbers 14 and
16 refer to the carbon number of the two residues that have joined to form the bond As Figure 39 illustrates
unbranched glucose monomer chains only  14 linkages form the starch whereas amylopectin is a branched
polysaccharide  16 linkages at the branch points
