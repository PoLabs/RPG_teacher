inorganic elemental molecule that carries out important roles in the body
digestive system that consists of a singlechambered stomach
animal that consumes both plants and animals

component of food that is low in energy and high in fiber
animal with a stomach divided into four compartments
enzyme found in saliva which converts carbohydrates to maltose
hormone which stimulates sodium bicarbonate secretion in the small intestine
