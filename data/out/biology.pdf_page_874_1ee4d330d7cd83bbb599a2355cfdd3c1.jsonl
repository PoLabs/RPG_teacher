Anura Frogs
Frogs Figure 2919 are amphibians that belong to the order Anura or Salientia jumpers Anurans are among
the most diverse groups of vertebrates with approximately 5965 species that occur on all of the continents
except Antarctica Anurans ranging from the minute New Guinea frog at 7 mm to the huge goliath frog at 32 cm
from tropical Africa have a body plan that is more specialized for movement Adult frogs use their hind limbs
and their arrowlike endoskeleton to jump accurately to capture prey on land Tree frogs have hands adapted for
grasping branches as they climb In tropical areas flying frogs can glide from perch to perch on the extended
webs of their feet Frogs have a number of modifications that allow them to avoid predators including skin
that acts as camouflage Many species of frogs and salamanders also release defensive chemicals that are
poisonous to predators from glands in the skin Frogs with more toxic skins have bright warning aposematic
coloration
