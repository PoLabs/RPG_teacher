161  Regulation of Gene Expression
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss why every cell does not express all of its genes all of the time

Describe how prokaryotic gene regulation occurs at the transcriptional level

Discuss how eukaryotic gene regulation occurs at the epigenetic transcriptional posttranscriptional
translational and posttranslational levels
For a cell to function properly necessary proteins must be synthesized at the proper time and place All cells
control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA The process of turning on
a gene to produce RNA and protein is called gene expression Whether in a simple unicellular organism or a
complex multicellular organism each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed For this to occur
there must be internal chemical mechanisms that control when a gene is expressed to make RNA and protein
how much of the protein is made and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no longer needed
The regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space It would require a significant amount of energy
for an organism to express every gene at all times so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes only when
they are required In addition only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because DNA must be
unwound from its tightly coiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA Cells would have to be enormous
if every protein were expressed in every cell all the time
The control of gene expression is extremely complex Malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell and
can lead to the development of many diseases including cancer
Prokaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression
To understand how gene expression is regulated we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional
protein in a cell The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells just in slightly different manners
Prokaryotic organisms are singlecelled organisms that lack a cell nucleus and their DNA therefore floats
freely in the cell cytoplasm To synthesize a protein the processes of transcription and translation occur almost
simultaneously When the resulting protein is no longer needed transcription stops As a result the primary
method to control what type of protein and how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is
the regulation of DNA transcription All of the subsequent steps occur automatically When more protein is
required more transcription occurs Therefore in prokaryotic cells the control of gene expression is mostly at
the transcriptional level
Eukaryotic cells in contrast have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity In eukaryotic cells the
DNA is contained inside the cells nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA The newly synthesized RNA
is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm where ribosomes translate the RNA into protein
The processes of transcription and translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane transcription
occurs only within the nucleus and translation occurs only outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm The regulation
of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process Figure 162 Regulation may occur when the DNA
is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors  epigenetic level when the RNA
is transcribed  transcriptional level when the RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is
transcribed  posttranscriptional level when the RNA is translated into protein  translational level or after
the protein has been made  posttranslational level
