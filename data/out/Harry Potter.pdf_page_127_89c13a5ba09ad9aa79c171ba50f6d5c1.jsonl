Harry thought she was probably right but he wasnt going to tell her
that
Lets go
It wasnt going to be that simple They hadnt gone more than a dozen
paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a
classroom in front of them
It was Peeves He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight
Shut up Peeves  please  youll get us thrown out
Peeves cackled
Wandering around at midnight Ickle Firsties Tut tut tut Naughty
naughty youll get caughty
Not if you dont give us away Peeves please
Should tell Filch I should said Peeves in a saintly voice but his
eyes glittered wickedly Its for your own good you know
Get out of the way snapped Ron taking a swipe at Peeves this was a
big mistake
STUDENTS OUT OF BED Peeves bellowed STUDENTS OUT OF BED
DOWN THE
CHARMS CORRIDOR
Ducking under Peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the
corridor where they slammed into a door  and it was locked
This is it Ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door Were
done for This is the end They could hear footsteps Filch running as
fast as he could toward Peevess shouts
Oh move over Hermione snarled She grabbed Harrys wand tapped the
lock and whispered Alohomora
The lock clicked and the door swung open  they piled through it shut
