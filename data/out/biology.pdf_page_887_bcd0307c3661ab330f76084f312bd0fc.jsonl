birds to become and stay airborne The feathers on a wing are flexible so the feathers at the end of the
wing separate as air moves over them reducing the drag on the wing Flight feathers are also asymmetrical
and curved so that air flowing over them generates lift Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings
primary feathers and secondary feathers Figure 2932 Primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and
provide thrust as the bird moves its wings downward using the pectoralis major muscles Secondary feathers
are located closer to the body in the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift In contrast to primary and
secondary feathers contour feathers are found on the body where they help reduce form drag produced by wind
resistance against the body during flight They create a smooth aerodynamic surface so that air moves swiftly
over the birds body preventing turbulence and creating ideal aerodynamic conditions for efficient flight

Flapping of the entire wing occurs primarily through the actions of the chest muscles Specifically the contraction
of the pectoralis major muscles moves the wings downward downstroke whereas contraction of the
supracoracoideus muscles moves the wings upward upstroke via a tough tendon that passes over the coracoid
bone and the top of the humerus Both muscles are attached to the keel of the sternum and these are the
muscles that humans eat on holidays this is why the back of the bird offers little meat These muscles are
highly developed in birds and account for a higher percentage of body mass than in most mammals The
flight muscles attach to a bladeshaped keel projecting ventrally from the sternum like the keel of a boat The
sternum of birds is deeper than that of other vertebrates which accommodates the large flight muscles The
flight muscles of birds who are active flyers are rich with oxygenstoring myoglobin Another skeletal modification
found in most birds is the fusion of the two clavicles collarbones forming the furcula or wishbone The furcula
is flexible enough to bend and provide support to the shoulder girdle during flapping
An important requirement for flight is a low body weight As body weight increases the muscle output required
for flying increases The largest living bird is the ostrich and while it is much smaller than the largest mammals it
is secondarily flightless For birds that do fly reduction in body weight makes flight easier Several modifications
are found in birds to reduce body weight including pneumatization of bones Pneumatic bones Figure 2933
are bones that are hollow rather than filled with tissue cross struts of bone called trabeculae provide structural
reinforcement Pneumatic bones are not found in all birds and they are more extensive in large birds than in
small birds Not all bones of the skeleton are pneumatic although the skulls of almost all birds are The jaw is
