Figure 329 A variety of chemical interactions determine the proteins tertiary structure These include hydrophobic
interactions ionic bonding hydrogen bonding and disulfide linkages
All of these interactions weak and strong determine the proteins final threedimensional shape When a protein
loses its threedimensional shape it may no longer be functional
Quaternary Structure
In nature some proteins form from several polypeptides or subunits and the interaction of these subunits forms
the quaternary structure Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure For
example insulin a globular protein has a combination of hydrogen and disulfide bonds that cause it to mostly
clump into a ball shape Insulin starts out as a single polypeptide and loses some internal sequences in the
presence of posttranslational modification after forming the disulfide linkages that hold the remaining chains
together Silk a fibrous protein however has a pleated sheet structure that is the result of hydrogen bonding
between different chains
Figure 330 illustrates the four levels of protein structure primary secondary tertiary and quaternary
