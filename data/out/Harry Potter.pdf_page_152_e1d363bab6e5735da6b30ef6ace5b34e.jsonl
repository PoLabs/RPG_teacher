Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him Seamus whispered
Cant have Hagrid said his voice shaking Cant nothing interfere
with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic  no kid could do that to
a Nimbus Two Thousand
At these words Hermione seized Hagrids binoculars but instead of
looking up at Harry she started looking frantically at the crowd
What are you doing moaned Ron grayfaced
I knew it Hermione gasped Snape  look
Ron grabbed the binoculars Snape was in the middle of the stands
opposite them He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop
under his breath
Hes doing something  jinxing the broom said Hermione
What should we do
Leave it to me
Before Ron could say another word Hermione had disappeared Ron turned
the binoculars back on Harry His broom was vibrating so hard it was
almost impossible for him to hang on much longer The whole crowd was on
its feet watching terrified as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull
Harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good  every time
they got near him the broom would jump higher still They dropped lower
and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell
Marcus
Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing
Come on Hermione Ron muttered desperately
Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood and
was now racing along the row behind him she didnt even stop to say
sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front
Reaching Snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a
few well chosen words Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the
hem of Snapes robes
