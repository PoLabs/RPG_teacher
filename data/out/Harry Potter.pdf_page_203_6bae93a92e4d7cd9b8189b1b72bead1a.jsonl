A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again
but it was only a second centaur blackhaired and bodied and
wilderlooking than Ronan
Hullo Bane said Hagrid All right
Good evening Hagrid I hope you are well
Well enough Look Ive jus bin askin Ronan you seen anythin odd in
here lately Theres a unicorn bin injured  would yeh know anythin
about it
Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan He looked skyward Mars is
bright tonight he said simply
Weve heard said Hagrid grumpily Well if either of you do see
anythin let me know wont yeh Well be off then
Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their
shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view
Never said Hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a
centaur Ruddy stargazers Not interested in anythin closern the
moon
Are there many of them in here asked Hermione
Oh a fair few Keep themselves to themselves mostly but theyre
good enough about turnin up if ever I want a word Theyre deep mind
centaurs they know things jus don let on much
Dyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier said Harry
Did that sound like hooves to you Nah if yeh ask me that was whats
bin killin the unicorns  never heard anythin like it before
They walked on through the dense dark trees Harry kept looking
nervously over his shoulder He had the nasty feeling they were being
watched He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them
They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrids
arm
Hagrid Look Red sparks the others are in trouble
