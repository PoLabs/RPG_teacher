Figure 2412 Zygomycete life cycle Zygomycetes have asexual and sexual phases in their life cycles In the asexual
phase spores are produced from haploid sporangia by mitosis not shown In the sexual phase plus and minus
haploid mating types conjugate to form a heterokaryotic zygosporangium Karyogamy then produces a diploid zygote
Diploid cells in the zygote undergo meiosis and germinate to form a haploid sporangium which releases the next
generation of haploid spores
