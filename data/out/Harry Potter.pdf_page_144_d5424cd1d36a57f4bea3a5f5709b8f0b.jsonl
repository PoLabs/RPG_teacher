his first match after weeks of training Gryffindor versus Slytherin If
Gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house
championship
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that as
their secret weapon Harry should be kept well secret But the news
that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow and Harry didnt know
which was worse  people telling him hed be brilliant or people
telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a mattress
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend He didnt
know how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what
with all the lastminute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do She
had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages which turned out to be a
very interesting read
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a
Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup
match in 1473 that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest
players and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to
them that although people rarely died playing Quidditch referees had
been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry
and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer
for it The day before Harrys first Quidditch match the three of them
were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured
them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar
They were standing with their backs to it getting warm when Snape
crossed the yard Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping Harry
Ron and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view
they were sure it wouldnt be allowed Unfortunately something about
their guilty faces caught Snapes eye He limped over He hadnt seen
the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off
anyway
Whats that youve got there Potter
It was Quidditch Through the Ages Harry showed him
Library books are not to be taken outside the school said Snape
Give it to me Five points from Gryffindor
