Geneticist
Many diseases arise from genetic mutations that prevent synthesizing critical proteins One such disease
is Lowe disease or oculocerebrorenal syndrome because it affects the eyes brain and kidneys In Lowe
disease there is a deficiency in an enzyme localized to the Golgi apparatus Children with Lowe disease
are born with cataracts typically develop kidney disease after the first year of life and may have impaired
mental abilities
A mutation on the X chromosome causes Lowe disease The X chromosome is one of the two human sex
chromosomes as these chromosomes determine a persons sex Females possess two X chromosomes
while males possess one X and one Y chromosome In females the genes on only one of the two X
chromosomes are expressed Females who carry the Lowe disease gene on one of their X chromosomes
are carriers and do not show symptoms of the disease However males only have one X chromosome and
the genes on this chromosome are always expressed Therefore males will always have Lowe disease if
their X chromosome carries the Lowe disease gene Geneticists have identified the mutated genes location
as well as many other mutation locations that cause genetic diseases Through prenatal testing a woman
can find out if the fetus she is carrying may be afflicted with one of several genetic diseases
Geneticists analyze prenatal genetic test results and may counsel pregnant women on available options
They may also conduct genetic research that leads to new drugs or foods or perform DNA analyses for
forensic investigations
Lysosomes
In addition to their role as the digestive component and organellerecycling facility of animal cells lysosomes
are part of the endomembrane system Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to destroy pathogens
diseasecausing organisms that might enter the cell A good example of this occurs in macrophages a group
of white blood cells which are part of your bodys immune system In a process that scientists call phagocytosis
or endocytosis a section of the macrophages plasma membrane invaginates folds in and engulfs a pathogen
The invaginated section with the pathogen inside then pinches itself off from the plasma membrane and
becomes a vesicle The vesicle fuses with a lysosome The lysosomes hydrolytic enzymes then destroy the
pathogen Figure 421
