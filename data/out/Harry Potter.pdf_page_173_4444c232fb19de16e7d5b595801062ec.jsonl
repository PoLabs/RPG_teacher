Weasleys who kept divebombing each other and pretending to fall off
their brooms
Will you stop messing around he yelled Thats exactly the sort of
thing thatll lose us the match Snapes refereeing this time and hell
be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words
Snapes refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud Whens
he ever refereed a Quidditch match Hes not going to be fair if we
might overtake Slytherin
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain too
Its not my fault said Wood Weve just got to make sure we play a
clean game so Snape hasnt got an excuse to pick on us
Which was all very well thought Harry but he had another reason for
not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the
end of practice but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common
room where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess Chess was the only
thing Hermione ever lost at something Harry and Ron thought was very
good for her
Dont talk to me for a moment said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him I need to concen  He caught sight of Harrys face Whats the
matter with you You look terrible
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear Harry told the other
two about Snapes sudden sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee
Dont play said Hermione at once
Say youre ill said Ron
Pretend to break your leg Hermione suggested
Really break your leg said Ron
I cant said Harry There isnt a reserve Seeker If I back out
