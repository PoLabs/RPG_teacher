Figure 3515 Communication at chemical synapses requires release of neurotransmitters When the presynaptic
membrane is depolarized voltagegated Ca2 channels open and allow Ca2 to enter the cell The calcium entry
causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane and release neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft
The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to ligandgated ion channels in the postsynaptic
membrane resulting in a localized depolarization or hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron
The binding of a specific neurotransmitter causes particular ion channels in this case ligandgated channels
on the postsynaptic membrane to open Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or inhibitory effects on the
postsynaptic membrane as detailed in Table 351 For example when acetylcholine is released at the synapse
between a nerve and muscle called the neuromuscular junction by a presynaptic neuron it causes postsynaptic
Na channels to open Na enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize
This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential EPSP and makes the postsynaptic neuron
more likely to fire an action potential Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials IPSPs a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane For example when the
