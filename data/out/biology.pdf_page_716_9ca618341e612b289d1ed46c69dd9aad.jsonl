Lignin also adds to the strength of these tissues in supporting the plant The vascular tissues extend into the
root of land plants The root system evolved to take up water and minerals from the soil and to anchor the
increasingly taller shoot in the soil
In land plants a waxy waterproof cover called a cuticle protects the leaves and stems from desiccation
However the cuticle also prevents intake of carbon dioxide needed for the synthesis of carbohydrates through
photosynthesis To overcome this stomata or pores that open and close to regulate traffic of gases and water
vapor appeared in plants as they moved away from moist environments into drier habitats
Water filters ultravioletB UVB light which is harmful to all organisms especially those that must absorb light
to survive This filtering does not occur for land plants Exposure to damaging radiation presented an additional
challenge to land colonization which was met by the evolution of biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of
protective flavonoids and other pigments that absorb UV wavelengths of light and protect the aerial parts of
plants from photodynamic damage
Plants cannot avoid being eaten by animals Instead they synthesize a large range of poisonous secondary
metabolites complex organic molecules such as alkaloids whose noxious smells and unpleasant taste deter
animals These toxic compounds can also cause severe diseases and even death thus discouraging predation
Humans have used many of these compounds for centuries as drugs medications or spices In contrast as
plants coevolved with animals the development of sweet and nutritious metabolites lured animals into providing
valuable assistance in dispersing pollen grains fruit or seeds Plants have been enlisting animals to be their
helpers in this way for hundreds of millions of years
Evolution of Land Plants
No discussion of the evolution of plants on land can be undertaken without a brief review of the timeline of the
geological eras The early era known as the Paleozoic is divided into six periods It starts with the Cambrian
period followed by the Ordovician Silurian Devonian Carboniferous and Permian The major event to mark
the Ordovician more than 500 million years ago was the colonization of land by the ancestors of modern land
plants Fossilized cells cuticles and spores of early land plants have been dated as far back as the Ordovician
period in the early Paleozoic era The oldestknown vascular plants have been identified in deposits from the
Devonian One of the richest sources of information is the Rhynie chert a sedimentary rock deposit found in
Rhynie Scotland Figure 255 where embedded fossils of some of the earliest vascular plants have been
identified

Paleobotanists distinguish between extinct species as fossils and extant species which are still living The
extinct vascular plants most probably lacked true leaves and roots and formed low vegetation mats similar
