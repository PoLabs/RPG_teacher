Building Phylogenetic Trees
How do scientists construct phylogenetic trees After they sort the homologous and analogous traits scientists
often organize the homologous traits using cladistics This system sorts organisms into clades groups of
organisms that descended from a single ancestor For example in Figure 2010 all the organisms in the
orange region evolved from a single ancestor that had amniotic eggs Consequently these organisms also have
amniotic eggs and make a single clade or a monophyletic group Clades must include all descendants from a
branch point
Figure 2010 Lizards rabbits and humans all descend from a common ancestor that had an amniotic egg Thus
lizards rabbits and humans all belong to the clade Amniota Vertebrata is a larger clade that also includes fish
and lamprey
Which animals in this figure belong to a clade that includes animals with hair Which evolved first hair or
the amniotic egg
Clades can vary in size depending on which branch point one references The important factor is that all
organisms in the clade or monophyletic group stem from a single point on the tree You can remember
this because monophyletic breaks down into mono meaning one and phyletic meaning evolutionary
relationship Figure 2011 shows various clade examples Notice how each clade comes from a single point
whereas the nonclade groups show branches that do not share a single point
