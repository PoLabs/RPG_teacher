fail to detect errors present in the genomic DNA Figure 1014 Even if a partially functional p53 does identify
the mutations it may no longer be able to signal the necessary DNA repair enzymes Either way damaged DNA
will remain uncorrected At this point a functional p53 will deem the cell unsalvageable and trigger programmed
cell death apoptosis The damaged version of p53 found in cancer cells however cannot trigger apoptosis
Figure 1014 The role of normal p53 is to monitor DNA and the supply of oxygen hypoxia is a condition of reduced
oxygen supply If damage is detected p53 triggers repair mechanisms If repairs are unsuccessful p53 signals
apoptosis A cell with an abnormal p53 protein cannot repair damaged DNA and thus cannot signal apoptosis
Cells with abnormal p53 can become cancerous credit modification of work by Thierry Soussi
Human papillomavirus can cause cervical cancer The virus encodes E6 a protein that binds p53 Based
on this fact and what you know about p53 what effect do you think E6 binding has on p53 activity
a
E6 activates p53
b
E6 inactivates p53
c
E6 mutates p53
d
E6 binding marks p53 for degradation
The loss of p53 function has other repercussions for the cell cycle Mutated p53 might lose its ability to trigger
p21 production Without adequate levels of p21 there is no effective block on Cdk activation Essentially without
a fully functional p53 the G1 checkpoint is severely compromised and the cell proceeds directly from G1 to
S regardless of internal and external conditions At the completion of this shortened cell cycle two daughter
cells are produced that have inherited the mutated p53 gene Given the nonoptimal conditions under which the
parent cell reproduced it is likely that the daughter cells will have acquired other mutations in addition to the
faulty tumorsuppressor gene Cells such as these daughter cells quickly accumulate both oncogenes and non
functional tumorsuppressor genes Again the result is tumor growth
