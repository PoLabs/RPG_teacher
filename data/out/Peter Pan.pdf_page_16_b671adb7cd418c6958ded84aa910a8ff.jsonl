But she was exulting in his ignorance I shall sew it on for you
my little man she said though he was tall as herself and she got
out her housewife and sewed the shadow on to Peters foot
I daresay it will hurt a little she warned him
Oh I shant cry said Peter who was already of the opinion that
he had never cried in his life And he clenched his teeth and did not
cry and soon his shadow was behaving properly though still a little
creased
Perhaps I should have ironed it Wendy said thoughtfully but
Peter boylike was indifferent to appearances and he was now
jumping about in the wildest glee Alas he had already forgotten that
he owed his bliss to Wendy He thought he had attached the shadow
himself How clever I am he crowed rapturously oh the
