arising from an adult plant or plant parts it will also be sturdier than a seedling Asexual reproduction can take
place by natural or artificial assisted by humans means
Natural Methods of Asexual Reproduction
Natural methods of asexual reproduction include strategies that plants have developed to selfpropagate Many
plantslike ginger onion gladioli and dahliacontinue to grow from buds that are present on the surface of
the stem In some plants such as the sweet potato adventitious roots or runners can give rise to new plants
Figure 3225 In Bryophyllum and kalanchoe the leaves have small buds on their margins When these are
detached from the plant they grow into independent plants or they may start growing into independent plants if
the leaf touches the soil Some plants can be propagated through cuttings alone
Figure 3225 A stolon or runner is a stem that runs along the ground At the nodes it forms adventitious roots and
buds that grow into a new plant
Artificial Methods of Asexual Reproduction
These methods are frequently employed to give rise to new and sometimes novel plants They include grafting
cutting layering and micropropagation
Grafting
Grafting has long been used to produce novel varieties of roses citrus species and other plants In grafting
two plant species are used part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock
The part that is grafted or attached is called the scion Both are cut at an oblique angle any angle other than
a right angle placed in close contact with each other and are then held together Figure 3226 Matching up
these two surfaces as closely as possible is extremely important because these will be holding the plant together
The vascular systems of the two plants grow and fuse forming a graft After a period of time the scion starts
producing shoots and eventually starts bearing flowers and fruits Grafting is widely used in viticulture grape
growing and the citrus industry Scions capable of producing a particular fruit variety are grafted onto root stock
with specific resistance to disease
