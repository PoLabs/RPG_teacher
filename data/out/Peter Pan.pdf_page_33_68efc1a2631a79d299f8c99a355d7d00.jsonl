All are keeping a sharp lookout in front but none suspects that
the danger may be creeping up from behind This shows how real the
island was
The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys They flung
themselves down on the sward close to their underground home
I do wish Peter would come back every one of them said
nervously though in height and still more in breadth they were all
larger than their captain
I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates Slightly said
in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite but perhaps
some distant sound disturbed him for he added hastily but I wish
he would come back and tell us whether he has heard anything more
about Cinderella
They talked of Cinderella and Tootles was confident that his
mother must have been very like her
It was only in Peters absence that they could speak of mothers
the subject being forbidden by him as silly
All I remember about my mother Nibs told them is that she
often said to my father Oh how I wish I had a chequebook of my
own I dont know what a chequebook is but I should just love to
give my mother one
While they talked they heard a distant sound You or I not being
wild things of the woods would have heard nothing but they heard
it and it was the grim song
Yo ho yo ho the pirate life
The flag o skull and bones
A merry hour a hempen rope
And hey for Davy Jones
At once the lost boysbut where are they They are no longer
there Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly
I will tell you where they are With the exception of Nibs who has
darted away to reconnoitre they are already in their home under the
ground a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal
presently But how have they reached it for there is no entrance to
be seen not so much as a large stone which if rolled away would
disclose the mouth of a cave Look closely however and you may
note that there are here seven large trees each with a hole in its
hollow trunk as large as a boy These are the seven entrances to the
home under the ground for which Hook has been searching in vain
these many moons Will he find it tonight
As the pirates advanced the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs
disappearing through the wood and at once his pistol flashed out
But an iron claw gripped his shoulder
Captain let go he cried writhing
Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook It was a black
voice Put back that pistol first it said threateningly
It was one of those boys you hate I could have shot him dead
Ay and the sound would have brought Tiger Lilys redskins upon
us Do you want to lose your scalp
