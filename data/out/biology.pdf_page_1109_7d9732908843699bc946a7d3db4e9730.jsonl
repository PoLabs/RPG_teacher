Other symptoms of ASD include repetitive motor behaviors such as rocking back and forth preoccupation with
specific subjects strict adherence to certain rituals and unusual language use Up to 30 percent of patients
with ASD develop epilepsy and patients with some forms of the disorder like Fragile X also have intellectual
disability Because it is a spectrum disorder other ASD patients are very functional and have goodtoexcellent
language skills Many of these patients do not feel that they suffer from a disorder and instead think that their
brains just process information differently
Except for some wellcharacterized clearly genetic forms of autism like Fragile X and Retts Syndrome the
causes of ASD are largely unknown Variants of several genes correlate with the presence of ASD but for
any given patient many different mutations in different genes may be required for the disease to develop At
a general level ASD is thought to be a disease of incorrect wiring Accordingly brains of some ASD patients
lack the same level of synaptic pruning that occurs in nonaffected people In the 1990s a research paper linked
autism to a common vaccine given to children This paper was retracted when it was discovered that the author
falsified data and followup studies showed no connection between vaccines and autism
Treatment for autism usually combines behavioral therapies and interventions along with medications to treat
other disorders common to people with autism depression anxiety obsessive compulsive disorder Although
early interventions can help mitigate the effects of the disease there is currently no cure for ASD
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD
Approximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected by attention deficithyperactivity
disorder ADHD Like ASD ADHD is more prevalent in males than females Symptoms of the disorder
include inattention lack of focus executive functioning difficulties impulsivity and hyperactivity beyond what
is characteristic of the normal developmental stage Some patients do not have the hyperactive component
of symptoms and are diagnosed with a subtype of ADHD attention deficit disorder ADD Many people
with ADHD also show comorbitity in that they develop secondary disorders in addition to ADHD Examples
include depression or obsessive compulsive disorder OCD Figure 3532 provides some statistics concerning
comorbidity with ADHD
The cause of ADHD is unknown although research points to a delay and dysfunction in the development of the
prefrontal cortex and disturbances in neurotransmission According to studies of twins the disorder has a strong
genetic component There are several candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder but no definitive links
have been discovered Environmental factors including exposure to certain pesticides may also contribute to
the development of ADHD in some patients Treatment for ADHD often involves behavioral therapies and the
prescription of stimulant medications which paradoxically cause a calming effect in these patients
