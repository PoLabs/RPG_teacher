removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy His seizures went away but he could no longer form new memories
although he could remember some facts from before his surgery and could learn new motor tasks
Cerebral Cortex
Compared to other vertebrates mammals have exceptionally large brains for their body size An entire
alligators brain for example would fill about one and a half teaspoons This increase in brain to body
size ratio is especially pronounced in apes whales and dolphins While this increase in overall brain size
doubtlessly played a role in the evolution of complex behaviors unique to mammals it does not tell the
whole story Scientists have found a relationship between the relatively high surface area of the cortex and
the intelligence and complex social behaviors exhibited by some mammals This increased surface area is
due in part to increased folding of the cortical sheet more sulci and gyri For example a rat cortex is very
smooth with very few sulci and gyri Cat and sheep cortices have more sulci and gyri Chimps humans and
dolphins have even more
Figure 3523 Mammals have larger braintobody ratios than other vertebrates Within mammals increased
cortical folding and surface area is correlated with complex behavior
Basal Ganglia
Interconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia or basal nuclei shown in Figure 3520b play important
roles in movement control and posture Damage to the basal ganglia as in Parkinsons disease leads to motor
impairments like a shuffling gait when walking The basal ganglia also regulate motivation For example when a
wasp sting led to bilateral basal ganglia damage in a 25yearold businessman he began to spend all his days in
bed and showed no interest in anything or anybody But when he was externally stimulatedas when someone
asked to play a card game with himhe was able to function normally Interestingly he and other similar patients
do not report feeling bored or frustrated by their state
Thalamus
The thalamus Greek for inner chamber illustrated in Figure 3524 acts as a gateway to and from the cortex
It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex This feedback
mechanism can modulate conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the attention and
arousal state of the animal The thalamus helps regulate consciousness arousal and sleep states A rare
genetic disorder called fatal familial insomnia causes the degeneration of thalamic neurons and glia This
disorder prevents affected patients from being able to sleep among other symptoms and is eventually fatal
