Minority Issues and Policies During and After the Cold 
War
Although states in postwar Central and Eastern Europe perceptibly worked 
towards the greatest possible degree of homogeneity several countries retained 
a multiethnic character andor ethnic minorities after 1945 Policies regarding 
minorities varied from state to state and from period from period After the 
communist takeover the Marxist doctrine of proletarian internationalism to 
some extent relegated minority issues into the background but ethnic realities 
still had to be addressed The USSR was itself a multiethnic state in which 
contradictory policies coexisted While Russification and the suppression of 
local nationalisms was a marked tendency during the entire history of the Soviet 
Union so too was a whole range of working solutions developed with regard 
to the languages of member republics and the historic and cultural heritage 
of nonRussian nationalities The countries of the Socialist Bloc were required 
to adopt the principles of proletarian internationalism but at the same time 
they could look to the Soviet Union for practical examples of how to handle 
nationalities within a multiethnic communist state In some eastcentral 
European communist countries such as Hungary and Yugoslavia the equality 
of all nationalities was stated in the constitution in others Czechoslovakia for

such as schools cultural associations organisations events newspapers 
or regular radio and television programmes these were closely monitored 
and kept under strict state control The case of the Roma in Czechoslovakia 
is illustrative of the contradictory approach toward minority groups under 
socialism On the one hand the state pursued assimilation strategies premised 
on the idea that the Roma did not constitute a distinct nationality but rather 
represented a kind of deviant lifestyle or a social problem for the state Measures 
deployed against the Roma included not only continuous sedentarisation and 
resettlement from the countryside of eastern Slovakia to cities in the border 
regions of Bohemia but also much more aggressive policies such as the 
sterilisation of Roma women or segregation of Roma children into special 
schools On the other hand the proclamations of equality and extensive social 
rights that legitimised the socialist regime also created a space for advocating
