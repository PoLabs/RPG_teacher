Evolution of Gene Regulation
Prokaryotic cells can only regulate gene expression by controlling the amount of transcription As eukaryotic
cells evolved the complexity of the control of gene expression increased For example with the evolution
of eukaryotic cells came compartmentalization of important cellular components and cellular processes A
nuclear region that contains the DNA was formed Transcription and translation were physically separated
into two different cellular compartments It therefore became possible to control gene expression by
regulating transcription in the nucleus and also by controlling the RNA levels and protein translation present
outside the nucleus
Most gene regulation is done to conserve cell resources However other regulatory processes may be
defensive Cellular processes such as developed to protect the cell from viral or parasitic infections If the
cell could quickly shut off gene expression for a short period of time it would be able to survive an infection
when other organisms could not Therefore the organism evolved a new process that helped it survive and
it was able to pass this new development to offspring
162  Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the steps involved in prokaryotic gene regulation

Explain the roles of activators inducers and repressors in gene regulation
The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled within the nucleoid region of the
cell cytoplasm Proteins that are needed for a specific function or that are involved in the same biochemical
pathway are encoded together in blocks called operons For example all of the genes needed to use lactose
as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose or lac operon and transcribed into a single
mRNA
In prokaryotic cells there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons
repressors activators and inducers Repressors and activators are proteins produced in the cell Both
repressors and activators regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sites adjacent to the genes they
control In general activators bind to the promoter site while repressors bind to operator regions Repressors
prevent transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus whereas activators increase the
transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus Inducers are small molecules that may be produced
by the cell or that are in the cells environment Inducers either activate or repress transcription depending on
the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate
The trp Operon A Repressible Operon
Bacteria such as Escherichia coli need amino acids to survive and are able to synthesize many of them
Tryptophan is one such amino acid that E coli can either ingest from the environment or synthesize using
enzymes that are encoded by five genes These five genes are next to each other in what is called the
tryptophan trp operon Figure 163 The genes are transcribed into a single mRNA which is then translated
to produce all five enzymes If tryptophan is present in the environment then E coli does not need to synthesize
it and the trp operon is switched off However when tryptophan availability is low the switch controlling
the operon is turned on the mRNA is transcribed the enzyme proteins are translated and tryptophan is
synthesized
