and can reproduce asexually by budding or fragmentation or sexually by producing gametes Male or female
gametes produced by a polyp fuse to give rise to a freeswimming planula larva The larva settles on a suitable
substratum and develops into a sessile polyp
Class Scyphozoa
Class Scyphozoa cup animals includes all and only the marine jellies with about 200 known species The
medusa is the prominent stage in the life cycle although there is a polyp stage in the life cycle of most species
Most jellies range from 2 to 40 cm in length but the largest scyphozoan species Cyanea capillata can reach a
size of two meters in diameter Scyphozoans display a characteristic belllike morphology Figure 289

In the sea jelly a mouth opening is present on the underside of the animal surrounded by hollow tentacles
bearing nematocysts Scyphozoans live most of their life cycle as freeswimming solitary carnivores The mouth
leads to the gastrovascular cavity which may be sectioned into four interconnected sacs called diverticuli In
some species the digestive system may branch further into radial canals Like the septa in anthozoans the
branched gastrovascular cells serve two functions to increase the surface area for nutrient absorption and
diffusion and to support the body of the animal
In scyphozoans nerve cells are organized in a nerve net that extends over the entire body with a nerve ring
around the edge of the bell Clusters of sensory organs called rhopalia may be present in pockets in the edge of
the bell Jellies have a ring of muscles lining the dome of the body which provides the contractile force required
to swim through water as well as to draw in food from the water as they swim Scyphozoans have separate
sexes The gonads are formed from the gastrodermis and gametes are expelled through the mouth Planula
larvae are formed by external fertilization they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form These polyps may
bud to form additional polyps or begin immediately to produce medusa buds In a few species the planula larva
may develop directly into the medusa The life cycle Figure 2810 of most scyphozoans includes both sexual
medusoid and asexual polypoid body forms
