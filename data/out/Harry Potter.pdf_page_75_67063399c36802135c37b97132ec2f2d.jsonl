Aaah has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie said one of the
twins
Shut up said Ron
Wheres Percy said their mother
Hes coming now
The oldest boy came striding into sight He had already changed into his
billowing black Hogwarts robes and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge
on his chest with the letter P on it
Cant stay long Mother he said Im up front the prefects have got
two compartments to themselves 
Oh are you a prefect Percy said one of the twins with an air of
great surprise You should have said something we had no idea
Hang on I think I remember him saying something about it said the
other twin Once 
Or twice 
A minute 
All summer 
Oh shut up said Percy the Prefect
How come Percy gets new robes anyway said one of the twins
Because hes a prefect said their mother fondly All right dear
well have a good term  send me an owl when you get there
She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left Then she turned to the twins
Now you two  this year you behave yourselves If I get one more owl
telling me youve  youve blown up a toilet or 
Blown up a toilet Weve never blown up a toilet
