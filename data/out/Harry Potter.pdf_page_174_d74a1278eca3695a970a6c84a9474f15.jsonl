Gryffindor cant play at all
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room How he had managed
to climb through the portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs
had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the
LegLocker Curse He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to
Gryffindor tower
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione who leapt up and performed
the countercurse Nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his feet
trembling What happened Hermione asked him leading him over to sit
with Harry and Ron
Malfoy said Neville shakily I met him outside the library He said
hed been looking for someone to practice that on
Go to Professor McGonagall Hermione urged Neville Report him
Neville shook his head
I dont want more trouble he mumbled
Youve got to stand up to him Neville said Ron Hes used to
walking all over people but thats no reason to lie down in front of
him and make it easier
Theres no need to tell me Im not brave enough to be in Gryffindor
Malfoys already done that Neville choked out
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog
the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas He
gave it to Neville who looked as though he might cry
Youre worth twelve of Malfoy Harry said The Sorting Hat chose you
for Gryffindor didnt it And wheres Malfoy In stinking Slytherin
Nevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog
Thanks Harry I think Ill go to bed Dyou want the card you
collect them dont you
As Neville walked away Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card
