UNIT 3 POWER AND CITIZENSHIP

the participation of a segment of the colonised populations In some territories 
the colonisers had recourse to traditional indigenous elites Indian Princes 
Rajahs and Maharajas Javanese bupatis or priyayis African chiefs and kings 
with varying degrees of autonomy to collect taxes requisition men for forced 
labour and maintain social peace In others they enlisted intermediaries 
educated natives volus assimilados to perform subaltern functions in 
the colonial administration interpreters secretaries guards 
However colonial rule was coercive in many ways and for various reasons 
Firstly the agents of the colonial authority concentrated all kind of powers 
legislative executive judicial and financial and enjoyed a certain autonomy 
from the imperial governments because of the remoteness of the metropolis 
This led to widespread abuse of power and outbursts of violence such as the 
Congo scandals under both the French and the direct rule of Belgian King 
Leopold II caused by forced labourintensive requisitions at the time of the 
rubber boom in the early twentieth century Secondly the systemic violence 
of the colonial policing can be explained by the populations absence of 
consent to the colonial order some historians consider it a symptom of a weak 
state Third the extraction of revenue and men through the levying of taxes 
crops labour or conscripts was a primary function of colonial rule which 
could not be implemented without coercion Colonial administrators found 
racialist or paternalistic justifications for it in colonial ideology it was a matter 
of putting to work indolent populations who were in their view incapable 
of extracting resources from their land beyond the satisfaction of their vital 
needs And when part of these functions was entrusted to indigenous elites 
the consequent violence was no less harsh Finally colonial administrations 
put in place exceptional legislation that ensured both the maintenance of 
colonial order and the proper functioning of the extractive policies the status 
of indigene or colonial subject was both that of a subaltern in a system of social 
and racial domination and a legal status that subjected the individual to rules 
and punishments particular to the colony
The socalled civilising mission a wellknown element of colonial 
ideology generated paradoxical effects Indeed its effective application would 
have rendered the maintenance of domination irrelevant and futureless since 
the Europeans could no longer invoke their alleged superiority The means 
put into education were therefore very limited in Algeria only 45 percent 
of Muslim children were enrolled in school in 1907 and in India one in 100 
inhabitants spoke English in the 1920s Secondary education was limited to 
a handful of individuals and scholarships to study at university usually in 
the imperial capitals were issued sparingly Officials feared that they were 
producing uprooted individuals who would no longer have a place in their 
native society and would believe themselves to be the equals of Europeans
