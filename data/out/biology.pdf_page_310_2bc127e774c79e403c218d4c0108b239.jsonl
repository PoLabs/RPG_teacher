KEY TERMS
stage of mitosis during which sister chromatids are separated from each other
prokaryotic cell division process
ordered sequence of events through which a cell passes between one cell division and the next
ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells
structure formed during plant cell cytokinesis by Golgi vesicles forming a temporary structure
phragmoplast and fusing at the metaphase plate ultimately leads to the formation of cell walls that
separate the two daughter cells
mechanism that monitors the preparedness of a eukaryotic cell to advance through the
various cellcycle stages
rodlike structure constructed of microtubules at the center of each animal cell centrosome
region at which sister chromatids are bound together a constricted area in condensed
chromosomes
single DNA molecule of two strands of duplicated DNA and associated proteins held together at the
centromere
constriction formed by an actin ring during cytokinesis in animal cells that leads to cytoplasmic
division
proteins that help sister chromatids coil during prophase
one of a group of proteins that act in conjunction with cyclindependent kinases to help regulate the cell
cycle by phosphorylating key proteins the concentrations of cyclins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle
one of a group of protein kinases that helps to regulate the cell cycle when
bound to cyclin it functions to phosphorylate other proteins that are either activated or inactivated by
phosphorylation
division of the cytoplasm following mitosis that forms two daughter cells
cell nucleus or organism containing two sets of chromosomes 2n
tubulinlike protein component of the prokaryotic cytoskeleton that is important in prokaryotic cytokinesis
name origin Filamenting temperaturesensitive mutant Z
distinct from the G1 phase of interphase a cell in G0 is not preparing to divide
also first gap first phase of interphase centered on cell growth during mitosis
also second gap third phase of interphase during which the cell undergoes final preparations for
mitosis
haploid reproductive cell or sex cell sperm pollen grain or egg
physical and functional unit of heredity a sequence of DNA that codes for a protein
total genetic information of a cell or organism
cell nucleus or organism containing one set of chromosomes n
one of several similar highly conserved low molecular weight basic proteins found in the chromatin of
all eukaryotic cells associates with DNA to form nucleosomes
chromosomes of the same morphology with genes in the same location diploid
