and later Germany faced difficulties in pursuing national railway policies 
associated with the demands of private companies and the diverging policies 
of the many German states In the end especially after 1870 military interests 
drove both countries to outdo each other in terms of the absolute length and 
relative density of their railway networks 
Despite such efforts towards nationbuilding however technology 
contributed significantly to the gradual formation of Europe as a cultural and 
economic unit The international standardisation of national communication 
and transport networks enabled a growing intensity of contact between 
European regions and peoples The Bern Convention of 1886 offers a good 
example of such cooperation Until then Europe had been divided by the 
Alps into three largely incompatible railway networks roughly French 
Italian and German Construction of a transalpine connection interlinking 
the three networks required harmonisation between the differing standards 
and in that regard the Bern Convention was a success Prior to the First 
World War a unique European railway regulatory regime was developed 
combining various national commercial and nongovernmental bodies and 
institutions This system would manage an efficient operation of rolling stock 
on the network extending from the Atlantic to Russia Standards developed in 
Europe often became universal standards and found application around the

Europeans in the long nineteenth century particularly those living in urban 
areas experienced an unprecedented technological transformation of their 
work and everyday lives Changes ranged from the sewing machine to the 
rise of the factory workplace from the systematic construction expansion 
and maintenance of sewers to the gasification and electrification of the main 
streets and the development of urban public transport In rural areas changes 
consisted mainly of the growing possibilities of commercialising agricultural 
goods stemming from new and improved infrastructures roads railways 
steamships that expanded the range of foodstuffs that could be sold for 
profit in faraway places Railways and steamships became the fetishes of 
the century symbols of the progress of civilisation They fostered commerce 
and facilitated the spread of revolutionary ideas diseases such as cholera as 
well as massive European migration to America At the same time they were 
tools of imperialism that helped governments to get a tighter grip on their 
territories in Europe and beyond The infamous term gunboat diplomacy 
linked to European and US imperialism points to the less benign aspects of
