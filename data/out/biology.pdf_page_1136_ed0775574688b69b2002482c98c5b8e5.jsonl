Figure 3613 Sound travels through the outer ear to the middle ear which is bounded on its exterior by the tympanic
membrane The middle ear contains three bones called ossicles that transfer the sound wave to the oval window the
exterior boundary of the inner ear The organ of Corti which is the organ of sound transduction lies inside the cochlea
Transduction of Sound
Vibrating objects such as vocal cords create sound waves or pressure waves in the air When these pressure
waves reach the ear the ear transduces this mechanical stimulus pressure wave into a nerve impulse
electrical signal that the brain perceives as sound The pressure waves strike the tympanum causing it to
vibrate The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the
middle ear The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window which is the
outermost structure of the inner ear The structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth a bony hollow
structure that is the most interior portion of the ear Here the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the
stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea The vibrations of the oval window create
pressure waves in the fluid perilymph inside the cochlea The cochlea is a whorled structure like the shell of
a snail and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal as illustrated
in Figure 3614 Inside the cochlea the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the
cochlea curling toward the cochleas center
The mechanical properties of the basilar membrane change along its length such that it is thicker tauter and
narrower at the outside of the whorl where the cochlea is largest and thinner floppier and broader toward the
apex or center of the whorl where the cochlea is smallest Different regions of the basilar membrane vibrate
according to the frequency of the sound wave conducted through the fluid in the cochlea For these reasons the
fluidfilled cochlea detects different wave frequencies pitches at different regions of the membrane When the
sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar membrane it flexes back and forth in a wavelike fashion
Above the basilar membrane is the tectorial membrane
