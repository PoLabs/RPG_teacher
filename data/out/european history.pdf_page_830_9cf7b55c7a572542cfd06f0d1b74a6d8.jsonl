interwar period The Roaring Twenties also saw the rise of new youth cultures 
in welloff circles the socalled Bright Young Things but also more popular 
groups swing and jazz fans as well as new forms of womens emancipation 
in the form of the cocalled flappers The ideological indoctrination of young 
people was a central feature of interwar totalitarian regimes which founded 
new compulsory youth movements such as the Hitler Youth in Germany 
Balilla in Italy or Komsomol in the USSRthough eliminating all dissident 
groups for example the Edelweiss Pirates in Germany was never a complete 
success
The Second World War disrupted intergenerational relationships In 
Britain 800000 children were evacuated from urban areas to escape the Blitz 
In Germany tens of thousands of Trmmerjugend literally rubble youths 
many of them war orphans resorted to the black market and petty crimes in 
order to survive At the beginning of the 1950s most youth movements were 
on the declineexcept in Eastern and Central Europe for example the Free

unprecedented increase of their purchasing power and became a new target 
for consumer and cultural industries Clothes miniskirts records rock n 
roll radio shows Salut les copains in France 1959 magazines Bravo in West 
Germany 1956 and movies The Wild Ones 1954 Rebel Without a Cause 1955 
were specifically aimed at the new Americanised generation Youth culture 
also instigated new uses of space and leisure time Young people would meet 
in coffee bars all the more popular when equipped with a jukebox and pinball 
machine or dancing and music venues like The Marquee in London and the 
Golf Drouot in Paris but also at funfairs amusement piers stadiums or more 
simply in the local square Young girls often more strictly monitored than 
their male counterparts would develop a specific bedroom culture centred
