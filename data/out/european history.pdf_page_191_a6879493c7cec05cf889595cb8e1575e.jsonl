Jewish identity strict segregation was a concern for Christians and to some 
extent for Jews themselves
Segregationist measures came to an unprecedented climax with the 
expulsion of the Sephardic Jews from Spain in 1492 after the conquest of 
Granada then the last remaining Islamic kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula 
the Spanish monarchs sought to homogenise their ethnically and religiously 
highly diverse subject populations Sephardic Jews faced the choice of either 
baptism or execution if they refused to leave Spain A similar measure in 1609
