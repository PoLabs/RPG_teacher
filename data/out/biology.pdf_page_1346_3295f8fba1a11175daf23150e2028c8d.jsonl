fertilization Seahorses like the one shown in Figure 431 provide an example of the latter Following a mating
dance the female lays eggs in the male seahorses abdominal brood pouch where they are fertilized The eggs
hatch and the offspring develop in the pouch for several weeks
431  Reproduction Methods
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe advantages and disadvantages of asexual and sexual reproduction

Discuss asexual reproduction methods

Discuss sexual reproduction methods
Animals produce offspring through asexual andor sexual reproduction Both methods have advantages and
disadvantages Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because
the offspring are all clones of the original parent A single individual can produce offspring asexually and large
numbers of offspring can be produced quickly In a stable or predictable environment asexual reproduction is
an effective means of reproduction because all the offspring will be adapted to that environment In an unstable
or unpredictable environment asexuallyreproducing species may be at a disadvantage because all the offspring
are genetically identical and may not have the genetic variation to survive in new or different conditions On the
other hand the rapid rates of asexual reproduction may allow for a speedy response to environmental changes if
individuals have mutations An additional advantage of asexual reproduction is that colonization of new habitats
may be easier when an individual does not need to find a mate to reproduce
During sexual reproduction the genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse
offspring that differ from their parents The genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is thought to give
species a better chance of surviving in an unpredictable or changing environment Species that reproduce
sexually must maintain two different types of individuals males and females which can limit the ability to
colonize new habitats as both sexes must be present
Asexual Reproduction
Asexual reproduction occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms bacteria and in some eukaryotic singlecelled and
multicelled organisms There are a number of ways that animals reproduce asexually
Fission
Fission also called binary fission occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate multicelled
organisms After a period of growth an organism splits into two separate organisms Some unicellular eukaryotic
organisms undergo binary fission by mitosis In other organisms part of the individual separates and forms
a second individual This process occurs for example in many asteroid echinoderms through splitting of the
central disk Some sea anemones and some coral polyps Figure 432 also reproduce through fission
