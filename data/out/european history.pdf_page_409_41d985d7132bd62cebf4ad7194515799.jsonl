against Germany in 1870 following rituals far removed from the triumphalist 
monuments and ceremonies of the Napoleonic Wars Immediately after the 
First World War countless memorials were erected in towns and villages to 
represent the multifaceted memories of war and to bind these memories to 
the experience of combatants on the home front This was taken a step further 
with the cult of the unknown soldier whose tomb was placed beneath the Arc 
de Triomphe in Paris in January 1921 imitating the initiative at Westminster 
Abbey London in 1919 Managing the memories of war became vital in the 
process of reconciliation for a mourning nation and thus became an issue for 
both state and society
In Germany after the First World War there were an increasing number 
of military parades by Steel Helmets Denial of the defeat andeven more 
importantlyof responsibility for the war prevented the construction of a 
minimal consensus around memory of the war The tomb of the unknown 
soldier was only erected in 1931 in the courtyard of the Neue Wache building 
in Berlin In 1927 a memorial to the Battle of Tannenberg was erected in 
Eastern Prussia providing a substitute narrative to defeat on the Western 
Front It became a monument for those nostalgic for empire and a site where 
paramilitary groups maintained a heroic and positive vision of the war With 
worship of the dead thus monopolised by a few groups the only place left to 
pay homage to the dead was within the church 
In addition to political instrumentalisation of war memory by different 
regimes populations themselves also have their own multiple memories of 
the experience of war Thus in post1945 France various memories coexisted 
simultaneously the Resistance deportation the first liberated colonies 
combatants civilians supporters of the Vichy regime Nazi collaborators 
These multiple memories were not all expressed equally within society nor 
through the same channels Overall victimisation nevertheless provided a 
way of unifying the population around a set of coherent memories Through 
to the 1970s Gaullism and communism deployed a resistancialist vision of the 
war which presented the majority of the French as resisting Nazism
Yet memories of the traumas of war may long remain dormant They 
erupted in Western Europe in the 1980s and in Central Europe after the Berlin 
Wall came down Memories of the Shoah provoked numerous conflicts in the 
following decades with marked contrasts between the West and the East of 
the continent Equally memories of the aerial bombing in Germany during 
the Second World War reemerged at a later date not triggering debate until 
the 2000s once the country had been reunified Lastly memories of colonial 
wars are still painful and remain largely undealt with by states in France 
memories of the Algerian War 19541962 fuel a feeling of unease which 
undermines national cohesion In 2021 recognising the abuses committed in
