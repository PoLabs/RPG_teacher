303  Roots
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify the two types of root systems

Describe the three zones of the root tip and summarize the role of each zone in root growth

Describe the structure of the root

List and describe examples of modified roots
The roots of seed plants have three major functions anchoring the plant to the soil absorbing water and minerals
and transporting them upwards and storing the products of photosynthesis Some roots are modified to absorb
moisture and exchange gases Most roots are underground Some plants however also have adventitious
roots which emerge above the ground from the shoot
Types of Root Systems
Root systems are mainly of two types Figure 3015 Dicots have a tap root system while monocots have a
fibrous root system A tap root system has a main root that grows down vertically and from which many smaller
lateral roots arise Dandelions are a good example their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these
weeds and they can regrow another shoot from the remaining root A tap root system penetrates deep into the
soil In contrast a fibrous root system is located closer to the soil surface and forms a dense network of roots
that also helps prevent soil erosion lawn grasses are a good example as are wheat rice and corn Some
plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots Plants that grow in dry areas often have deep root
systems whereas plants growing in areas with abundant water are likely to have shallower root systems

Root Growth and Anatomy
Root growth begins with seed germination When the plant embryo emerges from the seed the radicle of the
embryo forms the root system The tip of the root is protected by the root cap a structure exclusive to roots
and unlike any other plant structure The root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as
the root pushes through soil The root tip can be divided into three zones a zone of cell division a zone of
