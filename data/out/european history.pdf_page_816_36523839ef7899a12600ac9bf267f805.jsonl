moment of their marriage In early modern societies with relatively low life 
expectancy this period of youth took up a huge portion of peoples lives This 
was especially the case in more prosperous and urban parts of Europe where 
people married at relatively old ages
Historical research from the late twentieth century onwards has been 
partly dedicated to the adult construction of youth a life stage which adults 
increasingly associated with the need for control and guidance from young 
elites while keeping potentially dangerous lowerclass youth in check 
Scholars also pointed at young peoples potential to shape their own identity 
for instance by means of peer group interaction Although youth culture is a 
contested phenomenon for early modern Europe it is known that groups of 
youths were able to set their own subcultures at least in an informal way
This phenomenon of informal group and identity formation has been 
studied with regard to upperclass male youths in the early seventeenth
century Dutch Republic which is known for its rapid artistic intellectual and 
economic flourishing Profiting from the prosperity of their families young 
men created a shared identity by means of distinct clothing silk and metallic 
embellishments bright colours as well as long hair and moustaches and 
found a shared pastime in the consumption of luxurious illustrated songbooks 
widely published on the commercialising book market of the Dutch Republic 
The collective activity of singing and drinking helped them to define what it 
meant to be a growing man Historian Benjamin Roberts 2012 has compared 
these adolescents to young people in the 1960s provocatively defining their 
lives as ones of sex and drugs before rock n roll 
Although the Dutch Republic seems to have been a particularly fruitful 
breeding ground for a flourishing youth culture that was clearly inflected 
by gender and class difference such youth culture was not a typically Dutch 
phenomenon Thanks to the growth of universities male student cultures 
revolving around singing drinking and socialising outside the house 
proliferated throughout Europe In fifteenthcentury Florence young males 
also used clothingparticularly the materials of which it was madeas a 
mark of youthfulness and class Young women in turn were far less visible 
and audible especially the daughters of the elite In early modern Russia 
highranking young women wore veils outside their residences sat behind 
screens in church and moved around Moscow in closed carriages or sledges 
The idea was that they should avoid being seen by men who were not family 
members It was only from around 1660 that the seclusion of elite women in 
Russia began to be questioned partly thanks to the awareness that Western 
women were freer to move about
