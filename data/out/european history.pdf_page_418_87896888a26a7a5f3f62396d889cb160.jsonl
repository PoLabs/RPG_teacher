many other places in Germany the Reformation became firmly established as

Outside Germany the Reformation triggered the Catholic Pilgrimage of 
Grace in northern England in 1536 the Prayer Book Rebellion in the southwest 
of England in 1549 and Wyatts Rebellion in 1553 all three taking issue with 
the religious policies of Henry VIII 14911547 and his successor Queen 
Mary 15161558 In the Low Countries religious unrest erupted in the 1566 
Iconoclasm which subsequently evolved into a fullblown revolution against 
the rule of Charles Vs son and successor Philip II 15271598 and ultimately
