1571 Social CRM and support
Social customers are increasingly turning to social media channels for support With the 
immediate accessibility offered through mobile devices they see this as a convenient channel 
to communicate with brands This means that brands need to respond quickly and transparently 
to consumers questions gripes and even compliments A support query going unanswered 
on Twitter for instance is likely to cause frustration for the consumer and prompt them to 
take a situation that is already visible to other consumers even further potentially causing a 
brand crisis 
Figure 1514 Social CRM is valuable 
Brands should carefully consider whether all social media channels are appropriate for them 
and be prepared for any eventuality Brands that are well liked will generally have positive 
responses on social media and those that receive a mediocre response from consumers will 
have a bit of a mixed bag but those that have a lot of support issues are likely to experience 
very large numbers of complaints that need to be addressed
