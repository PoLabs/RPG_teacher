Introduction
Memories are narrativesrepresentations and retellings of eventswhich 
provide a shared sense of the past Through memory communities and not 
just individuals can remember events such as the emergence of modern states 
or the history of a town or religion Memory is often a collective and social act 
constituted in the present by the telling and retelling of stories about the past 
In the early modern period memory played an important role as a foundation 
for and a legitimator of laws privileges customs andon a larger scaleof 
political and religious systems Memory played an especially large role in the 
case of confessional history which sought to explain and affirm the beliefs 
and attitudes of various religions such as Roman Catholicism Lutheranism 
Calvinism and more While this understanding of memory implies a certain 
stability in practices and in forms of ones own religious identity the use of 
memory could also be applied as a justification for major changes in such 
systems by pointing to a perceived continuity with the past a proposed 
change could actually be portrayed as a restoration of stability or a return to 
a lost state Religious reform movementsnot just Protestant but also in the 
core of the Catholic Churchsaw the solution to contemporary crises in a 
return to the Golden Age of antiquity and the early Christians However the 
rise of humanism also brought with it a change in the way history was studied 
used and perceived Relative to medieval historiography history was now 
less oriented in a teleological way to transcendent topics and the history of 
salvation
There are differences between the early modern historiographies of Western 
Southern and Central Europe Thus this chapter presents examples which 
deal with the past from different areas of Europenamely England the Dutch 
Republic and the Lands of the Bohemian Crown They nevertheless display 
very well these basic tendencies related to memory and its use though with
