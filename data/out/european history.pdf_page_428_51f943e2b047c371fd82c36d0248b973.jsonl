408
In nineteenthcentury European societies a relatively large number of women 
primarily singles and widows were property owners or had businesses of 
their own even while their economic independence was limited by the legal 
system Across Europe millions of women became breadwinners by the 
second half of the century although frequently out of necessity rather than 
choice Besides the female workforce employed in various trades domestic 
service industry and agriculture a growing number of middleclass women 
appeared in whitecollar occupations clerks teachers journalists etc thanks 
to the improving standards of girls education and the new fields of study to 
which women had access by the 1860s and 1870s 
Womens universal exclusion from political rights was increasingly 
considered an anomaly in the light of their growing tax obligations 
qualifications and aptitude in their chosen professions The idea of female 
suffrage was discussed more and more frequently in the press and in 
pamphlets It was advocated by activist organisations the members of 
which were often called suffragists or suffragettes Womens demands for 
political representation received support from certain liberalminded male 
contemporaries such as John Stuart Mill 18061873 the political philosopher 
and member of the British Parliament who published The Subjection of Women 
in 1869
By the eve of the First World War universal suffrageincluding voting 
rights for all adult womenseemed like an increasingly realistic goal in most 
European countries The first to introduce unlimited female suffrage including 
the right to be elected was Finland in 1906 In most European states however 
women had to wait until the end of the First World War to gain active and 
passive voting rights 
Abolitionist Movements The Abolition of Serfdom
In Western Europe the disappearance of serfdom and manorialism was a 
gradual process which had already started in the late Middle Ages and ended 
no later than the eighteenth century In Central and Eastern Europe however 
serfdom continued to exist prevailing in the Habsburg Empire Prussia and 
Russia at least up until the early nineteenth century There the abolishment 
of serfdom occurred within relatively short periods during the nineteenth 
century and was regulated from above by laws and decrees
In Prussia serfdom was abolished in the whole kingdom in 1807 as part 
of a much broader set of reforms although the regulation of detailssuch 
as the services which peasants owed their landlords and the conditions on 
which they could become owners of their plotstook several more years In 
other German states the elimination of serfdom was decreed between 1804 
and 1808
