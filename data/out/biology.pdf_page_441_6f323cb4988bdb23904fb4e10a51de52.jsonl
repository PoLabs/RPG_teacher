the efficiency of transcription may be present several times in a promoter
RNAbased enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit and catalyzes the
formation of peptide bonds
extrachromosomal covalently closed circular DNA molecule that may only contain one or a few genes
common in prokaryotes
modification added to the 3 end of premRNAs to protect mRNA from degradation and assist mRNA
export from the nucleus
mRNA molecule simultaneously being translated by many ribosomes all going in the same direction
cluster of transcription factors and other proteins that recruit RNA polymerase II for
transcription of a DNA template
DNA sequence to which RNA polymerase and associated factors bind and initiate transcription
sequence of triplet codons in mRNA that specify a particular protein a ribosome shift of one or
two nucleotides in either direction completely abolishes synthesis of that protein
in prokaryotes termination of transcription by an interaction between RNA
polymerase and the rho protein at a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template
termination sequencedependent termination of prokaryotic mRNA synthesis caused by
hairpin formation in the mRNA that stalls the polymerase
direct alteration of one or more nucleotides in an mRNA that has already been synthesized
AGGAGG initiates prokaryotic translation by interacting with rRNA molecules
comprising the 30S ribosome
short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment
molecules synthesized by RNA polymerase III that have a variety of functions including
splicing premRNAs and regulating transcription factors
process of removing introns and reconnecting exons in a premRNA
AUG or rarely GUG on an mRNA from which translation begins always specifies methionine
conserved promoter sequence in eukaryotes and prokaryotes that helps to establish the initiation site
for transcription
strand of DNA that specifies the complementary mRNA molecule
region of locally unwound DNA that allows for transcription of mRNA
nucleotides preceding the initiation site in general sequences toward the 5 end relative to a site on
the mRNA
CHAPTER SUMMARY
151 The Genetic Code
The genetic code refers to the DNA alphabet A T C G the RNA alphabet A U C G and the polypeptide
alphabet 20 amino acids The central dogma describes the flow of genetic information in the cell from genes
to mRNA to proteins Genes are used to make mRNA by the process of transcription mRNA is used to
synthesize proteins by the process of translation The genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in
mRNA specify only 20 amino acids and three nonsense codons Most amino acids have several similar
codons Almost every species on the planet uses the same genetic code
