Napoleons Grande Arme fuelled fears of an international revolution among 
the elites of the postrevolutionary era Similar fears were triggered by the 
exiled revolutionaries of 1848 and 1871 and to an even greater extent by the 
Russian Italian French and Spanish anarchists whoafter a series of bomb 
attacks in the 1880stargeted European heads of state during the decade of 
regicides in the 1890s Each of these groups of political exiles were suspected 
to belong to international revolutionary networksand for good reason as 
many of these exiles aimed for this sort of international network For instance 
Giuseppe Mazzini founder of the nationalist movement Young Italy 
inspired the establishment in 1834 of the international association Young 
Europe Another example is the Central European Democratic Committee 
formed in London in 1850 to bring about revolutionary political change on a 
continental scale Also in London the International Workingmens Association 
was established in 1864 as the first of several consecutive Internationals 
which sought to unite all workers of the world Their ultimate failure to do 
so is characteristic of most of these international networks of exiled radicals 
Yet ironically their attempts did mobilise their opponents to create similar 
international networks with counterrevolutionary aims Notably the various 
national police forces developed an international network in their attempt to 
monitor and control the movement of people through systematic forms of 
registration and documentation like passports and visas 
Policing the mobility of Europeans was also a manifestation of the increased 
power of the state This increased power of the state was another important 
factor which induced a growing number of people to leave their homelands 
Western European religious and political dissidents were or at least were 
made to feel forced to leave their homelands for instance repression by the 
Dutch state following the Protestant Church Secession of 1834 compelled some 
7500 Dutch orthodox Protestants to leave for Iowa and Michigan Both after 
the revolution of 1848 and the Paris Commune of 1871 and also as a regular 
punishment several thousand French political opponents were deported to 
the colonies of New Caledonia and French Guyana the Jewish officer Alfred 
Dreyfus 18591935 among them Much larger numbers of refugees were 
fleeing war ethnic cleansing and genocide For instance between 1821 and 
1828 Greek nationalists forced some 200000 Turks to flee from Greece After 
the Crimean War of 18531856 the Russian Emperor Alexander II 18181881 
forced a similar number of Tatars to move mainly to Anatolia yet these 
numbers were dwarfed by the hundreds of thousands of Muslims expelled 
after the Russian pacification of the Caucasus 18591864 In the aftermath 
of the FrancoPrussian War 18701871 80000 Germans were expelled from 
France while 130000 French citizens felt forced to leave AlsaceLorraine From 
the end of the century through to the First World War the fragmentation of
