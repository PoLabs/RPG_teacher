Figure 3410 The esophagus transfers food from the mouth to the stomach through peristaltic movements
A ringlike muscle called a sphincter forms valves in the digestive system The gastroesophageal sphincter
is located at the stomach end of the esophagus In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the
bolus of food this sphincter opens and the bolus enters the stomach When there is no swallowing action this
sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the stomach from traveling up the esophagus Many animals
have a true sphincter however in humans there is no true sphincter but the esophagus remains closed when
there is no swallowing action Acid reflux or heartburn occurs when the acidic digestive juices escape into the
esophagus
Stomach
A large part of digestion occurs in the stomach shown in Figure 3411 The stomach is a saclike organ that
secretes gastric digestive juices The pH in the stomach is between 15 and 25 This highly acidic environment is
required for the chemical breakdown of food and the extraction of nutrients When empty the stomach is a rather
small organ however it can expand to up to 20 times its resting size when filled with food This characteristic is
particularly useful for animals that need to eat when food is available
