of glucose uptake in most body cells and by increasing glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscles and the liver
Together glucagon and insulin regulate blood glucose levels

Pineal Gland
The pineal gland produces melatonin The rate of melatonin production is affected by the photoperiod
Collaterals from the visual pathways innervate the pineal gland During the day photoperiod little melatonin
is produced however melatonin production increases during the dark photoperiod night In some mammals
melatonin has an inhibitory affect on reproductive functions by decreasing production and maturation of sperm
oocytes and reproductive organs Melatonin is an effective antioxidant protecting the CNS from free radicals
such as nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide Lastly melatonin is involved in biological rhythms particularly
circadian rhythms such as the sleepwake cycle and eating habits
Gonads
The gonadsthe male testes and female ovariesproduce steroid hormones The testes produce androgens
testosterone being the most prominent which allow for the development of secondary sex characteristics and
the production of sperm cells The ovaries produce estradiol and progesterone which cause secondary sex
characteristics and prepare the body for childbirth
Endocrine Glands and their Associated Hormones

Gland
Associated
Hormones
Effect
releasing and
inhibiting hormones
regulate hormone release from pituitary gland produce oxytocin
produce uterine contractions and milk secretion in females
Hypothalamus
antidiuretic hormone
ADH
water reabsorption from kidneys vasoconstriction to increase blood
pressure
growth hormone
GH
promotes growth of body tissues protein synthesis metabolic functions
prolactin PRL
promotes milk production
thyroid stimulating
hormone TSH
stimulates thyroid hormone release
adrenocorticotropic
hormone ACTH
stimulates hormone release by adrenal cortex glucocorticoids
Pituitary
