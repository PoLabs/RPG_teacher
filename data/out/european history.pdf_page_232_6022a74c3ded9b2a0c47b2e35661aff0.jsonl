of marriage as mutual support both financial and procreative Just a few 
years later in 1804 the French Civil Code which had been introduced in the 
Napoleonic backlash against the French Revolution marked a return to more 
conservative rules on marriage and the family after various revolutionaryera 
experiments that had included rights to civil marriage and divorce as well as 
womens rights within marriage 
These legal developments were a watershed in the relationship of the family 
and household more generally with the states in which they resided To be 
sure the family had previously been subject to some governmental regulations 
and was certainly subjected to church rules on a wide variety of matters from 
incest to marriage and its collapse Throughout much of European history 
marriage had been seen as a sacrament a sacred ritual within Christianity 
that bestowed divine grace As such various church edicts in the medieval 
and early modern period allowed people to marry as long as they chose to do 
so freely and as long as they married in front of witnesses who could testify 
to the new union The marriage contract was effectively between the couple 
and God not between the families of the marrying couple or as an act before 
the state The advent of new Protestant traditions in the early modern period 
meant that at least for Protestants marriage was no longer seen as a sacrament 
but it was still upheld as something special and worthy of protection 
New legislation that took off with the French Revolution was therefore a 
radical change as were the reforms instituted by various civil codes afterwards 
One of the most significant changes was the introduction of compulsory civil 
marriage which meant that individuals needed to marry through the stateat 
state registry offices or with judgesrather than through the church even if 
they chose to marry in the church afterwards In countries that adopted laws 
on civil marriage the only marriages that were valid were those registered 
with the state The civil marriage movement took off across much of Europe 
over the course of the long nineteenth century for example in France 1792 
Prussia 1794 and as an option in England in 1836 and its roots could also 
be seen in earlier attempts to separate matters of church and state such as

Alongside marriage divorce and marital separation shifted to the centre of 
debates about changing policies on the family in nineteenthcentury Europe 
Under Catholicism separation from bed and board was allowed in cases of 
marital breakdown but not divorce Protestants allowed divorce but rules 
varied widely with some more restrictive than others Against this backdrop 
different states gradually introduced laws on divorce and these varied for 
example with allowances only in case of spousal abuse abandonment or 
adultery Rules on divorce also varied within countries depending on how 
unified their legal systems were For example in Germany divorce was easier 
to obtain within predominantly Protestant Prussia than within predominantly
