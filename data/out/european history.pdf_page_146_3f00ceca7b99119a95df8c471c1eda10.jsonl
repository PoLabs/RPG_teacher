United States of America
When the American Army arrived in Europe in 1917 and played a decisive 
role in the outcome of the First World War in 1918 Europeans could see for 
themselves that the United States of America had become a world power 
Simultaneously American companies became vital participants in European 
economic life while European cultural life was beginning to be reshaped 
by American feature films as well as jazz music Another channel of this 
transatlantic influence was formed by a multitude of American tourists that 
visited Europe in the 1920s where they were received as rich people on a poor

US These critics were afraid of American gender relations too because the 
modern American woman was said to be hedonistic and powerful and this 
type of woman might have been dangerous for traditional family values
The antiAmericanism of the extreme right was rooted in chauvinistic 
nationalism and a phobia of the Americanisation of Europe and the wider 
world For example the National Socialists in Germany asserted that the US 
was founded and governed by Jewish and African American people who 
were racially inferior This approach contrasted American modernism and 
internationalism with national traditions and the homely atmosphere of the
