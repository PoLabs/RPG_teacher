of the secondary xylem have a large internal diameter and their primary cell walls are not extensively thickened
This is known as early wood or spring wood During the fall season the secondary xylem develops thickened
cell walls forming late wood or autumn wood which is denser than early wood This alternation of early and
late wood is due largely to a seasonal decrease in the number of vessel elements and a seasonal increase in
the number of tracheids It results in the formation of an annual ring which can be seen as a circular ring in the
cross section of the stem Figure 3012 An examination of the number of annual rings and their nature such
as their size and cell wall thickness can reveal the age of the tree and the prevailing climatic conditions during
each season
Figure 3012 The rate of wood growth increases in summer and decreases in winter producing a characteristic ring
for each year of growth Seasonal changes in weather patterns can also affect the growth ratenote how the rings
vary in thickness credit Adrian Pingstone
Stem Modifications
Some plant species have modified stems that are especially suited to a particular habitat and environment
Figure 3013 A rhizome is a modified stem that grows horizontally underground and has nodes and
internodes Vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants such as ginger and ferns
Corms are similar to rhizomes except they are more rounded and fleshy such as in gladiolus Corms contain
stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter Stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the
ground or just below the surface and can give rise to new plants at the nodes Runners are a type of stolon
that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals strawberries are an
example Tubers are modified stems that may store starch as seen in the potato Solanum sp Tubers arise
as swollen ends of stolons and contain many adventitious or unusual buds familiar to us as the eyes on
potatoes A bulb which functions as an underground storage unit is a modification of a stem that has the
appearance of enlarged fleshy leaves emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem as seen in
the iris
