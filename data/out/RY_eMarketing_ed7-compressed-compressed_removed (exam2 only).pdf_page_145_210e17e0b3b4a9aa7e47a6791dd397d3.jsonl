The beautiful thing about digital marketing is that you can track every single user interaction 
and use this information to learn from and continually improve your efforts You should track 
the success of your social media campaigns on an ongoing basis and set milestones for your 
team at less frequent intervals every couple of months or so when you will sit down and do

tools to suit your measurement and reporting requirements 
Platform insights

businesses and brands that sign up for business pages or profiles These are a useful starting 
point for reporting on your social media efforts from numbers of followers or fans to time of 
day when your audience is most active and interact with the content you share

links so that you can segment that traffic in your 
website reports

that you can add to links for example the links 
you share in your social posts They include 
information about the links placement and 
purpose making it easier to track clicks and

in such as search display or social have contributed to your campaign You will be able to 
see which channel sent the most number of users to your site what the conversion rate of the 
various channels are and which channel offers the best return on investment You can also
