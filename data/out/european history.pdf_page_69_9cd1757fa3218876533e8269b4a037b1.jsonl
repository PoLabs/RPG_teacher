seen as subverting efforts to construct nationally homogenous states and 
with the rise of nationalism some became targets of forced assimilation see 
for instance the Russification campaigns in the western parts of the Tsarist 
Empire or the Norwegianisation of Sami and Kven peoples 
With the spread of nationalism and the increasingly popular notion that state 
borders should correspond with ethnic boundaries the scene was also set for 
irredentism as a challenge to imperialism The old European empires contained 
territories and populations that had previously formed parts of other polities 
or that were claimed by newly formed states Essentially irredentism proposed 
an alternative redrawing of borders based on historical and ethnic precedents
Mental Maps
Maps could be easily drawn on paper and to a small intellectual elite national 
borders might have been evident and meaningful But the maps within peoples 
minds the basic cultural coordinates by which they lived changed much more 
slowly in this period usually due to state intervention disruption by war and 
extended literacy and print culture In Britain for instance the Napoleonic 
Wars and the consequent military mobilisation increased awareness among 
ordinary people of a grander scale of territory and identity though without 
erasing the imaginary boundaries associated with regional belonging By the

strong regionalisms also persisted after the unification of Italy In the famous 
words of Italian statesman Massimo dAzeglio 17981866 once Italy was

people in the Italian Peninsula lived Further east when asked about their 
origin and identity a nineteenthcentury peasant in the Carpathian Mountains 
or in the Balkans was likely to answer by reference to their village or declaring 
their religion both of which constituted the centre of gravity of their life A 
Polish mayor would most likely identify with his native region and only find 
out from newspapers that he was in fact Polish
A key element in the transformation of the continent during the nineteenth 
century was the industrial revolution which went handinhand with 
explosive population growth particularly in Western Europe and later in 
the rest of the continent The resulting overpopulation set in motion massive 
waves of emigration especially to America but also across Europe as whole 
State frontiers may have become increasingly fixed and stable but thanks to 
new infrastructure and new possibilities of travel Europeans also became
