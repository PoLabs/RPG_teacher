but also to its economic advantages Trade would flourish between Russias 
remote and isolated regions and its centre And more than that the railway 
was intended to bring civilisation to the backward populations of the 
Russian peripheries Planners and bureaucrats alike imagined the integration 
of empire as a process wherein ideas and normative orders travelled from 
the centres to the peripheries with goods and raw materials sent back to feed 
the economy and strengthen the state The railroad was thought to transport 
Russia and its multiethnic population into modernity
From modest beginnings the Russian rail network grew with impressive 
speed over the next decades At the end of the nineteenth century it connected 
not only the empires European regions but reached its Central Asian and Far 
Eastern peripheries The network was a representation of state powerits 
lines connecting the metropolis with its peripheriesbut it did not provide 
connections between regions The Russian railroad network was thus a means 
of imperial integration and international separation at the same time Although 
it was connected to Europe via rail the Russian Empire used a different gauge 
than its neighbours 
The construction of the TransSiberian Railway between 1891 and 1916 
was testament to Russias urge to integrate its peripheries on the tracks Even 
before its final completion the effects of the TransSiberian Railway connecting 
Moscow with Vladivostok at the shores of the Pacific were clearly discernible 
the railroad enabled the resettlement of peasants from the European parts of 
the empire to Siberia and the Far East It also served as an important means 
for Russian grain exports Towns and cities along the line were booming The 
TransSiberian was also strategically important located dangerously close to 
the Chinese borderduring the RussoJapanese War of 19041905 its limited 
capacities caused severe logistical problems for the Russian Army 
The expansion of the railroad network had several unintended consequences 
At first the lines and networks did not always follow longestablished trade 
routes Many towns and regions that were not connected to the railway 
system faced economic decline and lost their former political significance In 
other words where some peripheries grew closer to centres and became less 
peripheral new peripheries emerged at the same time Secondly whereas the 
railroad and its infrastructures were definitely modern its impact on societies 
at the periphery were not always modernising in the sense tsarist elites had 
hoped for In many cases peasants and local elites opposed the construction of 
new lines or applied their own agency and practices when using them 
Thirdly the railway contributed not only to the expansion of the centres 
power over peripheries but it also induced change and dynamism in the 
imperial centres themselves Around 1900 many observers from the Russian 
urban elite regarded train stations in major Russian cities as places of disorder
