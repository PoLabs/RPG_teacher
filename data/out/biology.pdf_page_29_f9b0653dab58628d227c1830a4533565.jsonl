review papers require an outline
The introduction starts with brief but broad background information about what is known in the field A good
introduction also gives the rationale of the work It justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end
of the paper where the researcher will present the hypothesis or research question driving the research The
introduction refers to the published scientific work of others and therefore requires citations following the style of
the journal Using the work or ideas of others without proper citation is plagiarism
The materials and methods section includes a complete and accurate description of the substances the
researchers use and the method and techniques they use to gather data The description should be thorough
enough to allow another researcher to repeat the experiment and obtain similar results but it does not have to be
verbose This section will also include information on how the researchers made measurements and the types of
calculations and statistical analyses they used to examine raw data Although the materials and methods section
gives an accurate description of the experiments it does not discuss them
Some journals require a results section followed by a discussion section but it is more common to combine both
If the journal does not allow combining both sections the results section simply narrates the findings without any
further interpretation The researchers present results with tables or graphs but they do not present duplicate
information In the discussion section the researchers will interpret the results describe how variables may be
related and attempt to explain the observations It is indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to
put the results in the context of previously published scientific research Therefore researchers include proper
citations in this section as well
Finally the conclusion section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings While the scientific
paper almost certainly answers one or more scientific questions that the researchers stated any good research
should lead to more questions Therefore a welldone scientific paper allows the researchers and others to
continue and expand on the findings
Review articles do not follow the IMRAD format because they do not present original scientific findings or
primary literature Instead they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature
and typically include extensive reference sections
12  Themes and Concepts of Biology
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify and describe the properties of life

Describe the levels of organization among living things

Recognize and interpret a phylogenetic tree

List examples of different subdisciplines in biology
Biology is the science that studies life but what exactly is life This may sound like a silly question with an
obvious response but it is not always easy to define life For example a branch of biology called virology
studies viruses which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others Although viruses can
attack living organisms cause diseases and even reproduce they do not meet the criteria that biologists use
to define life Consequently virologists are not biologists strictly speaking Similarly some biologists study the
early molecular evolution that gave rise to life Since the events that preceded life are not biological events these
scientists are also excluded from biology in the strict sense of the term
From its earliest beginnings biology has wrestled with three questions What are the shared properties that
make something alive Once we know something is alive how do we find meaningful levels of organization in
its structure Finally when faced with the remarkable diversity of life how do we organize the different kinds of
organisms so that we can better understand them As scientists discover new organisms every day biologists
continue to seek answers to these and other questions
Properties of Life
All living organisms share several key characteristics or functions order sensitivity or response to the
environment reproduction adaptation growth and development regulation homeostasis energy processing
and evolution When viewed together these nine characteristics serve to define life
