33 REVOLUTIONS AND CIVIL WARS
347
century Following an abortive rebellion in 1867 the movement turned away 
from attempting mass revolution shifting instead to agrarian agitation and 
from the 1880s a bombing campaign organised from the United States The 
United Kingdom continued to grapple with the Irish Question attempting 
but failing to enact measures of devolution in 1886 and 1893 to satisfy 
Irish demands for selfgovernment in 1886 and 1893 By the first decade of 
the twentieth century these demands had reached boiling point The British 
Constitution appeared capable of containing them but its limits were revealed 
in the Irish revolutionary period of 19121923
The Paris Commune was mythicised by leftwing forces across the continent 
but also undermined the cohesion of the First International which suffered 
from repression and reduced public support It also endured internal conflicts 
like the one between Marxist statists and Bakunian antiauthoritarians After 
the Firsts dissolution in 1876 a Second International would be founded in 
1889 without the participation of anarchosyndicalists
Disagreements between revolutionary and reformer socialists continued to 
prevent the unification of the workingclass political movement and ultimately 
the opposers of the liberal state and the capitalist system failed to revolutionise 
Europe Britain was the most industrialised country in Europe and according 
to Marxism the natural location for the revolution of the proletariat But union 
leaders opted for reformist policies within the constitutional system based on 
Chartist demands that formed the basis of political reforms in 1867 1884 and 
1918 In Germany social democracy was hugely successful among workers 
Bismarck established antisocialist laws in the 18701880s after two failed 
attempts to assassinate the emperor but he also preventively introduced social 
rights and benefits for workers In France reformist Possibilists held a central 
position within the socialist movement
It was rather in Southern Europe where revolutionaries who rejected 
electoral participation in the liberal states institutions were more active in 
their attempts to bring about immediate revolution In Spain where in 1873 
the Cantonalists endeavoured to create a federal republic and Italy a robust 
clandestine anarchist movement developed against the background of less 
industrialised societies and state persecution as in the infamous Mano Negra 
affair in 188283 In the vein of some Russian exiles including Bakunin 
influential Spanish and Italian activists rejected the Marxist fixation on the 
revolutionary role of the industrial proletariat and attempted to exploit rural 
unrest to urge widespread insurrectional efforts Eventually some anarchists 
translated the propaganda of the deed into terrorist acts with spectacular 
attacks like the assassinations of the French President 1894 the Spanish 
head of government 1897 or the Italian King Umberto I 1900 Another 
assassination that of the heir to the throne of AustriaHungary Archduke
