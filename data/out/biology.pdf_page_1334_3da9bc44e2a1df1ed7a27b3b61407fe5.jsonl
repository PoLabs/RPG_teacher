BCRs on nave B cells are of the IgM class and occasionally IgD class IgM molecules make up approximately
ten percent of all antibodies Prior to antibody secretion plasma cells assemble IgM molecules into pentamers
five individual antibodies linked by a joining J chain as shown in Figure 4223 The pentamer arrangement
means that these macromolecules can bind ten identical antigens However IgM molecules released early in
the adaptive immune response do not bind to antigens as stably as IgGs which are one of the possible types
of antibodies secreted in large quantities upon reexposure to the same pathogen Figure 4223 summarizes the
properties of immunoglobulins and illustrates their basic structures
Figure 4223 Immunoglobulins have different functions but all are composed of light and heavy chains that form a
Yshaped structure
IgAs populate the saliva tears breast milk and mucus secretions of the gastrointestinal respiratory and
genitourinary tracts Collectively these bodily fluids coat and protect the extensive mucosa 4000 square feet
in humans The total number of IgA molecules in these bodily secretions is greater than the number of IgG
molecules in the blood serum A small amount of IgA is also secreted into the serum in monomeric form
Conversely some IgM is secreted into bodily fluids of the mucosa Similar to IgM IgA molecules are secreted
as polymeric structures linked with a J chain However IgAs are secreted mostly as dimeric molecules not
pentamers
IgE is present in the serum in small quantities and is best characterized in its role as an allergy mediator IgD is
also present in small quantities Similar to IgM BCRs of the IgD class are found on the surface of nave B cells
This class supports antigen recognition and maturation of B cells to plasma cells
Antibody Functions
Differentiated plasma cells are crucial players in the humoral response and the antibodies they secrete
are particularly significant against extracellular pathogens and toxins Antibodies circulate freely and act
independently of plasma cells Antibodies can be transferred from one individual to another to temporarily protect
against infectious disease For instance a person who has recently produced a successful immune response
against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity
through antibodies in the donors blood serum This phenomenon is called passive immunity it also occurs
naturally during breastfeeding which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to infections during the first few
months of life
Antibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them as illustrated in Figure 4224 by blocking key
sites on the pathogen that enhance their infectivity such as receptors that dock pathogens on host cells
Antibody neutralization can prevent pathogens from entering and infecting host cells as opposed to the CTL
mediated approach of killing cells that are already infected to prevent progression of an established infection
The neutralized antibodycoated pathogens can then be filtered by the spleen and eliminated in urine or feces
