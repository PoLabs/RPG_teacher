KEY TERMS
individual with an error in chromosome number includes chromosome segment deletions and
duplications
any of the nonsex chromosomes
also map unit relative distance that corresponds to a 001 recombination frequency
theory proposing that chromosomes are the genes vehicles and that
their behavior during meiosis is the physical basis of the inheritance patterns that Mendel observed
detachment 180 rotation and chromosome arm reinsertion
individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species
process by which homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical
exchanges at their arms also crossing over
a karyotypes photographic image
an individuals chromosome number and appearance includes the size banding patterns and
centromere position
otherwise diploid genotype in which one chromosome is missing
failure of synapsed homologs to completely separate and migrate to separate poles during the
meiosis first cell division
progeny resulting from homologous recombination that exhibits a different
allele combination compared with its parents
inversion that occurs outside the centromere
progeny that exhibits the same allelic combination as its parents
inversion that involves the centromere
individual with an incorrect number of chromosome sets
average number of crossovers between two alleles observed as the number of
nonparental types in a progenys population
process by which one chromosome segment dissociates and reattaches to a different
nonhomologous chromosome
otherwise diploid genotype in which one entire chromosome duplicates
condensing X chromosomes into Barr bodies during embryonic development in females to
compensate for the double genetic dose
CHAPTER SUMMARY
131 Chromosomal Theory and Genetic Linkage
Sutton and Boveris Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance states that chromosomes are the vehicles of genetic
heredity Neither Mendelian genetics nor gene linkage is perfectly accurate Instead chromosome behavior
involves segregation independent assortment and occasionally linkage Sturtevant devised a method to
assess recombination frequency and infer linked genes relative positions and distances on a chromosome on
the basis of the average number of crossovers in the intervening region between the genes Sturtevant
correctly presumed that genes are arranged in serial order on chromosomes and that recombination between
homologs can occur anywhere on a chromosome with equal likelihood Whereas linkage causes alleles on the
