echinoderms and chordates are all eucoelomates A third group of triploblasts has a slightly different coelom
lined partly by mesoderm and partly by endoderm Although still functionally a coelom these are considered
false coeloms and so we call these animals pseudocoelomates The phylum Nematoda roundworms is an
example of a pseudocoelomate True coelomates can be further characterized based on other features of their
early embryological development
Figure 2710 Body cavities Triploblasts may be a acoelomates b eucoelomates or c pseudocoelomates
Acoelomates have no body cavity Eucoelomates have a body cavity within the mesoderm called a coelom in which
both the gut and the body wall are lined with mesoderm Pseudocoelomates also have a body cavity but only the body
wall is lined with mesoderm credit a modification of work by Jan Derk credit b modification of work by NOAA credit

Embryonic Development of the Mouth
Bilaterally symmetrical tribloblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in
the origin of the mouth When the primitive gut forms the opening that first connects the gut cavity to the outside
of the embryo is called the blastopore Most animals have openings at both ends of the gut mouth at one end
and anus at the other One of these openings will develop at or near the site of the blastopore In Protostomes
mouth first the mouth develops at the blastopore Figure 2711 In Deuterostomes mouth second the
mouth develops at the other end of the gut Figure 2711 and the anus develops at the site of the blastopore
Protostomes include arthropods mollusks and annelids Deuterostomes include more complex animals such as
chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms Recent evidence has challenged this simple
view of the relationship between the location of the blastopore and the formation of the mouth however and
the theory remains under debate Nevertheless these details of mouth and anus formation reflect general
differences in the organization of protostome and deuterostome embryos which are also expressed in other
developmental features
One of these differences between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation beginning
from the gastrula stage Since body cavity formation tends to accompany the formation of the mesoderm the
mesoderm of protostomes and deuterostomes forms differently The coelom of most protostomes is formed
through a process called schizocoely The mesoderm in these organisms is usually the product of specific
blastomeres which migrate into the interior of the embryo and form two clumps of mesodermal tissue Within
each clump cavities develop and merge to form the hollow opening of the coelom Deuterostomes differ in that
their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely Here the mesoderm develops as pouches that are
pinched off from the endoderm tissue These pouches eventually fuse and expand to fill the space between the
gut and the body wall giving rise to the coelom
Another difference in organization of protostome and deuterostome embryos is expressed during cleavage
Protostomes undergo spiral cleavage meaning that the cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated and thus
misaligned with respect to the cells of the opposite pole This is due to the oblique angle of cleavage relative
