Figure 1220 In mice the mottled agouti coat color A is dominant to a solid coloration such as black or gray A gene
at a separate locus C is responsible for pigment production The recessive c allele does not produce pigment and a
mouse with the homozygous recessive cc genotype is albino regardless of the allele present at the A locus Thus the
C gene is epistatic to the A gene
Epistasis can also occur when a dominant allele masks expression at a separate gene Fruit color in summer
squash is expressed in this way Homozygous recessive expression of the W gene ww coupled with
homozygous dominant or heterozygous expression of the Y gene YY or Yy generates yellow fruit and the
wwyy genotype produces green fruit However if a dominant copy of the W gene is present in the homozygous
or heterozygous form the summer squash will produce white fruit regardless of the Y alleles A cross between
white heterozygotes for both genes WwYy  WwYy would produce offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 12
white3 yellow1 green
Finally epistasis can be reciprocal such that either gene when present in the dominant or recessive form
expresses the same phenotype In the shepherds purse plant Capsella bursapastoris the characteristic of
seed shape is controlled by two genes in a dominant epistatic relationship When the genes A and B are both
homozygous recessive aabb the seeds are ovoid If the dominant allele for either of these genes is present
the result is triangular seeds That is every possible genotype other than aabb results in triangular seeds and a
cross between heterozygotes for both genes AaBb x AaBb would yield offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 15
triangular1 ovoid
As you work through genetics problems keep in mind that any single characteristic that results in a phenotypic
ratio that totals 16 is typical of a twogene interaction Recall the phenotypic inheritance pattern for Mendels
dihybrid cross which considered two noninteracting genes9331 Similarly we would expect interacting gene
pairs to also exhibit ratios expressed as 16 parts Note that we are assuming the interacting genes are not linked
they are still assorting independently into gametes
