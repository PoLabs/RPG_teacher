United States characteristic of the second half of the century and particularly 
the turn of the century can be interpreted as a spontaneous social response 
they left Europe in hopes of a better livelihood However in addition to growing 
inequality population growth also played a significant role in the process the 
reason for emigration at that time was clearly economic Between 1880 and 
the 1920s nearly twentyfive million Europeans migrated to the United States 
The reason behind this flood of migration was also the fact that the long trip 
became cheaper and more accessible because of the expansion of railroads 
in Europe and the steampowered oceangoing ships between the continents 
The peak of this trend was in 1907 when 13 million legal immigrants were 
registered in the United States Although a significant proportion of immigrants 
estimated to be about one third lived in the United States only temporarily to 
earn money and raise capital population movements were intense
The most important form of geographical mobility in the century however 
was urban migration from the countryside by those in search of a better life 
European urbanisation gained momentum in the nineteenth century and the 
urban population increased sixfold although most of the European population 
still did not live in cities before the First World War The social consequences 
of growing inequality became particularly visible in cities due to population 
concentration and also because the people who moved to cities mostly lost 
their traditional supportive social network A possible consequence of this lack 
of social support was urban pauperisation with recurrent epidemics poor 
housing and health conditions All of this became an increasingly problematic 
issue for city governments during the century Accordingly everything that 
these governments did to address urban pauperisation can also be interpreted 
as a response to the increasing sharpening inequal distribution of wealth and 
income from the regulation of housing conditions or construction of social 
housing to the development of urban social policy The latter mostly took the 
form of housing subsidies and aid to the urban poor
Another type of social reaction to inequality was the increase in social self
organisation The century was particularly marked by the selforganisation 
of industrial labour greatly affected by urban pauperisation The primary 
purpose of labour associations was initially to provide mutual assistance 
to members eg in the event of unemployment or job searches which 
was accompanied by the articulation of common interests as employees In 
addition to criticising working conditions eg working hours the danger 
of accidents an unhealthy workplace most workers initiatives were aimed 
at raising wages and questioning the distribution of income The standard of 
living of wage labour was particularly vulnerable to business cycles and rising 
prices and rents could have immediate negative consequences The number 
of strikes also increased during such pricesensitive periods as at the turn of 
the century The selforganisation of labour increased workers ability to assert
