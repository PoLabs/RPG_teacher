How Viruses Recognize a Host
Unlike living cells many viruses do not have a plasma membrane or any of the structures necessary to
sustain metabolic life Some viruses are simply composed of an inert protein shell enclosing DNA or RNA
To reproduce viruses must invade a living cell which serves as a host and then take over the hosts cellular
apparatus But how does a virus recognize its host
Viruses often bind to cellsurface receptors on the host cell For example the virus that causes human
influenza flu binds specifically to receptors on membranes of cells of the respiratory system Chemical
differences in the cellsurface receptors among hosts mean that a virus that infects a specific species for
example humans often cannot infect another species for example chickens
However viruses have very small amounts of DNA or RNA compared to humans and as a result viral
reproduction can occur rapidly Viral reproduction invariably produces errors that can lead to changes in
newly produced viruses these changes mean that the viral proteins that interact with cellsurface receptors
may evolve in such a way that they can bind to receptors in a new host Such changes happen randomly
and quite often in the reproductive cycle of a virus but the changes only matter if a virus with new binding
properties comes into contact with a suitable host In the case of influenza this situation can occur in
settings where animals and people are in close contact such as poultry and swine farms

Once a virus
jumps the former species barrier to a new host it can spread quickly Scientists watch newly appearing
viruses called emerging viruses closely in the hope that such monitoring can reduce the likelihood of global
viral epidemics
Cellsurface receptors are involved in most of the signaling in multicellular organisms There are three general
categories of cellsurface receptors ion channellinked receptors Gproteinlinked receptors and enzymelinked
receptors
Ion channellinked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific
ions to pass through To form a channel this type of cellsurface receptor has an extensive membranespanning
region In order to interact with the double layer of phospholipid fatty acid tails that form the center of the plasma
membrane many of the amino acids in the membranespanning region are hydrophobic in nature Conversely
the amino acids that line the inside of the channel are hydrophilic to allow for the passage of water or ions
When a ligand binds to the extracellular region of the channel there is a conformational change in the proteins
structure that allows ions such as sodium calcium magnesium and hydrogen to pass through Figure 95
Figure 95 Gated ion channels form a pore through the plasma membrane that opens when the signaling molecule
binds The open pore then allows ions to flow into or out of the cell
Gproteinlinked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a Gprotein The activated G
protein then interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane Figure 96 All Gproteinlinked
receptors have seven transmembrane domains but each receptor has its own specific extracellular domain and
Gproteinbinding site
