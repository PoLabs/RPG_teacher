had begun to have ideas and plans of his own When midday came he got ready
for another journey down into the Mountain He did not like it of course but it
was not so bad now he knew more or less what was in front of him Had he
known more about dragons and their wily ways he might have been more
frightened and less hopeful of catching this one napping
The sun was shining when he started but it was as dark as night in the tunnel
The light from the door almost closed soon faded as he went down So silent
was his going that smoke on a gentle wind could hardly have surpassed it and he
was inclined to feel a bit proud of himself as he drew near the lower door There
was only the very faintest glow to be seen
Old Smaug is weary and asleep he thought He cant see me and he wont
hear me Cheer up Bilbo He had forgotten or had never heard about dragons
sense of smell It is also an awkward fact that they can keep half an eye open
watching while they sleep if they are suspicious
Smaug certainly looked fast asleep almost dead and dark with scarcely a
snore more than a whiff of unseen steam when Bilbo peeped once more from
the entrance He was just about to step out on to the floor when he caught a
sudden thin and piercing ray of red from under the drooping lid of Smaugs left
eye He was only pretending to sleep He was watching the tunnel entrance
Hurriedly Bilbo stepped back and blessed the luck of his ring Then Smaug
spoke
Well thief I smell you and I feel your air I hear your breath Come along
Help yourself again there is plenty and to spare
But Bilbo was not quite so unlearned in dragonlore as all that and if Smaug
hoped to get him to come nearer so easily he was disappointed No thank you
O Smaug the Tremendous he replied I did not come for presents I only
wished to have a look at you and see if you were truly as great as tales say I did
not believe them
Do you now said the dragon somewhat flattered even though he did not
believe a word of it
Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the reality O Smaug the Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities replied Bilbo
You have nice manners for a thief and a liar said the dragon You seem
familiar with my name but I dont seem to remember smelling you before Who
are you and where do you come from may I ask
