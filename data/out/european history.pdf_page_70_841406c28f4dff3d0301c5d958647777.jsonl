increasingly mobile and able to escape the gravitational force of tightly 
demarcated states
Such population movements were powered by peoples mental maps in 
which the centre of imagination often lay beyond native borders in the nearest 
city the capital or remote destinations such as the Americas The hopes and 
expectations that led people to follow the path of emigration could be seen as 
a consequence of the changing frontier between what the historian Fernand 
Braudel called the possible and the impossible Thus lower transportation 
costs made it economically possible for many people to cover distances that 
had previously been insurmountable The same changes that made American 
grain competitive on European markets during the nineteenth century also 
made the emigration business flourish in the other direction For many people 
in the Hungarian half of the Habsburg Empire for instance the gravitational 
centre was the West variously conceived Prominent focal points included 
the imperial capital of Vienna Britain during the postNapoleonic Era and 
Paris at the time of the great revolutionary upheavals between 1789 and 1848 
and at the end of the century as the city of grandeur and culture not to 
mention the German universities which in a long tradition were destinations 
for study abroad among families of the Hungarian elite
Another consequence of the industrial revolution was the increased 
economic and commercial interconnectedness of the continent The first 
attempts at economic unification in Europe can be traced back to Napoleons 
Continental System which targeted Great Britain at the beginning of the 
nineteenth century Even after the fall of the French Emperor the idea of 
European economic unity was not completely abandoned Since industrial 
and agricultural goods often had to be transported over long distances the 
economic and custom borders between European states started to be seen 
as a hindrance to economic growth New unions and confederations were 
created for instance the German Customs Union in 1834 to ease economic 
and commercial exchanges within Europe contesting the previous economic 
boundaries between European states
Besides overpopulation cataclysmic events such as the Irish Famine 1845
1852 also acted as motors of emigration The famine was caused by a failure 
of diseased potato crops leading to the deaths of around a million people 
and compelling well over a million more to take a harrowing journey across 
the oceandriven by sheer desperation rather than dreams of wonderland 
In many cases these were people who had never left their villages before 
and who were now forced into making a transatlantic voyage in the worst 
of conditions They were likely to face generational poverty and fall prey to 
illness exploitation discrimination and deceit Across the European continent 
German colonists who sought a better life in the east had a saying that
