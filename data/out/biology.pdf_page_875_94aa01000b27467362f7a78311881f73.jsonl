a dry environment Frogs demonstrate a great diversity of parental behaviors with some species laying many
eggs and exhibiting little parental care to species that carry eggs and tadpoles on their hind legs or embedded
in their backs The males of Darwins frog carry tadpoles in their vocal sac Many tree frogs lay their eggs off the
ground in a folded leaf located over water so that the tadpoles can drop into the water as they hatch
The life cycle of most frogs as other amphibians consists of two distinct stages the larval stage followed by
metamorphosis to an adult stage However the eggs of frogs in the genus Eleutherodactylus develop directly
into little froglets guarded by a parent The larval stage of a frog the tadpole is often a filterfeeding herbivore
Tadpoles usually have gills a lateral line system longfinned tails and lack limbs At the end of the tadpole stage
frogs undergo metamorphosis into the adult form Figure 2920 During this stage the gills tail and lateral line
system disappear and four limbs develop The jaws become larger and are suited for carnivorous feeding and
the digestive system transforms into the typical short gut of a predator An eardrum and airbreathing lungs also
develop These changes during metamorphosis allow the larvae to move onto land in the adult stage

develop limbs but its tadpole tail is still evident
Apoda Caecilians
An estimated 185 species comprise the caecilians a group of amphibians that belong to the order Apoda They
have no limbs although they evolved from a legged vertebrate ancestor The complete lack of limbs makes
them resemble earthworms This resemblance is enhanced by folds of skin that look like the segments of an
earthworm However unlike earthworms they have teeth in both jaws and feed on a variety of small organisms
found in soil including earthworms Caecilians are adapted for a burrowing or aquatic lifestyle and they are
nearly blind with their tiny eyes sometimes covered by skin Although they have a single lung they also depend
on cutaneous respiration These animals are found in the tropics of South America Africa and Southern Asia In
the caecelians the only amphibians in which the males have copulatory structures fertilization is internal Some
caecilians are oviparous but most bear live young In these cases the females help nourish their young with
tissue from their oviduct before birth and from their skin after birth
