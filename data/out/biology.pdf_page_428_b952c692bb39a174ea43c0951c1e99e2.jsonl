Figure 1510 A generalized promoter of a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II is shown Transcription factors
recognize the promoter RNA polymerase II then binds and forms the transcription initiation complex A scientist
splices a eukaryotic promoter in front of a bacterial gene and inserts the gene in a bacterial chromosome Would
you expect the bacteria to transcribe the gene
Some eukaryotic promoters also have a conserved CAAT box GGCCAATCT at approximately 80 Further
upstream of the TATA box eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GCrich boxes GGCG or
octamer boxes ATTTGCAT These elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription
initiation and are often identified in more active genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell
Basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that
subsequently recruits RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation The complexity of eukaryotic transcription
does not end with the polymerases and promoters An army of other transcription factors which bind to upstream
enhancers and silencers also help to regulate the frequency with which premRNA is synthesized from a gene
Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed
Promoter Structures for RNA Polymerases I and III
The processes of bringing RNA polymerases I and III to the DNA template involve slightly less complex
collections of transcription factors but the general theme is the same
The conserved promoter elements for genes transcribed by polymerases I and III differ from those transcribed
by RNA polymerase II RNA polymerase I transcribes genes that have two GCrich promoter sequences in the
45 to 20 region These sequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur but promoters with
additional sequences in the region from 180 to 105 upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation
Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III have upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the
genes themselves
Eukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated process that requires a variety of proteins to interact with each
other and with the DNA strand Although the process of transcription in eukaryotes involves a greater metabolic
investment than in prokaryotes it ensures that the cell transcribes precisely the premRNAs that it needs for
protein synthesis
