Pollination by Deception
Orchids are highly valued flowers with many rare varieties Figure 3217 They grow in a range of specific
habitats mainly in the tropics of Asia South America and Central America At least 25000 species of
orchids have been identified
Figure 3217 Certain orchids use food deception or sexual deception to attract pollinators Shown here is a bee

Flowers often attract pollinators with food rewards in the form of nectar However some species of orchid
are an exception to this standard they have evolved different ways to attract the desired pollinators
They use a method known as food deception in which bright colors and perfumes are offered but no
food Anacamptis morio commonly known as the greenwinged orchid bears bright purple flowers and
emits a strong scent The bumblebee its main pollinator is attracted to the flower because of the strong
scentwhich usually indicates food for a beeand in the process picks up the pollen to be transported to
another flower
Other orchids use sexual deception Chiloglottis trapeziformis emits a compound that smells the same as
the pheromone emitted by a female wasp to attract male wasps The male wasp is attracted to the scent
lands on the orchid flower and in the process transfers pollen Some orchids like the Australian hammer
orchid use scent as well as visual trickery in yet another sexual deception strategy to attract wasps The
flower of this orchid mimics the appearance of a female wasp and emits a pheromone The male wasp tries
to mate with what appears to be a female wasp and in the process picks up pollen which it then transfers
to the next counterfeit mate
Double Fertilization
After pollen is deposited on the stigma it must germinate and grow through the style to reach the ovule The
microspores or the pollen contain two cells the pollen tube cell and the generative cell The pollen tube cell
grows into a pollen tube through which the generative cell travels The germination of the pollen tube requires
water oxygen and certain chemical signals As it travels through the style to reach the embryo sac the pollen
tubes growth is supported by the tissues of the style In the meantime if the generative cell has not already split
into two cells it now divides to form two sperm cells The pollen tube is guided by the chemicals secreted by
the synergids present in the embryo sac and it enters the ovule sac through the micropyle Of the two sperm
cells one sperm fertilizes the egg cell forming a diploid zygote the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei
forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm Together these two fertilization events in angiosperms
