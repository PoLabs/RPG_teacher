terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi The roots of the plant connect with the underground
parts of the fungus which form mycorrhizae Through mycorrhizae the fungus and plant exchange nutrients
and water greatly aiding the survival of both species Alternatively lichens are an association between a fungus
and its photosynthetic partner usually an alga
Fungi also cause serious infections in plants and animals For example Dutch elm disease which is caused by
the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi is a particularly devastating type of fungal infestation that destroys many native
species of elm Ulmus sp by infecting the trees vascular system The elm bark beetle acts as a vector
transmitting the disease from tree to tree Accidentally introduced in the 1900s the fungus decimated elm trees
across the continent Many European and Asiatic elms are less susceptible to Dutch elm disease than American
elms
In humans fungal infections are generally considered challenging to treat Unlike bacteria fungi do not respond
to traditional antibiotic therapy since they are eukaryotes Fungal infections may prove deadly for individuals
with compromised immune systems
Fungi have many commercial applications The food industry uses yeasts in baking brewing and cheese and
wine making Many industrial compounds are byproducts of fungal fermentation Fungi are the source of many
commercial enzymes and antibiotics
241  Characteristics of Fungi
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

List the characteristics of fungi

Describe the composition of the mycelium

Describe the mode of nutrition of fungi

Explain sexual and asexual reproduction in fungi
Although humans have used yeasts and mushrooms since prehistoric times until recently the biology of fungi
was poorly understood In fact up until the mid20th century many scientists classified fungi as plants Fungi
like plants are mostly sessile and seemingly rooted in place They possess a stemlike structure similar to
plants as well as having a rootlike fungal mycelium in the soil In addition their mode of nutrition was poorly
understood Progress in the field of fungal biology was the result of mycology the scientific study of fungi
Based on fossil evidence fungi appeared in the preCambrian era about 450 million years ago Molecular
biology analysis of the fungal genome demonstrates that fungi are more closely related to animals than plants
Under some current systematic phylogenies they continue to be a polyphyletic group of organisms that share
characteristics rather than sharing a single common ancestor
