CHAPTER SUMMARY
391 Systems of Gas Exchange
Animal respiratory systems are designed to facilitate gas exchange In mammals air is warmed and humidified
in the nasal cavity Air then travels down the pharynx through the trachea and into the lungs In the lungs air
passes through the branching bronchi reaching the respiratory bronchioles which house the first site of gas
exchange The respiratory bronchioles open into the alveolar ducts alveolar sacs and alveoli Because there
are so many alveoli and alveolar sacs in the lung the surface area for gas exchange is very large Several
protective mechanisms are in place to prevent damage or infection These include the hair and mucus in the
nasal cavity that trap dust dirt and other particulate matter before they can enter the system In the lungs
particles are trapped in a mucus layer and transported via cilia up to the esophageal opening at the top of the
trachea to be swallowed
392 Gas Exchange across Respiratory Surfaces
The lungs can hold a large volume of air but they are not usually filled to maximal capacity Lung volume
measurements include tidal volume expiratory reserve volume inspiratory reserve volume and residual
volume The sum of these equals the total lung capacity Gas movement into or out of the lungs is dependent
on the pressure of the gas Air is a mixture of gases therefore the partial pressure of each gas can be
calculated to determine how the gas will flow in the lung The difference between the partial pressure of the gas
in the air drives oxygen into the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body
393 Breathing
The structure of the lungs and thoracic cavity control the mechanics of breathing Upon inspiration the
diaphragm contracts and lowers The intercostal muscles contract and expand the chest wall outward The
intrapleural pressure drops the lungs expand and air is drawn into the airways When exhaling the intercostal
muscles and diaphragm relax returning the intrapleural pressure back to the resting state The lungs recoil and
airways close The air passively exits the lung There is high surface tension at the airairway interface in the
lung Surfactant a mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins acts like a detergent in the airways to reduce
surface tension and allow for opening of the alveoli
Breathing and gas exchange are both altered by changes in the compliance and resistance of the lung If the
compliance of the lung decreases as occurs in restrictive diseases like fibrosis the airways stiffen and collapse
upon exhalation Air becomes trapped in the lungs making breathing more difficult If resistance increases as
