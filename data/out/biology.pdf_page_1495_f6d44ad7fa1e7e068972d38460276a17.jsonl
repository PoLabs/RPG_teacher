trophic level
trophic level transfer efficiency TLTE
area of the Earth where water movement and storage occurs
portion of a natural ecosystem to be used for experiments
recreation of natural ecosystems entirely in a laboratory environment to be used for experiments
energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level
energy that remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organisms
respiration and heat loss
measure of the ability of a trophic level to convert the energy it receives from
the previous trophic level into biomass
resource such as fossil fuel that is either regenerated very slowly or not at all
trophic level that obtains its energy from the primary producers of an ecosystem
trophic level that obtains its energy from sunlight inorganic chemicals or dead andor
decaying organic material
measure of the average time an individual water molecule stays in a particular reservoir
speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed
ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances
usually a carnivore that eats primary consumers
ecosystem model that is created with computer programs to holistically model ecosystems
and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics
movement of one tectonic plate beneath another
carnivore that eats other carnivores
position of a species or group of species in a food chain or a food web
energy transfer efficiency between two successive trophic levels
CHAPTER SUMMARY
461 Ecology of Ecosystems
Ecosystems exist on land at sea in the air and underground Different ways of modeling ecosystems are
necessary to understand how environmental disturbances will affect ecosystem structure and dynamics
Conceptual models are useful to show the general relationships between organisms and the flow of materials
or energy between them Analytical models are used to describe linear food chains and simulation models
work best with holistic food webs
462 Energy Flow through Ecosystems
Organisms in an ecosystem acquire energy in a variety of ways which is transferred between trophic levels as
the energy flows from the bottom to the top of the food web with energy being lost at each transfer The
efficiency of these transfers is important for understanding the different behaviors and eating habits of warm
blooded versus coldblooded animals Modeling of ecosystem energy is best done with ecological pyramids of
energy although other ecological pyramids provide other vital information about ecosystem structure
463 Biogeochemical Cycles
Mineral nutrients are cycled through ecosystems and their environment Of particular importance are water
carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur All of these cycles have major impacts on ecosystem structure and
