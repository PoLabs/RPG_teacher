You two wait here Hagrid shouted Stay on the path Ill come back
for yeh
They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking
at each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but the
rustling of leaves around them
You dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered Hermione
I dont care if Malfoy has but if somethings got Neville its our
fault hes here in the first place
The minutes dragged by Their ears seemed sharper than usual Harrys
seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig
What was going on Where were the others
At last a great crunching noise announced Hagrids return Malfoy
Neville and Fang were with him Hagrid was fuming Malfoy it seemed
had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke Neville had
panicked and sent up the sparks
Well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were
makin Right were changin groups  Neville you stay with me an
Hermione Harry you go with Fang an this idiot Im sorry Hagrid
added in a whisper to Harry but hell have a harder time frightenin
you an weve gotta get this done
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang They
walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until
the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so
thick Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker There were
splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been
thrashing around in pain close by Harry could see a clearing ahead
through the tangled branches of an ancient oak
Look  he murmured holding out his arm to stop Malfoy
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground They inched closer
It was the unicorn all right and it was dead Harry had never seen
anything so beautiful and sad Its long slender legs were stuck out at
odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on
