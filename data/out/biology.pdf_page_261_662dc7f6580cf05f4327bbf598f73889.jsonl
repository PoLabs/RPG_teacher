COMMUNICATION
Figure 91 Have you ever become separated from a friend while in a crowd If so you know the challenge of searching
for someone when surrounded by thousands of other people If you and your friend have cell phones your chances
of finding each other are good Cell phone networks use various methods of encoding to ensure that the signals reach
their intended recipients without interference Similarly cells must communicate using specific signals and receptors to
ensure that messages are clear credit modification of work by Vincent and Bella Productions

Introduction
Imagine what life would be like if you and the people around you could not communicate You would not be
able to express your wishes to others nor could you ask questions about your location Social organization is
dependent on communication between the individuals that comprise that society without communication society
would fall apart
As with people it is vital for individual cells to be able to interact with their environment This is true for both a
onecelled organism growing in a puddle and a large animal living on a savanna In order to properly respond
to external stimuli cells have developed complex mechanisms of communication that can receive a message
transfer the information across the plasma membrane and then produce changes within the cell in response to
the message
In multicellular organisms cells send and receive chemical messages constantly to coordinate the actions of
distant organs tissues and cells The ability to send messages quickly and efficiently enables cells to coordinate
and finetune their functions
