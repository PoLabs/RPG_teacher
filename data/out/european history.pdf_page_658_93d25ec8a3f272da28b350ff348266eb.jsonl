to modern economic growth While the former essentially corresponded with 
Malthusian principles ie economic growth was tied to population growth 
due to relatively stable labour productivity with population growth further 
limited by available resources the latter was based on rapid acceleration 
in the efficiency of production thanks to growing labour productivity and 
significant structural changes for example shifts from agriculture to industry 
and services or from individual entrepreneurs or workers to large firms and 
corporations There were indications that the Malthusian trapa theory 
from English economist Thomas Robert Malthus 17661834 that growth 
was ultimately and inevitably capped by limited access to finite resources 
particularly foodwas being broken These indications first appeared in the 
North Sea region of Europe in the eighteenth century but the escape from the 
Malthusian trap remains generally associated with the onset of the industrial 
revolution and industrialisation in Britain Indeed available evidence suggests 
that prior to that moment of industrialisation incomes tended to fluctuate 
from place to place and year to year but due to stable productivity did not 
generally trend upwards 
The new conditions emerging in Britain did not escape the eye of 
contemporary observers Even prior to Malthus Adam Smith 17231790 
articulated a theory of economic growth capturing the change unfolding 
before his eyes What he witnessed in Britain and described in his theory was a 
rise in labour productivity by means of the division of labour specialisation 
which depended on previous accumulation of wealth enabling investments 
necessary for increasing specialisation What is important to note here is 
that Adam Smith articulated his thesis without referring to the early results 
of industrialisation thusrather than addressing technological changehe 
highlighted the emerging institutional framework of commercial capitalism 
It was only the combination of industrialisation the mechanisation 
of production and capitalism that really triggered the historically 
unprecedented era of continuous economic growth in Britain and later in the 
rest of Europe Over the last few decades economic historians have corrected 
often exaggerated estimations of scale of growth in the British economy 
during the Industrial Revolution arguing that even in Britain the change was 
gradual and evolutionary rather than revolutionary in nature That is why 
industrialisation rather than Industrial Revolution is a more appropriate term 
for the process Also the initial belief in the significant role of industry and 
technological change in triggering growth has somewhat waned recently with 
institutional frameworks now being heralded as the crucial variable in the 
onset of industrial capitalism
Between 17001870 the transition to sustained modern economic growth 
spread across the continent from Britain first to Western Europe beginning
