proud of and most fond of recalling long afterwards although he was quite
unimportant in it Actually I may say he put on his ring early in the business and
vanished from sight if not from all danger A magic ring of that sort is not a
complete protection in a goblin charge nor does it stop flying arrows and wild
spears but it does help in getting out of the way and it prevents your head from
being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin swordsman
The elves were the first to charge Their hatred for the goblins is cold and
bitter Their spears and swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame
so deadly was the wrath of the hands that held them As soon as the host of their
enemies was dense in the valley they sent against it a shower of arrows and
each flickered as it fled as if with stinging fire Behind the arrows a thousand of
their spearmen leapt down and charged The yells were deafening The rocks
were stained black with goblin blood
Just as the goblins were recovering from the onslaught and the elfcharge was
halted there rose from across the valley a deepthroated roar With cries of
Moria and Dain Dain the dwarves of the Iron Hills plunged in wielding
their mattocks upon the other side and beside them came the men of the Lake
with long swords
Panic came upon the Goblins and even as they turned to meet this new
attack the elves charged again with renewed numbers Already many of the
goblins were flying back down the river to escape from the trap and many of
their own wolves were turning upon them and rending the dead and the
wounded Victory seemed at hand when a cry rang out on the heights above
Goblins had scaled the Mountain from the other side and already many were
on the slopes above the Gate and others were streaming down recklessly
heedless of those that fell screaming from cliff and precipice to attack the spurs
from above Each of these could be reached by paths that ran down from the
main mass of the Mountain in the centre and the defenders had too few to bar
the way for long Victory now vanished from hope They had only stemmed the
first onslaught of the black tide
Day drew on The goblins gathered again in the valley There a host of Wargs
came ravening and with them came the bodyguard of Bolg goblins of huge size
with scimitars of steel Soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky
while still the great bats swirled about the heads and ears of elves and men or
fastened vampirelike on the stricken Now Bard was fighting to defend the
Eastern spur and yet giving slowly back and the elflords were at bay about
their king upon the southern arm near to the watchpost on Ravenhill
