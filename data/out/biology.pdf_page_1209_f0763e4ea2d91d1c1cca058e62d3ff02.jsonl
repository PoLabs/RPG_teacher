Figure 3823 Sutures are fibrous joints found only in the skull
Syndesmoses are joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue allowing for more
movement than in a suture An example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle
The amount of movement in these types of joints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers
Gomphoses occur between teeth and their sockets the term refers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like
a peg Figure 3824 The tooth is connected to the socket by a connective tissue referred to as the periodontal
ligament

Anatomy
Cartilaginous Joints
Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage There are two types of
cartilaginous joints synchondroses and symphyses In a synchondrosis the bones are joined by hyaline
cartilage Synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children In symphyses
hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage
Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae Either type of cartilaginous joint allows for very little
movement
Synovial Joints
Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones Figure 3825 This space
