that an RNA molecule is the etiological agent of disease The botanist would then need to demonstrate that the RNA
can infect plant cells without a capsid and that the RNA replicates but is not translated to produce proteins

1 Figure 228 The extracellular matrix and outer layer of cells protects the inner bacteria The close proximity of cells
also facilitates lateral gene transfer a process by which genes such as antibioticresistance genes are transferred
from one bacterium to another And even if lateral gene transfer does not occur one bacterium that produces an
exoenzyme that destroys antibiotic may save neighboring bacteria 3 Figure 2219 D 4 A 6 A 8 C

be detected through molecular techniques such as PCR 32 Possible answers include

survival in low humiditywater environment 34 Both bacteria and archaea have cell membranes and they both contain
a hydrophobic portion In the case of bacteria it is a fatty acid in the case of archaea it is a hydrocarbon phytanyl
Both bacteria and archaea have a cell wall that protects them In the case of bacteria it is composed of peptidoglycan
whereas in the case of archaea it is pseudopeptidoglycan polysaccharides glycoproteins or pure protein Bacterial
and archaeal flagella also differ in their chemical structure 36 Responses will vary In a deepsea hydrothermal vent
there is no light so prokaryotes would be chemotrophs instead of phototrophs The source of carbon would be carbon
dioxide dissolved in the ocean so they would be autotrophs There is not a lot of organic material in the ocean
so prokaryotes would probably use inorganic sources thus they would be chemolitotrophs The temperatures are
very high in the hydrothermal vent so the prokaryotes would be thermophilic 38 Losing the bacteria that serve as
decomposers in the ecosystem would disrupt the carbon cycle but not stop it completely since fungi can also serve
as decomposers Without bacterial decomposers functioning organic waste would accumulate in the area and less
carbon dioxide would be released back into the atmosphere
40 E coli colonizes the surface of the leaf forming a
biofilm that is more difficult to remove than free planktonic cells Additionally bacteria can be taken up in the water
that plants are grown in thereby entering the plant tissues rather than simply residing on the leaf surface 42 Soap
indiscriminately kills bacteria on skin This kills harmful bacteria but can also eliminate good bacteria from the skin
When the nonpathogenic bacteria are eliminated pathogenic bacteria can colonize the empty surface

23 Eukaryotic cells arose through endosymbiotic events
that gave rise to the energyproducing organelles within the eukaryotic cells such as mitochondria and chloroplasts
The nuclear genome of eukaryotes is related most closely to the Archaea so it may have been an early archaean
that engulfed a bacterial cell that evolved into a mitochondrion Mitochondria appear to have originated from an
alphaproteobacterium whereas chloroplasts originated as a cyanobacterium There is also evidence of secondary
endosymbiotic events Other cell components may also have resulted from endosymbiotic events 25 The ability to
perform sexual reproduction allows protists to recombine their genes and produce new variations of progeny that may
be better suited to the new environment In contrast asexual reproduction generates progeny that are clones of the
parent 27 Protists are defined as any eukaryotes that do not fall into the Plantae Fungi or Animal Kingdoms Since
the unifying characteristics describe what they are NOT rather than what they are Protista can include almost any
cellularorganism organization Possible examples of structure variety
Barrier to exterior world cell wall plasma
membrane pellicleLocomotion flagella cilia pseudopodia 29 By definition an obligate saprobe lacks the ability to
perform photosynthesis so it cannot directly obtain nutrition by searching for light Instead a chemotactic mechanism
that senses the odors released during decay might be a more effective sensing organ for a saprobe 31 Possible
answers include
Two nuclei a macronucleus and a micronucleus instead of one nucleusAmitotic divisionbinary
fission during asexual reproduction instead of mitotic cell divisionMitosis of the micronucleus after meiosis instead
of direct meiotic production of gametes for sexual reproduction 33 The trypanosomes that cause this disease are
capable of expressing a glycoprotein coat with a different molecular structure with each generation Because the
immune system must respond to specific antigens to raise a meaningful defense the changing nature of trypanosome
antigens prevents the immune system from ever clearing this infection Massive trypanosome infection eventually
leads to host organ failure and death

23 Asexual reproduction is fast and best under favorable conditions Sexual reproduction allows
the recombination of genetic traits and increases the odds of developing new adaptations better suited to a changed
environment 25 Fungi break down decaying matter in their environment to serve as their food source Since the
digestion occurs externally the large mycelium can secrete exoenzymes over a large area The fungi must be able to
absorb the small molecules released by digestion so having a large surface area increases the amount of digested
molecules that are captured by the fungi
