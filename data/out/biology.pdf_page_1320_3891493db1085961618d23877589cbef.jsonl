that respond to antigenpresenting cells Recall that all other nucleated cells of the body expressed MHC I
molecules which signal healthy or normal
Figure 428 An APC such as a macrophage engulfs and digests a foreign bacterium An antigen from the bacterium is
presented on the cell surface in conjunction with an MHC II molecule Lymphocytes of the adaptive immune response
interact with antigenembedded MHC II molecules to mature into functional immune cells
This animation httpopenstaxcollegeorglimmune_system from Rockefeller University shows how
dendritic cells act as sentinels in the bodys immune system
T and B Lymphocytes
Lymphocytes in human circulating blood are approximately 80 to 90 percent T cells shown in Figure 429 and
10 to 20 percent B cells Recall that the T cells are involved in the cellmediated immune response whereas B
cells are part of the humoral immune response
T cells encompass a heterogeneous population of cells with extremely diverse functions Some T cells respond
to APCs of the innate immune system and indirectly induce immune responses by releasing cytokines Other
T cells stimulate B cells to prepare their own response Another population of T cells detects APC signals and
directly kills the infected cells Other T cells are involved in suppressing inappropriate immune reactions to
harmless or self antigens
