He put Hagrids flute to his lips and blew It wasnt really a tune but
from the first note the beasts eyes began to droop Harry hardly drew
breath Slowly the dogs growls ceased  it tottered on its paws and
fell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleep
Keep playing Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and
crept toward the trapdoor They could feel the dogs hot smelly breath
as they approached the giant heads I think well be able to pull the
door open said Ron peering over the dogs back Want to go first
Hermione
No I dont
All right Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogs
legs He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and
open
What can you see Hermione said anxiously
Nothing  just black  theres no way of climbing down well just
have to drop
Harry who was still playing the flute waved at Ron to get his
attention and pointed at himself
You want to go first Are you sure said Ron I dont know how deep
this thing goes Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep
Harry handed the flute over In the few seconds silence the dog
growled and twitched but the moment Hermione began to play it fell
back into its deep sleep
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor There was no
sign of the bottom
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his
fingertips Then he looked up at Ron and said If anything happens to
me dont follow Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to
Dumbledore right
Right said Ron
