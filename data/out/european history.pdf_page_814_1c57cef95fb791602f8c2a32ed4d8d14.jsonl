historians have raised this question and provided different answers to it In his 
groundbreaking LEnfant et la Vie Familiale sous lAncien Rgime 1960known 
in English as Centuries of Childhood 1962Philippe Aris argued that Europe 
had long viewed children as incomplete adults and had discovered the 
child only in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when painters started 
to express the emerging emotional relationship between adults and children 
Although several historians traced the discovery of childhood back to the 
Middle Ages or the ancient world and many historians rightly questioned 
the idea of a sudden birth of childhood the early modern period did witness 
several pivotal events that spurred the interest in children and child education 
Among these events were the rise of print humanism and the Reformation 
The German theologian Martin Luther 14831546 was one of the people 
who explicitly argued that religious and social change depended on the 
education of new generations His view of children was however not very 
optimistic he assumed that children had a natural propensity for doing the 
wrong thing But by firmly drumming the right ideas and knowledge into 
children from their first years onwards people were able to suppress negative 
tendencies and to develop positive alternatives What they learned during 
their childhood Luther argued determined the way they were able to act 
behave and believe as grownup adults
This trust in child education was a driving force behind the rise of schools 
and home education as well as print materials that supported the educational 
practice A genre that also emerged during this period was the household 
manual including instructions and heavily gendered guidance for parents 
The Domostroy Domestic Order that came to be circulated and read widely 
in Muscovite Russia in the 1550s is a curious example of such a manual 
It presents the upperclass Muscovite family as a harmonious miniature 
kingdom led by a goodnatured patriarch and his supportive wife The latter 
was certainly imagined as an aweinspiring authority The wife should 
 teach her servants and children in goodly and valiant fashion it told 
its readers If someone fails to heed her scoldings she must strike him On 
the whole though the book reflected the values of Muscovite merchants and 
clergy rather than those of warriors who otherwise played a dominant role in 
society under Ivan IV 15471584 In matters of childrearing for example it 
emphasised the role of both mothers and fathers very strongly which was less 
pronounced in some Western European contexts at the time 
If God sends anyone children be they sons or daughters then it is up to the father and 
mother to care for to protect their children to raise them to be learned in the good The 
parents must teach them to fear God must instruct them in wisdom and all forms of piety 
According to the childs abilities and age and to the time available the mother should teach 
her daughters female crafts and the father should teach his sons whatever trade they can
