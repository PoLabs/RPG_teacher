19461947 another wave of antisemitic violence against Jewish survivors swept 
over parts of Eastern Europe Many of them emigrated to Western Europe the 
United States or Palestine 
And again just as after the First World War the peace settlements at the 
end of the Second World War forced yet another massive number of people 
to leave their homes The Soviet military campaign had already motivated 
many Germans in Eastern Europe to flee to the East Yet even more followed 
after the Potsdam Agreement of August 1945 which stated that the transfer 
to Germany of German populations  will have to be undertaken This 
led to the expulsion of about 35 million German nationals Volksdeutsche 
from Polish territory 32 million people from Czechoslovakia and about 
225000 people from Hungary Despite the stipulation that this should be 
effected in an orderly and humane manner it is estimated that some two 
million died in the course of these deportations The large majority of these 
Heimatvertriebenen people chased from their homeland settled in the 
western occupation zones bringing the total number of migrants in the newly 
established Federal Republic of Germany to some twelve million people 
The transnational nature of the problem of forced migration during the first 
half of the twentieth century led to the development of institutions dedicated 
to this cause in the context of newly emerging forms of global governance 
The first attempts at the international concertation of migration came in 1921 
when the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen 18611930 was appointed 
High Commissioner on behalf of the League of Nations in connection with 
the problem of Russian refugees This project became further entrenched in 
the Convention Relating to the International Status of Refugees of 28 October 
1933 Yet as the failure of the vian conference in 1938 had demonstrated there 
was no strong commitment to such collective responsibility A more successful 
collaboration only emerged in response to the massive refugee crisis at the end 
of the Second World War when the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation 
Administration UNRRA was established in 1943 Despite its successful 
management of the repatriation of millions of displaced persons it suffered 
from disagreements that worsened due to the emergent Cold War and fell 
apart in 1947 It was replaced by the International Refugee Organization 
which in 1952 in turn made way for the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR
Migration in East and West during the Cold War
From the 1950s onwards migration patterns in Europe started to change After 
more than half a century of often very violent and highly lethal population
