Grain and Wheat
The trade in grain and wheat can illustrate some important elements of 
nineteenthcentury industrial capitalism On the one hand an increase 
in agricultural production and productivity was a precondition for 
industrialisation without which the growing nonagricultural population 
would not have been possible On the other hand the demand for agricultural 
commodities and products of the food industry steadily increased as the 
population especially the urban population and the number of people 
employed in industry increased The result of these mutually reinforcing 
processes was the development of agriculture and the dynamic growth of 
international trade in wheat and other cereals during the long nineteenth 
century Agricultural commodities like wheat and the products of the food 
industry like flour were dominant in international trade and about half of 
the trade was accounted for by these items during the century
Grain trade especially wheat had been booming since the 1840s due to 
the steady and dynamic growth in demand in Western Europe In response 
to expanding demand supply also expanded supported by the continuous 
improvement of transport facilities railway steamship and trade liberalisation 
Along with this intensive trade in cereals markets became more integrated 
which was also reflected in the combined change in prices It was the age of 
the first wave of globalisation and the grain trade was one of the key factors 
of this wave The integrated nature of the grain trade was also demonstrated 
by the early emergence of trade networks In the middle of the century Greek 
merchants were particularly successful in this market Then by the end of the 
century they were replaced by large graintradinghouses modern trading 
companies some of which still exist today 
Trade continued to expand driven mainly by British and then German 
imports and by exports from the Russian and to a lesser extent the Austro
Hungarian Empires later rivalled by exports from Romania The international 
grain trade was mainly an intraEuropean trade until 1914 despite the 
emergence of the United States market as a new exporting country after 
the American Civil War From the 1870s on the large volumes of American 
production as well as growing production from Russia meant a significant 
oversupply of crops in this already integrated grain market resulting in a
