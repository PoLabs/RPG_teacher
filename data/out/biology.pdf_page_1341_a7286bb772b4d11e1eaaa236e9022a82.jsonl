pathogen
pathogenassociated molecular pattern PAMP
stimulates B cells or secretes cytokines to initiate the immune response
an organism that is invaded by a pathogen or parasite
adaptive immune response that is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies
spectrum of maladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign particles or self
antigens occurs after tissue sensitization and includes immediatetype allergy delayedtype and
autoimmunity
acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected
foreign body known not to cause disease or to selfantigens
failure insufficiency or delay at any level of the immune system which may be acquired or
inherited
localized redness swelling heat and pain that results from the movement of leukocytes and fluid
through opened capillaries to a site of infection
immunity that occurs naturally because of genetic factors or physiology and is not induced by
infection or vaccination
cytokine that inhibits viral replication and modulates the immune response
watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain
erythrocytes
leukocyte that is histologically identifiable by its large nuclei it is a small cell with very little
cytoplasm
large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens
protein found on the surface of all nucleated cells I or
specifically on antigenpresenting cells II that signals to immune cells whether the cell is healthynormal or
is infectedcancerous it provides the appropriate template into which antigens can be loaded for
recognition by lymphocytes
leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules such as histamine in response to large pathogens
and allergens
antigenspecific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary
immune response but that can immediately become an effector cell upon reexposure to the same pathogen
type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages
after it moves into infected tissue
collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial
tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body
lymphocyte that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells
phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens
process that enhances phagocytosis using proteins to indicate the presence of a pathogen to
phagocytic cells
transfer of antibodies from one individual to another to provide temporary protection against
pathogens
an agent usually a microorganism that causes disease in the organisms that it invades
carbohydrate polypeptide and nucleic acid signature that
is expressed by viruses bacteria and parasites but differs from molecules on host cells
