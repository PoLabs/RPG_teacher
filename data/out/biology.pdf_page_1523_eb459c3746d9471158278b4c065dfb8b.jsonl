As already mentioned the private nonprofit sector plays a large role in the conservation effort both in North
America and around the world The approaches range from speciesspecific organizations to the broadly
focused IUCN and TRAFFIC The Nature Conservancy takes a novel approach It purchases land and protects
it in an attempt to set up preserves for ecosystems
Although it is focused largely on reducing carbon and related emissions the Paris Climate Agreement is a
significant step toward altering human behavior in a way that should affect biodiversity If the agreement is
successful in its goal of halting global temperature rise many species negatively affected by climate change
may benefit Assessments of the accords implementation will not take place until 2023 and measurement of
its effects will not be feasible for some time However the agreement signed by over 194 countries represents
the worlds most concerted and unified effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions embrace alternative energy
sources and ease climate pressure on ecosystems
Conservation in Preserves
Establishment of wildlife and ecosystem preserves is one of the key tools in conservation efforts A preserve is
an area of land set aside with varying degrees of protection for the organisms that exist within the boundaries
of the preserve Preserves can be effective in the short term for protecting both species and ecosystems but
they face challenges that scientists are still exploring to strengthen their viability as longterm solutions to the
preservation of biodiversity and the prevention of extinction
How Much Area to Preserve
Due to the way protected lands are allocated and the way biodiversity is distributed it is challenging to determine
how much land or marine habitat should be protected The IUCN World Parks Congress estimated that 115
percent of Earths land surface was covered by preserves of various kinds in 2003 We should note that this
area is greater than previous goals however it only includes 9 out of 14 recognized major biomes Similarly
individual animals or types of animals are not equally represented on preserves For example high quality
preserves include only about 50 percent of threatened amphibian species To guarantee that all threatened
species will be properly protected either the protected areas must increase in size or the percentage of high
quality preserves must increase or preserves must be targeted with greater attention to biodiversity protection
Researchers indicate that more attention to the latter solution is required
Preserve Design
There has been extensive research into optimal preserve designs for maintaining biodiversity The fundamental
principle behind much of the research has been the seminal theoretical work of Robert H MacArthur and Edward
O Wilson published in 1967 on island biogeography

This work sought to understand the factors affecting
biodiversity on islands The fundamental conclusion was that biodiversity on an island was a function of the
origin of species through migration speciation and extinction on that island Islands farther from a mainland are
harder to get to so migration is lower and the equilibrium number of species is lower Within island populations
evidence suggests that the number of species gradually increases to a level similar to the numbers on the
mainland from which the species is suspected to have migrated In addition smaller islands are harder to find so
their immigration rates for new species are typically lower Smaller islands are also less geographically diverse
so all things being equal there are fewer niches to promote speciation And finally smaller islands support
smaller populations so the probability of extinction is higher
As islands get larger the number of species able to colonize the island and find suitable niches on the island
increases although the effect of island area on species numbers is not a direct correlation Conservation
preserves can be seen as islands of habitat within an ocean of nonhabitat For a species to persist in a
preserve the preserve must be large enough to support it The critical size depends in part on the home
range that is characteristic of the species A preserve for wolves which range hundreds of kilometers must be
much larger than a preserve for butterflies which might range within ten kilometers during its lifetime But larger
preserves have more core area of optimal habitat for individual species they have more niches to support more
species and they attract more species because they can be found and reached more easily
Preserves perform better when there are buffer zones around them of suboptimal habitat The buffer allows
organisms to exit the boundaries of the preserve without immediate negative consequences from predation or
lack of resources One large preserve is better than the same area of several smaller preserves because there
is more core habitat unaffected by edges For this same reason preserves in the shape of a square or circle will
be better than a preserve with many thin arms If preserves must be smaller then providing wildlife corridors
