RNA Editing in Trypanosomes
The trypanosomes are a group of protozoa that include the pathogen Trypanosoma brucei which causes
nagana in cattle and sleeping sickness in humans throughout great areas of Africa Figure 1512 The
trypanosome is carried by biting flies in the genus Glossina commonly called tsetse flies Trypanosomes
and virtually all other eukaryotes have organelles called mitochondria that supply the cell with chemical
energy Mitochondria are organelles that express their own DNA and are believed to be the remnants
of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote and an engulfed prokaryote The mitochondrial DNA of
trypanosomes exhibit an interesting exception to the central dogma their premRNAs do not have the
correct information to specify a functional protein Usually this is because the mRNA is missing several U
nucleotides The cell performs an additional RNA processing step called RNA editing to remedy this
Figure 1512 Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans The mRNAs of this
pathogen must be modified by the addition of nucleotides before protein synthesis can occur credit modification

Other genes in the mitochondrial genome encode 40 to 80nucleotide guide RNAs One or more of
these molecules interacts by complementary base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the premRNA
transcript However the guide RNA has more A nucleotides than the premRNA has U nucleotides with
which to bind In these regions the guide RNA loops out The 3 ends of guide RNAs have a long polyU tail
and these U bases are inserted in regions of the premRNA transcript at which the guide RNAs are looped
This process is entirely mediated by RNA molecules That is guide RNAsrather than proteinsserve as
the catalysts in RNA editing
RNA editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes In the mitochondria of some plants almost all
premRNAs are edited RNA editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats rabbits and even
humans What could be the evolutionary reason for this additional step in premRNA processing One
possibility is that the mitochondria being remnants of ancient prokaryotes have an equally ancient RNA
based method for regulating gene expression In support of this hypothesis edits made to premRNAs differ
depending on cellular conditions Although speculative the process of RNA editing may be a holdover from
a primordial time when RNA molecules instead of proteins were responsible for catalyzing reactions
5 Capping
While the premRNA is still being synthesized a 7methylguanosine cap is added to the 5 end of the growing
transcript by a phosphate linkage This functional group protects the nascent mRNA from degradation In
addition factors involved in protein synthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes
