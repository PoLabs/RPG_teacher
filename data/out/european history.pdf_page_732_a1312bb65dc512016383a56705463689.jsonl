At the same time Methodism took a clear liberal turn in the face of the 
challenges of industrialised society in line with its engagement with the 
working classes Interdenominational societies promoted the dissemination of 
the Bible and religious treatises as well as the development of education the 
development by an Anglican and a Quaker of the pedagogy known as mutual 
education Under the impetus of female figuresJosephine Butler Elizabeth 
Fry and Florence Nightingalethe defence of prostitutes the improvement 
of prison conditions and the improvement of health care were also important 
concerns Thus far from being merely an opium of the people as Marx 
famously put it religion was at the heart of the debates and conflicts that 
shook nineteenthcentury European societies A force for conservatism or 
even reaction but also a force for progress and social reform religion adapted 
its messages and structures to the new context sketched out by urbanisation 
and industrialisation 
Conclusion
As it entered industrial and political modernity Europe saw the rise of new 
approaches to religion For Marx religion was an opium of the people in the 
sense that religion was used by those in power to oppress workers and that it 
brought spiritual comfort that distracted the proletariat from the revolution In 
the struggle between conservatism and liberalism churches have more often 
than not weighed in on the side of the status quo But churches have also been 
on the side of emancipation and social progress fighting for human dignity 
building school systems and providing assistance to the poor
After a century of political turmoil of economic and social change 
religious practices were radically transformed Challenged by the affirmation 
of scientific and rationalist understanding of the world religions were also 
weakened by industrialisation and urbanisation In response new forms of 
piety have tried to adapt to a changing context
