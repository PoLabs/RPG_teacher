Save me save me cried Nibs falling on the ground
But what can we do what can we do
It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their
thoughts turned to him
What would Peter do they cried simultaneously
Almost in the same breath they cried Peter would look at them
through his legs
And then Let us do what Peter would do
It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves and as one
boy they bent and looked through their legs The next moment is the
long one but victory came quickly for as the boys advanced upon
them in the terrible attitude the wolves dropped their tails and fled
Now Nibs rose from the ground and the others thought that his
staring eyes still saw the wolves But it was not wolves he saw
I have seen a wonderfuller thing he cried as they gathered
round him eagerly A great white bird It is flying this way
What kind of a bird do you think
I dont know Nibs said awestruck but it looks so weary and
as it flies it moans Poor Wendy
Poor Wendy
I remember said Slightly instantly there are birds called
Wendies
See it comes cried Curly pointing to Wendy in the heavens
Wendy was now almost overhead and they could hear her
plaintive cry But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell
The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship and was
darting at her victim from every direction pinching savagely each
time she touched
Hullo Tink cried the wondering boys
Tinks reply rang out Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy
It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered Let us
do what Peter wishes cried the simple boys Quick bows and
arrows
All but Tootles popped down their trees He had a bow and arrow
with him and Tink noted it and rubbed her little hands
Quick Tootles quick she screamed Peter will be so pleased
Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow Out of the way
Tink he shouted and then he fired and Wendy fluttered to the
ground with an arrow in her breast
