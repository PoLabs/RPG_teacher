Asexual Ascomycota and Basidiomycota
Imperfect fungithose that do not display a sexual phasewere formerly classified in the form phylum
Deuteromycota an invalid taxon no longer used in the present everdeveloping classification of organisms
While Deuteromycota was once a classification taxon recent molecular analysis has shown that some of the
members classified in this group belong to the Ascomycota Figure 2418 or the Basidiomycota Because some
members of this group have not yet been appropriately classified they are less well described in comparison to
members of other fungal taxa Most imperfect fungi live on land with a few aquatic exceptions They form visible
mycelia with a fuzzy appearance and are commonly known as mold
Figure 2418 Aspergillus Aspergillus niger is an asexually reproducing fungus phylum Ascomycota commonly found
as a food contaminant The spherical structure in this light micrograph is an asexual conidiophore Molecular studies
have placed Aspergillus with the ascomycetes and sexual cycles have been identified in some species credit

The fungi in this group have a large impact on everyday human life The food industry relies on them for ripening
some cheeses The blue veins in Roquefort cheese and the white crust on Camembert are the result of fungal
growth The antibiotic penicillin was originally discovered on an overgrown Petri plate on which a colony of
Penicillium fungi had killed the bacterial growth surrounding it Other fungi in this group cause serious diseases
either directly as parasites which infect both plants and humans or as producers of potent toxic compounds
as seen in the aflatoxins released by fungi of the genus Aspergillus
Glomeromycota
The Glomeromycota is a newly established phylum that comprises about 230 species all of which are involved
in close associations with the roots of trees Fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share
a long evolutionary history It appears that nearly all members of this family form arbuscular mycorrhizae
the hyphae interact with the root cells forming a mutually beneficial association in which the plants supply the
carbon source and energy in the form of carbohydrates to the fungus and the fungus supplies essential minerals
from the soil to the plant The exception is Geosiphon pyriformis which hosts the cyanobacterium Nostoc as an
endosymbiont
The glomeromycetes do not reproduce sexually and do not survive without the presence of plant roots Although
they have coenocytic hyphae like the zygomycetes they do not form zygospores DNA analysis shows that all
glomeromycetes probably descended from a common ancestor making them a monophyletic lineage
243  Ecology of Fungi
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the role of fungi in various ecosystems

Describe mutualistic relationships of fungi with plant roots and photosynthetic organisms

Describe the beneficial relationship between some fungi and insects
