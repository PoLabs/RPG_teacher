A perfect representative of the French Enlightenment Diderot did not 
however advocate the introduction of a constitution In the twilight of the 
ancien rgime the French constitutionalist movement was poorly represented 
because it required specific prolegomena on freedom but also a more detailed 
reflection on inequality between men From this point of view Rousseau 
considers two kinds of inequality physical and political the latter consisting 
of the different privileges which some men enjoy to the prejudice of others 
Discourse on the Origin of Inequality among Men 1755 The French politician 
and philosopher Gabriel Bonnot de Mably 17091785 later translated this into 
less abstract terms the distinction between nobles and commoners can only 
be the result of several events and revolutions from which the vanity of some 
citizens took advantage to attribute particular prerogatives to themselves and

distinction between society and government society is produced by our

intellectual challenges The ideal of good government established during the 
Middle Ages was challenged by the promotion of Christian individualism and 
the resulting demand for freedom Defining princely virtues and supporting 
them with faith or reason was only a fraction of the process The res publica
