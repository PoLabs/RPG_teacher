constructions This gave all women the opportunity to question their own 
assumptions about their supposedly natural limitations
This path led to an unrelenting rise in the access of women to the world 
of nondomestic work but at the same time it revealed certain challenges 
that remained unresolved even at the end of the century In particular the 
double burden of balancing professional and personal life has made it hard 
to reconcile a maternal desire with work aspirations Thus there continues to 
be a very clear dividing line between those who opt for the domestic sphere 
and those who choose the public sphere
Marriage and Family Law 
The twentieth century witnessed competing movements of liberalisation and 
reaction in terms of marriage and family law that roughly mirrored the waves 
of revolution war and the growth of new ideologies across the continent 
Prior to the First World War a number of countries experienced a push to 
democratise divorce and improve the rights of women within and beyond 
marriage and the results of these movements continued into the interwar era 
For example in Britain women were unable to hold property in their own 
names upon marriage until 1870 and it took several reforms up until 1926 
for married women to have the same rights to own and dispose of property as 
men Similarly divorce was uncommon and expensive prior to the First World 
War It took a number of legal reforms to make it more accessible including 
laws in 1923 and 1937 that first allowed women to end their marriages if their 
husbands committed adultery and also enabled partners to split on grounds 
including cruelty desertion and insanity
Both World Wars alongside the prolonged period of economic decline 
between them generated reactions against the growing role of women outside 
the home and more generally against the supposed breakdown of what many 
perceived as the traditional family This movement cut across the political 
spectrum and across the continent from liberal Britain to fascist Italy and 
Germany as well as the Soviet Union One impetus for the movement to uphold 
this ideal of the family was the fact that so many marriages had broken down 
during the war through abandonment separation or death on the battlefield 
For example in Germany the marriage rate almost halved between 1913 and 
1916 In the interwar period a number of different measures around Europe 
encouraged families to have more children and women to stay at home 
These included marriage bars that prevented married women from taking 
up certain jobs such as working for the post office and family allowances or 
even prizes to encourage women to have more children Fascist Italy famously 
introduced a bachelor tax to encourage men to settle down and start families
