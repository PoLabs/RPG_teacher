own households This meant that time was needed to train work and save 
enough to do so While households in Eastern Europe consisted largely of 
family members related by blood west of the socalled Hajnal line livein 
servants and lodgers frequently extended the otherwise nuclear family ie 
a married couple and their children These servants were often although not 
always young employees working for wages This system led to a lifecycle in 
which a period of service was the norm in northwest Europe as opposed to 
the situation in Eastern Europe At almost all levels of society families in north
west Europe sent their adolescent children out of their households to work as 
servants or apprentices to board near a teacher or school or to perform service 
for royalty This mobility was notable to visitors from further afield Lifecycle 
service died out with the shift from preindustrial to industrialised production 
techniques which was detrimental to the position of women as they no longer 
had access to labour markets in which to gain skills and earn wages 
In addition to pointing out the significance of marriage patterns research 
has been conducted on the legal and confessional dimensions of marriage 
Very often religious conversion was a precondition to marriage The existence 
of denominationally mixed marriages demonstrates how fluid confessional 
identities could be in the early modern context Dowries had to be negotiated 
in each case but economic considerations were not the only connection 
between spouses In cases of domestic violence or other marital conflict 
divorce was only possible in Protestant countries In Catholic areas it was 
sometimes possible to obtain a dispensation on proof of an unconsummated 
marriage or to demand separation from table and bed before a church court 
The petitions and testimonies required in the context of investigations and 
court trials provide insights into what early modern people had to say about 
their everyday married life What often emerges is that those living in the early 
modern period had a lot more agency than we might sometimes assume 
and that particularly women petitioned courts to uphold promises of marriage 
where they had not been fulfilled and they were left literally holding the baby
An important feature of how the lifecycles of households were arranged 
is what happened after death Although life expectancy at birth for the early 
modern period sat at around thirty to thirtyfive years of age most individuals 
who survived infancy could expect to live much longerperhaps to around 
the age of sixty This also meant that some degree of old age care provision was 
often necessary In the Netherlands early forms of retirement homes emerged 
where elderly couples could pay in advance for care In many other parts of 
Europe care by family members remained the norm These patterns of what 
different generations do for each other and how they live together have long 
historical roots with ramifications right through to the present day In Spain 
and Italy for example even the state provision of old age care today is heavily
