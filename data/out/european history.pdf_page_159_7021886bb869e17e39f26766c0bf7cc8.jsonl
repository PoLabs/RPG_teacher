With regard to Britain data from British parish registers indicates that over the 
early modern period the average gap between births dropped by eight percent

3054 months between births by the end of the eighteenth century This means 
thaton averagewomen had three fewer months between pregnancies 
which over the course of a lifetime could significantly increase total fertility 
Looking beyond the British and French cases detailed fertility data for other

mortality many women did not reach the end of their childbearing years

Mortality 
Death rates in early modern Europe gradually declined across most of the 
continent from the high Middle Ages ca 1000 onward However there 
were numerous exceptional periods tied to weather events or environmental 
crises epidemics and military conflicts all of which could result in privation 
malnutrition and famine Extreme weather during the growing season or 
during the harvest the passing of an army or simply a lack of hands to carry 
out the necessary preparation of the soil the sowing or the harvesting could 
cause crises of crop production which in some cases could endanger the 
very survival of a certain group Crises connected to crop failures recurrently
