up you get
She turned to the rest of the class
None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing You
leave those brooms where they are or youll be out of Hogwarts before
you can say Quidditch Come on dear
Neville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with
Madam Hooch who had her arm around him
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter
Did you see his face the great lump
The other Slytherins joined in
Shut up Malfoy snapped Parvati Patil
Ooh sticking up for Longbottom said Pansy Parkinson a hardfaced
Slytherin girl Never thought youd like fat little crybabies
Parvati
Look said Malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the
grass Its that stupid thing Longbottoms gran sent him
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up
Give that here Malfoy said Harry quietly Everyone stopped talking
to watch
Malfoy smiled nastily
I think Ill leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find  how about 
up a tree
Give it here Harry yelled but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick
and taken off He hadnt been lying he could fly well Hovering level
with the topmost branches of an oak he called Come and get it
Potter
Harry grabbed his broom
