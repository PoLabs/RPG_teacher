correct thing asked Peter how old he was It was not really a happy
question to ask him it was like an examination paper that asks
grammar when what you want to be asked is Kings of England
I dont know he replied uneasily but I am quite young He
really knew nothing about it he had merely suspicions but he said at
a venture Wendy I ran away the day I was born
Wendy was quite surprised but interested and she indicated in the
charming drawingroom manner by a touch on her nightgown that
he could sit nearer her
It was because I heard father and mother he explained in a low
voice talking about what I was to be when I became a man He
was extraordinarily agitated now I dont want ever to be a man he
said with passion I want always to be a little boy and to have fun
So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time
among the fairies
She gave him a look of the most intense admiration and he
thought it was because he had run away but it was really because he
knew fairies Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies
struck her as quite delightful She poured out questions about them
to his surprise for they were rather a nuisance to him getting in his
way and so on and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding
Still he liked them on the whole and he told her about the beginning
of fairies
You see Wendy when the first baby laughed for the first time its
laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about
and that was the beginning of fairies
Tedious talk this but being a stayathome she liked it
And so he went on goodnaturedly there ought to be one fairy
for every boy and girl
Ought to be Isnt there
No You see children know such a lot now they soon dont
believe in fairies and every time a child says I dont believe in
fairies there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead
Really he thought they had now talked enough about fairies and it
struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet I cant think
where she has gone to he said rising and he called Tink by name
Wendys heart went flutter with a sudden thrill
Peter she cried clutching him you dont mean to tell me that
there is a fairy in this room
She was here just now he said a little impatiently You dont
hear her do you and they both listened
The only sound I hear said Wendy is like a tinkle of bells
Well thats Tink thats the fairy language I think I hear her too
The sound came from the chest of drawers and Peter made a
merry face No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter and the
loveliest of gurgles was his laugh He had his first laugh still
Wendy he whispered gleefully I do believe I shut her up in the
drawer
He let poor Tink out of the drawer and she flew about the nursery
screaming with fury You shouldnt say such things Peter retorted
