Figure 324 Peptide bond formation is a dehydration synthesis reaction The carboxyl group of one amino acid is linked
to the incoming amino acids amino group In the process it releases a water molecule
The products that such linkages form are peptides As more amino acids join to this growing chain the resulting
chain is a polypeptide Each polypeptide has a free amino group at one end This end the N terminal or
the amino terminal and the other end has a free carboxyl group also the C or carboxyl terminal While the
terms polypeptide and protein are sometimes used interchangeably a polypeptide is technically a polymer of
amino acids whereas the term protein is used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have combined together
often have bound nonpeptide prosthetic groups have a distinct shape and have a unique function After
protein synthesis translation most proteins are modified These are known as posttranslational modifications
They may undergo cleavage phosphorylation or may require adding other chemical groups Only after these
modifications is the protein completely functional

The Evolutionary Significance of Cytochrome c
Cytochrome c is an important component of the electron transport chain a part of cellular respiration and
it is normally located in the cellular organelle the mitochondrion This protein has a heme prosthetic group
and the hemes central ion alternately reduces and oxidizes during electron transfer Because this essential
proteins role in producing cellular energy is crucial it has changed very little over millions of years Protein
sequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of cytochrome c amino acid sequence homology
among different species In other words we can assess evolutionary kinship by measuring the similarities
or differences among various species DNA or protein sequences
Scientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino acids For each cytochrome c
molecule from different organisms that scientists have sequenced to date 37 of these amino acids appear in
the same position in all cytochrome c samples This indicates that there may have been a common ancestor
On comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences scientists did not find a sequence difference
When researchers compared human and rhesus monkey sequences the single difference was in one amino
acid In another comparison human to yeast sequencing shows a difference in the 44th position
