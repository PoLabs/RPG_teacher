The Life Cycle of an Angiosperm
The adult or sporophyte phase is the main phase of an angiosperms life cycle Figure 2615 Like
gymnosperms angiosperms are heterosporous Therefore they produce microspores which will generate
pollen grains as the male gametophytes and megaspores which will form an ovule that contains female
gametophytes Inside the anthers microsporangia male sporocytes divide by meiosis to generate haploid
microspores which in turn undergo mitosis and give rise to pollen grains Each pollen grain contains two cells
one generative cell that will divide into two sperm and a second cell that will become the pollen tube cell
