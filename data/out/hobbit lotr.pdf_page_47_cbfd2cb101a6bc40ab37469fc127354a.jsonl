a bit and sing with us or will you go straight on Supper is preparing over
there he said I can smell the woodfires for the cooking
Tired as he was Bilbo would have liked to stay a while Elvish singing is not
a thing to miss in June under the stars not if you care for such things Also he
would have liked to have a few private words with these people that seemed to
