KEY TERMS
range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation absorbed by a given substance
pigment molecule that directly absorbs light and transfers the energy absorbed to other
pigment molecules
lightindependent reactions of photosynthesis that convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
into carbohydrates using the energy and reducing power of ATP and NADPH
process of converting inorganic CO2 gas into organic compounds
photosynthetic pigment yelloworangered that functions to dispose of excess energy
organism that can build organic molecules using energy derived from inorganic chemicals
instead of sunlight
form of chlorophyll that absorbs violetblue and red light and consequently has a bluishgreen
color the only pigment molecule that performs the photochemistry by getting excited and losing an electron
to the electron transport chain
accessory pigment that absorbs blue and redorange light and consequently has a yellowish
green tint
organelle in which photosynthesis takes place
group of reversibly oxidizable and reducible proteins that forms part of the electron
transport chain between photosystem II and photosystem I
range of all possible frequencies of radiation
group of proteins between PSII and PSI that pass energized electrons and use the
energy released by the electrons to move hydrogen ions against their concentration gradient into the
thylakoid lumen
stack of thylakoids located inside a chloroplast
organism that consumes organic substances or other organisms for food
complex that passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center in each
photosystem it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300 to 400 chlorophyll a and
b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids
first stage of photosynthesis where certain wavelengths of the visible light are
absorbed to form two energycarrying molecules ATP and NADPH
second stage of photosynthesis through which carbon dioxide is used to build
carbohydrate molecules using energy from ATP and NADPH
middle layer of chlorophyllrich cells in a leaf
reaction center of photosystem II
reaction center of photosystem I
ejection of an electron from a reaction center using the energy of an absorbed photon
organism capable of producing its own organic compounds from sunlight
distinct quantity or packet of light energy
group of proteins chlorophyll and other pigments that are used in the lightdependent reactions
of photosynthesis to absorb light energy and convert it into chemical energy
