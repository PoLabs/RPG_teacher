Notably the Catholic Church encouraged its followers to militate against 
secularist and anticlerical tendencies In Protestant regions of Europe a 
new kind of conservative party came to the fore challenging the legacy of 
nineteenthcentury revolutions They mobilised their middle and lowerclass 
supporters to demand political rights and to act against the liberal state A
