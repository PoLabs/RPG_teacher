glucose C6H12O6 Because this process involves synthesizing a larger energystoring molecule it requires an
energy input to proceed The following equation notice that it is the reverse of the previous equation describes
the synthesis of glucose

During photosynthesis chemical reactions energy is in the form of a very highenergy molecule scientists call
ATP or adenosine triphosphate This is the primary energy currency of all cells Just as the dollar is the currency
we use to buy goods cells use ATP molecules as energy currency to perform immediate work The sugar
glucose is stored as starch or glycogen Energystoring polymers like these break down into glucose to supply
ATP molecules
Solar energy is required to synthesize a glucose molecule during the photosynthesis reactions In
photosynthesis light energy from the sun initially transforms into chemical energy that temporally stores itself in
the energy carrier molecules ATP and NADPH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate Photosynthesis
later uses the stored energy in ATP and NADPH to build one glucose molecule from six molecules of CO2 This
process is analogous to eating breakfast in the morning to acquire energy for your body that you can use later in
the day Under ideal conditions energy from 18 molecules of ATP is required to synthesize one glucose molecule
during photosynthesis reactions Glucose molecules can also combine with and convert into other sugar types
When an organism consumes sugars glucose molecules eventually make their way into each organisms living
cell Inside the cell each sugar molecule breaks down through a complex series of chemical reactions The goal
of these reactions is to harvest the energy stored inside the sugar molecules The harvested energy makes high
energy ATP molecules which perform work powering many chemical reactions in the cell The amount of energy
needed to make one glucose molecule from six carbon dioxide molecules is 18 ATP molecules and 12 NADPH
molecules each one of which is energetically equivalent to three ATP molecules or a total of 54 molecule
equivalents required for synthesizing one glucose molecule This process is a fundamental and efficient way for
cells to generate the molecular energy that they require

Metabolic Pathways
The processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two types of metabolic pathways
A metabolic pathway is a series of interconnected biochemical reactions that convert a substrate molecule
or molecules stepbystep through a series of metabolic intermediates eventually yielding a final product
or products In the case of sugar metabolism the first metabolic pathway synthesized sugar from smaller
molecules and the other pathway broke sugar down into smaller molecules Scientists call these two opposite
processesthe first requiring energy and the second producing energyanabolic building and catabolic
breaking down pathways respectively Consequently building anabolism and degradation catabolism
comprise metabolism
