biological study of animal behavior
accelerating growth pattern seen in species under conditions where resources are not
limiting
potential reproductive capacity of an individual
series of instinctual behaviors that once initiated always goes to completion regardless of
changes in the environment
behaviors species use to find food
species which often forms the major structural portion of the habitat
ability of a species to ignore repeated stimuli that have no consequence
organism a parasite lives on
identification of parents by newborns as the first organism they see after birth
instinctual behavior that is not altered by changes in the environment
selection of a desirable mate of the opposite sex
competition between species for resources in a shared habitat or environment
competition between members of the same sex for a mate
competition between members of the same species
study of life on island chains and how their geography interacts with the diversity of
species found there
life history strategy characterized by multiple reproductive events during the lifetime of a species
shape of an exponential growth curve
species suited to stable environments that produce a few relatively large offspring and
provide parental care
species whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity in an ecosystem and to upholding
an ecological communitys structure
sacrificing ones own life so that ones genes will be passed on to future generations by relatives
undirected movement of an organism in response to a stimulus
behavior that responds to changes in the environment
inherited pattern of resource allocation under the influence of natural selection and other
evolutionary forces
