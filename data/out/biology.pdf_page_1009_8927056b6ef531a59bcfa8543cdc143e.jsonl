KEY TERMS
fruit derived from tissues other than the ovary
fruit that develops from multiple carpels in the same flower
single layer of cells just inside the seed coat that secretes enzymes upon germination
sum of all the stamens in a flower
the three cells away from the micropyle
process by which seeds are produced without fertilization of sperm and egg
covering of the shoot tip found in germinating monocot seeds
covering of the root tip found in germinating monocot seeds
fleshy part of seed that provides nutrition to the seed
transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of a different flower
method of asexual reproduction where a portion of the stem contains nodes and internodes is placed in
moist soil and allowed to root
period of no growth and very slow metabolic processes
two fertilization events in angiosperms one sperm fuses with the egg forming the zygote
whereas the other sperm fuses with the polar nuclei forming endosperm
innermost part of fruit
triploid structure resulting from fusion of a sperm with polar nuclei which serves as a nutritive tissue
for embryo
dicot that stores food reserves in the endosperm
embryonic shoot above the cotyledons
outermost covering of pollen
outermost covering of a fruit
multicellular stage of the plant that gives rise to haploid gametes or spores
method of asexual reproduction where the stem from one plant species is spliced to a different plant
response of a plant growth in the same direction as gravity
the sum of all the carpels in a flower
embryonic axis above the cotyledons
inner lining of the pollen
method of propagating plants by bending a stem under the soil
second phase of female gametophyte development during which the surviving haploid
megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eightnucleate sevencell female gametophyte also known
as the megagametophyte or embryo sac
tissue found in the ovary that gives rise to the female gamete or egg
