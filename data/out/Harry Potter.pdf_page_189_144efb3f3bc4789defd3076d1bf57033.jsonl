I  I know I cant keep him forever but I cant jus dump him I
cant
Harry suddenly turned to Ron Charlie he said
Youre losing it too said Ron Im Ron remember
No  Charlie  your brother Charlie In Romania Studying dragons
We could send Norbert to him Charlie can take care of him and then put
him back in the wild
Brilliant said Ron How about it Hagrid
And in the end Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to
ask him
The following week dragged by Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry
sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to
bed The clock on the wall had just
chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open Ron appeared out of
nowhere as he pulled off Harrys invisibility cloak He had been down at
Hagrids hut helping him feed Norbert who was now eating dead rats by
the crate
It bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a
bloody handkerchief Im not going to be able to hold a quill for a
week I tell you that dragons the most horrible animal Ive ever met
but the way Hagrid goes on about it youd think it was a fluffy little
bunny rabbit When it bit me he told me off for frightening it And when
I left he was singing it a lullaby
There was a tap on the dark window
Its Hedwig said Harry hurrying to let her in Shell have
Charlies answer
The three of them put their heads together to read the note
Dear Ron
How are you Thanks for the letter  Id be glad to take the Norwegian
Ridgeback but it wont be easy getting him here I think the best thing
