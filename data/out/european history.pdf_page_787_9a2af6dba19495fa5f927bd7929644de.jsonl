63 CENTRES AND PERIPHERIES

was Orthodox Christian Muslim and Buddhist nobles and clergy for 
example had more limited privileges while others including the Protestant 
Baltic Germans actually enjoyed more privileges than most Russians As for 
the rural population there were so many legal differences between Russian 
Orthodox and nonOrthodox peasants and between stateowned peasants and 
privatelyowned serfs that the category of peasant meant little Cossacks and 
inorodtsy literally those of other descent a term that captured some but 
not all nonRussians formed separate legal categories altogether Footnotes 
in legal texts made sure that many rights were withheld from the Jewish 
population Ethnoreligious differences were thus just as important as social 
distinctions in imperial society Unlike many Western monarchies the Russian 
Empire took pride in its cultural diversity and flaunted it wherever possible
while privileging the Russian Orthodox Since some Russian regions had 
large percentages even majorities of nonRussians the legal status of these 
communities would also shape the relationship between Moscow St Petersburg 
and their various peripheries Moreover the reality of large indigenous 
communities and predominantly Russianstaffed local administrations would 
raise the question of which peripheries were also Russian colonies 
Eventually the centres advance across Eurasia along with improvements in 
cartography led the geographer and statesman Vasily Tatishchev 16861750 
to give impetus in the 1730s to an intellectual debate about Russias true centre 
and periphery By selecting the Ural Mountains as the natural border between 
Europe and Asia he not only divided Russia into a European and an Asiatic 
partthereby confirming the European identity of St Petersburgs elites
but he also turned the land beyond the mountains into the empires ultimate 
periphery Talk of Russias interior provinces inside its European half would 
soon become commonplace The debate on Russianness however along with 
extensive discussions of Russias geographical core and peripheries would 
not gather full pace until the nineteenth century
Conclusion
In early modern Europe with few exceptions the development of core
periphery relations was shaped by centralisation which gradually supplanted 
earlier forms of local autonomy The cases of France and Russia however 
also show that this process was neither completed nor uncontested Local 
institutions demands and thinking had to be accommodated to a degree and 
left strong legacies from territorial privilege and constitutional thought to the 
realisation that the centres power was sometimes elusive and often negotiable 
Early modern states were more open than their modern successors and less
