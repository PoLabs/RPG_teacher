UNIT 6 LIVING WITH DIFFERENCE

younger generation of party members in Eastern Europe who had hoped 
to create a communism with a human face until their hopes were crushed 
through repression first in Hungary in 1956 and again during the Prague 
Spring in 1968 
Elsewhere in Europe 1968 was the starting point for a range of new 
ideological experiments in which liberation was primarily defined as 
breaking the chains of prejudice regarding gender sexual orientation skin 
colour physical abilities and psychological normality These emancipatory 
ideals fuelled the mobilisation of new social movements some of which like 
the feminist movement and the black liberation movement were not actually 
new Others like the gay and antipsychiatry movements exemplified new 
characteristics not just in terms of their aims but also by their turn from 
collective emancipation to individual liberation 
This diversity gave the new ideologies of the 1970s an ambivalent character 
On the one hand they demonstrated a truly global orientation These 
ideologies put transnational issues on the agenda including the protection of 
the natural environment resistance against nuclear energy and the campaign 
for nuclear disarmament reaching far beyond the borders of nationstates 
Another global impetus was the connection of the fight against racism and 
capitalism with the struggle against colonialism and imperialismincluding 
the cultural imperialism ascribed to the Pax Americana that undergirded the 
liberaldemocratic consensus of the postwar period
On the other hand however the new ideologies were decisively 
individualistic based on the idea that collective social and global change began 
with individual reformation This individualisation of ideological convictions 
made it increasingly problematic to formulate a common denominator for 
political mobilisation with a devastating impact on the loyalty of voters to 
established political parties In the end the individualist streak of the new 
social movements also created a fertile breeding ground for the ideology that 
took over the world from 1980 onwards neoliberalism
Neoliberalism
Although neoliberalism gained ground in the slipstreams of Ronald Reagan 
in the US and Margaret Thatcher in the UK its pedigree was much older The 
concept was first coined in 1938 and its main ideas were further developed 
in the 1940s and 1950s by Friedrich Hayek Wilhelm Rpke James Buchanan 
and Milton Friedman Even though the core of the neoliberal creed was 
the conviction that the market offered the most efficient mechanism for the 
distribution of goods it rejected the classical liberal orthodoxy of laissez
faire The market was superior but also vulnerable and inherently unstable
