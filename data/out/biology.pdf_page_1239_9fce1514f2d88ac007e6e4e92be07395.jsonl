look like tiny bubbles within the sacs Alveoli are in direct contact with capillaries onecell thick of the circulatory
system Such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from alveoli into the blood and be distributed to
the cells of the body In addition the carbon dioxide that was produced by cells as a waste product will diffuse
from the blood into alveoli to be exhaled The anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli emphasizes
the structural and functional relationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems Because there are so many
alveoli 300 million per lung within each alveolar sac and so many sacs at the end of each alveolar duct the
lungs have a spongelike consistency This organization produces a very large surface area that is available
for gas exchange The surface area of alveoli in the lungs is approximately 75 m2 This large surface area
combined with the thinwalled nature of the alveolar parenchymal cells allows gases to easily diffuse across the
cells
Figure 3910 Terminal bronchioles are connected by respiratory bronchioles to alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs Each
alveolar sac contains 20 to 30 spherical alveoli and has the appearance of a bunch of grapes Air flows into the atrium
of the alveolar sac then circulates into alveoli where gas exchange occurs with the capillaries Mucous glands secrete
mucous into the airways keeping them moist and flexible credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal

Protective Mechanisms
The air that organisms breathe contains particulate matter such as dust dirt viral particles and bacteria that
can damage the lungs or trigger allergic immune responses The respiratory system contains several protective
mechanisms to avoid problems or tissue damage In the nasal cavity hairs and mucus trap small particles
viruses bacteria dust and dirt to prevent their entry
If particulates do make it beyond the nose or enter through the mouth the bronchi and bronchioles of the
lungs also contain several protective devices The lungs produce mucusa sticky substance made of mucin
a complex glycoprotein as well as salts and waterthat traps particulates The bronchi and bronchioles contain
