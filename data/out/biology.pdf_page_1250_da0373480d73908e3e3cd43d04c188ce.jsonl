Figure 3918 The ratio of FEV1 the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled in one second after taking a deep
breath to FVC the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled can be used to diagnose whether a person has
restrictive or obstructive lung disease In restrictive lung disease FVC is reduced but airways are not obstructed so
the person is able to expel air reasonably fast In obstructive lung disease airway obstruction results in slow exhalation
as well as reduced FVC Thus the FEV1FVC ratio is lower in persons with obstructive lung disease less than 69
percent than in persons with restrictive disease 88 to 90 percent
Dead Space VQ Mismatch
Pulmonary circulation pressure is very low compared to that of the systemic circulation It is also independent
of cardiac output This is because of a phenomenon called recruitment which is the process of opening
airways that normally remain closed when cardiac output increases As cardiac output increases the number
of capillaries and arteries that are perfused filled with blood increases These capillaries and arteries are not
always in use but are ready if needed At times however there is a mismatch between the amount of air
ventilation V and the amount of blood perfusion Q in the lungs This is referred to as ventilationperfusion
VQ mismatch
There are two types of VQ mismatch Both produce dead space regions of broken down or blocked lung
tissue Dead spaces can severely impact breathing because they reduce the surface area available for gas
diffusion As a result the amount of oxygen in the blood decreases whereas the carbon dioxide level increases
Dead space is created when no ventilation andor perfusion takes place Anatomical dead space or anatomical
shunt arises from an anatomical failure while physiological dead space or physiological shunt arises from a
functional impairment of the lung or arteries
An example of an anatomical shunt is the effect of gravity on the lungs The lung is particularly susceptible to
changes in the magnitude and direction of gravitational forces When someone is standing or sitting upright the
pleural pressure gradient leads to increased ventilation further down in the lung As a result the intrapleural
pressure is more negative at the base of the lung than at the top and more air fills the bottom of the lung
than the top Likewise it takes less energy to pump blood to the bottom of the lung than to the top when in
a prone position Perfusion of the lung is not uniform while standing or sitting This is a result of hydrostatic
forces combined with the effect of airway pressure An anatomical shunt develops because the ventilation of
the airways does not match the perfusion of the arteries surrounding those airways As a result the rate of gas
exchange is reduced Note that this does not occur when lying down because in this position gravity does not
preferentially pull the bottom of the lung down
A physiological shunt can develop if there is infection or edema in the lung that obstructs an area This will
decrease ventilation but not affect perfusion therefore the VQ ratio changes and gas exchange is affected
The lung can compensate for these mismatches in ventilation and perfusion If ventilation is greater than
perfusion the arterioles dilate and the bronchioles constrict This increases perfusion and reduces ventilation
Likewise if ventilation is less than perfusion the arterioles constrict and the bronchioles dilate to correct the
imbalance
