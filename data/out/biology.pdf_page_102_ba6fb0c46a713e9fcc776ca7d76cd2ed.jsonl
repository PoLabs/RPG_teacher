Figure 326 The beta chain of hemoglobin is 147 residues in length yet a single amino acid substitution leads to sickle
cell anemia In normal hemoglobin the amino acid at position seven is glutamate In sickle cell hemoglobin a valine
replaces glutamate
Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain hemoglobin molecules form long fibers that distort the
biconcave or discshaped red blood cells and causes them to assume a crescent or sickle shape which clogs
blood vessels Figure 327 This can lead to myriad serious health problems such as breathlessness dizziness
headaches and abdominal pain for those affected by this disease
Figure 327 In this blood smear visualized at 535x magnification using bright field microscopy sickle cells are crescent
shaped while normal cells are discshaped credit modification of work by Ed Uthman scalebar data from Matt

Secondary Structure
The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein The
most common are the helix and pleated sheet structures Figure 328 Both structures are held in shape
by hydrogen bonds The hydrogen bonds form between the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group in one amino
acid and another amino acid that is four amino acids farther along the chain
