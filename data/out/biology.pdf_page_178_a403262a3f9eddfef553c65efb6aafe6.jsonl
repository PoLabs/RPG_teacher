KEY TERMS
method of transporting material that requires energy
molecule possessing a polar or charged area and a nonpolar or uncharged area capable of
interacting with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments
transporter that carries two ions or small molecules in different directions
channel protein that allows water through the membrane at a very high rate
membrane protein that moves a substance across the plasma membrane by changing its own
shape
protein that coats the plasma membranes cytoplasmic side and participates in the liquid uptake
process by potocytosis
membrane protein that allows a substance to pass through its hollow core across the plasma
membrane
protein that coats the plasma membranes inwardfacing surface and assists in forming specialized
structures like coated pits for phagocytosis
area of high concentration adjacent to an area of low concentration
passive transport process of lowmolecular weight material according to its concentration gradient
a combined electrical and chemical force that produces a gradient
pump that creates a charge imbalance
type of active transport that moves substances including fluids and particles into a cell
process of passing bulk material out of a cell
process by which material moves down a concentration gradient from high to low
concentration using integral membrane proteins
describes the plasma membranes structure as a mosaic of components including
phospholipids cholesterol proteins glycoproteins and glycolipids sugar chains attached to proteins or
lipids respectively resulting in a fluid character fluidity
combination of carbohydrates and lipids
combination of carbohydrates and proteins
molecule with the ability to bond with water waterloving
molecule that does not have the ability to bond with water waterhating
situation in which extracellular fluid has a higher osmolarity than the fluid inside the cell resulting in
water moving out of the cell
situation in which extracellular fluid has a lower osmolarity than the fluid inside the cell resulting in
water moving into the cell
protein integrated into the membrane structure that interacts extensively with the membrane
lipids hydrocarbon chains and often spans the membrane
situation in which the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the fluid inside the cell resulting in
no net water movement into or out of the cell
total amount of substances dissolved in a specific amount of solution
