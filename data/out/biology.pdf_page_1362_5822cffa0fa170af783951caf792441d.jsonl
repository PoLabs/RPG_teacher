Menopause
As women approach their mid40s to mid50s their ovaries begin to lose their sensitivity to FSH and LH
Menstrual periods become less frequent and finally cease this is menopause There are still eggs and potential
follicles on the ovaries but without the stimulation of FSH and LH they will not produce a viable egg to be
released The outcome of this is the inability to have children
The side effects of menopause include hot flashes heavy sweating especially at night headaches some hair
loss muscle pain vaginal dryness insomnia depression weight gain and mood swings Estrogen is involved
in calcium metabolism and without it blood levels of calcium decrease To replenish the blood calcium is lost
from bone which may decrease the bone density and lead to osteoporosis Supplementation of estrogen in the
form of hormone replacement therapy HRT can prevent bone loss but the therapy can have negative side
effects While HRT is thought to give some protection from colon cancer osteoporosis heart disease macular
degeneration and possibly depression its negative side effects include increased risk of stroke or heart attack
blood clots breast cancer ovarian cancer endometrial cancer gall bladder disease and possibly dementia
