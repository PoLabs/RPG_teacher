demographic engineers and decided to expel those who were unwelcome due 
to their religious identity while new fellow nationals could be drawn from 
adherents of their own group The most prominent case of this unmixing of 
peoples is the TurkishGreek population exchange as sanctioned ex post facto 
in the Treaty of Lausanne 1924 nearly all Muslims had to leave Greece and 
were brought to Anatolia and Eastern Thrace while conversely all Christians 
were expelled from presentday Turkeywith some exceptions like the 
autochthonous Greek Orthodox inhabitants of Istanbul the Greek nation
state would become a Christian state while Turkey saw itself as a Muslim 
state However the interwar period saw a much broader series of resettlement 
agreements in the postOttoman sphere Each of the respective groups for 
resettlement was defined according to religious affiliation Examples include 
the TurkishRomanian agreement on the resettlement of tens of thousands 
of Romanian Muslims in 1935 or the TurkishYugoslav agreement targeting 
200000 Muslims from Yugoslavia
While these deportations and resettlements did not include plans for 
killings religious affiliation alone turned out to be a death sentence for millions 
of people in this period particularly in the case of the Armenian Genocide 
and the Holocaust also called Shoah During the Armenian Genocide from 
19151916 nearly the entire Armenian Christian population of the remaining 
Ottoman Empire was extinguished whether directly or indirectly In the same 
context members of other Christian denominations were targeted like the 
Syriac Christians of SouthEastern Anatolia It is estimated that at least one 
million Armenians died while the death toll for Syriac Christians amounted 
to around 250000 people The most wellknown case of genocide according to 
religious affiliation is the Holocaust nearly the entire German and European 
Jewry at least six million were killed
Catholic Identities in Europe after the Second World War
The Second Vatican Council 19621965 profoundly changed the direction 
in which Catholicism was evolving perhaps to an extent comparable to the 
Council of Trent 15451563 The Second Vatican Council is undoubtedly the 
most significant event in the history of the Catholic Church in the twentieth 
century symbolising its openness to the modern world and contemporary 
culture taking technological progress the emancipation of peoples and 
increasing secularisation into account As a result of years of hard work 
and discussion by more than 2000 participants the council adopted many 
dogmatic texts among which the four constitutions had a major impact 
The first Sacrosanctum Concilium 1963 marks the end of the Latin Mass It 
is in fact devoted to the renovation and simplification of the rites allowing 
for celebration in vernacular languages and thus greater participation of
