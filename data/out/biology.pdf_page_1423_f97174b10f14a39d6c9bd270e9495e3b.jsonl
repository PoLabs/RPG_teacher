individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time usually with data compiled from a life table
These curves allow us to compare the life histories of different populations Figure 456 Humans and most
primates exhibit a Type I survivorship curve because a high percentage of offspring survive their early and middle
yearsdeath occurs predominantly in older individuals These types of species usually have small numbers of
offspring at one time and they give a high amount of parental care to them to ensure their survival Birds are
an example of an intermediate or Type II survivorship curve because birds die more or less equally at each age
interval These organisms also may have relatively few offspring and provide significant parental care Trees
marine invertebrates and most fishes exhibit a Type III survivorship curve because very few of these organisms
survive their younger years however those that make it to an old age are more likely to survive for a relatively
long period of time Organisms in this category usually have a very large number of offspring but once they are
born little parental care is provided Thus these offspring are on their own and vulnerable to predation but
their sheer numbers assure the survival of enough individuals to perpetuate the species
Figure 456 Survivorship curves show the distribution of individuals in a population according to age Humans and
most mammals have a Type I survivorship curve because death primarily occurs in the older years Birds have a Type
II survivorship curve as death at any age is equally probable Trees have a Type III survivorship curve because very
few survive the younger years but after a certain age individuals are much more likely to survive
452  Life Histories and Natural Selection
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how life history patterns are influenced by natural selection

Explain different life history patterns and how different reproductive strategies affect species survival
A species life history describes the series of events over its lifetime such as how resources are allocated
for growth maintenance and reproduction Life history traits affect the life table of an organism A species life
history is genetically determined and shaped by the environment and natural selection
Life History Patterns and Energy Budgets
Energy is required by all living organisms for their growth maintenance and reproduction at the same time
energy is often a major limiting factor in determining an organisms survival Plants for example acquire energy
from the sun via photosynthesis but must expend this energy to grow maintain health and produce energyrich
seeds to produce the next generation Animals have the additional burden of using some of their energy reserves
to acquire food Furthermore some animals must expend energy caring for their offspring Thus all species
have an energy budget they must balance energy intake with their use of energy for metabolism reproduction
parental care and energy storage such as bears building up body fat for winter hibernation
