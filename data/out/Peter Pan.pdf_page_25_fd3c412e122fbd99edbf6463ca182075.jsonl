several times and found that they could sleep thus with security
Indeed they would have slept longer but Peter tired quickly of
sleeping and soon he would cry in his captain voice We get off
here So with occasional tiffs but on the whole rollicking they
drew near the Neverland for after many moons they did reach it
and what is more they had been going pretty straight all the time
not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as
because the island was looking for them It is only thus that any one
may sight those magic shores
There it is said Peter calmly
Where where
Where all the arrows are pointing
Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the
children all directed by their friend the sun who wanted them to be
sure of their way before leaving them for the night
Wendy and John and Michael stood on tiptoe in the air to get their
first sight of the island Strange to say they all recognized it at once
and until fear fell upon them they hailed it not as something long
dreamt of and seen at last but as a familiar friend to whom they were
returning home for the holidays
John theres the lagoon
Wendy look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand
I say John I see your flamingo with the broken leg
Look Michael theres your cave
John whats that in the brushwood
Its a wolf with her whelps Wendy I do believe thats your little
whelp
Theres my boat John with her sides stove in
No it isnt Why we burned your boat
Thats her at any rate I say John I see the smoke of the redskin
camp
Where Show me and Ill tell you by the way smoke curls
whether they are on the warpath
There just across the Mysterious River
I see now Yes they are on the warpath right enough
Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much but if
he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand for have I not
told you that anon fear fell upon them
It came as the arrows went leaving the island in gloom
In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a
little dark and threatening by bedtime Then unexplored patches
arose in it and spread black shadows moved about in them the roar
of the beasts of prey was quite different now and above all you lost
the certainty that you would win You were quite glad that the night
lights were on You even liked Nana to say that this was just the
mantelpiece over here and that the Neverland was all makebelieve
Of course the Neverland had been makebelieve in those days but
it was real now and there were no nightlights and it was getting
darker every moment and where was Nana
