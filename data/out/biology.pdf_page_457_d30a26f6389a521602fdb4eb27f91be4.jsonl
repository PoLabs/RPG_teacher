165  Eukaryotic Posttranscriptional Gene Regulation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Understand RNA splicing and explain its role in regulating gene expression

Describe the importance of RNA stability in gene regulation
RNA is transcribed but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin This processing
that takes place after an RNA molecule has been transcribed but before it is translated into a protein is
called posttranscriptional modification As with the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing this post
transcriptional step can also be regulated to control gene expression in the cell If the RNA is not processed
shuttled or translated then no protein will be synthesized
RNA Splicing the First Stage of Posttranscriptional Control
In eukaryotic cells the RNA transcript often contains regions called introns that are removed prior to translation
The regions of RNA that code for protein are called exons Figure 1610 After an RNA molecule has been
transcribed but prior to its departure from the nucleus to be translated the RNA is processed and the introns
are removed by splicing Splicing is done by spliceosomes ribonucleoprotein complexes that can recognize the
two ends of the intron cut the transcript at those two points and bring the exons together for ligation
Figure 1610 PremRNA can be alternatively spliced to create different proteins
