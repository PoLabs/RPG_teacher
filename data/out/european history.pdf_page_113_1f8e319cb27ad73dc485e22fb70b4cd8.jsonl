13 MIGRATION

While Great Britain put an end to the free movement of Indians in 1947 after 
Indian Independence France on the contrary introduced agreements with its 
former colonies that became independent in the early 1960s allowing entry 
into French territory without a visa or residence permit This liberal migration 
policy was brutally curtailed with the 19731974 oil crisis Restrictive measures 
were put in place in the early 1990s transforming those nationals of territories 
which had formerly enjoyed a form of imperial citizenship into foreigners
Conclusion
The end of the twentieth century in stark contrast to its beginnings has been 
characterised by free peaceful and voluntary movement The end of the 
Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain in 19891990 ushered in a period of 
seemingly frictionless mobility in the supranational framework of the European 
Union The adoption of the Schengen Agreement 1985 and Convention 1990 
opened up an area of free movement between EU member states but also put 
in place compensatory measures to secure external borders and prevent them 
from being crossed by nationals of nonmember countries 
With the Eastern enlargement of 2004 and 2007 which brought the states 
of the former Eastern Bloc into the fold Europeans were free to travel and 
work throughout their continent Turkey had already been granted candidate 
status in 1999 promising to expand the area of free movement beyond the 
continent The nation state which had played such a pivotal role in the control 
of migration throughout the century seemed to have been relegated to the 
sidelines of European history 
The beginning of the twentyfirst century has clouded this optimistic 
image Migration has once more become a contentious issue the socalled 
refugee crisis of 2015the mass migration of people fleeing wars and unrest 
in the Middle Eastarguably led to a rise in populism and polarisation in 
European politics Frontex the agency that has been operating the integrated 
management of Europes borders since 2005 has been strengthened and 
expanded since 2016 It embodies a migration policy that turns the Schengen 
Area into what is sometimes called Fortress Europe a tightly sealed self
contained and exclusive space Migration also played a central role in the 2016 
referendum on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU with the 
potential accession of Turkey treated as a particularly threatening prospect 
despite the fact that accession negotiations have stalled for years Yet these 
contemporary concerns pale in comparison to the staggering numbers of 
people forced to migrate around into and out of Europe over the course of the 
violent twentieth century
