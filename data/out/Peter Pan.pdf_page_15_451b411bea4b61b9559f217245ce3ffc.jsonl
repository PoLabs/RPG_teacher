Peter could be exceeding polite also having learned the grand
manner at fairy ceremonies and he rose and bowed to her
beautifully She was much pleased and bowed beautifully to him
from the bed
Whats your name he asked
Wendy Moira Angela Darling she replied with some
satisfaction What is your name
Peter Pan
She was already sure that he must be Peter but it did seem a
comparatively short name
Is that all
Yes he said rather sharply He felt for the first time that it was a
shortish name
Im so sorry said Wendy Moira Angela
It doesnt matter Peter gulped
She asked where he lived
Second to the right said Peter and then straight on till
morning
What a funny address
Peter had a sinking For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a
funny address
No it isnt he said
I mean Wendy said nicely remembering that she was hostess
is that what they put on the letters
He wished she had not mentioned letters
Dont get any letters he said contemptuously
But your mother gets letters
Dont have a mother he said Not only had he no mother but he
had not the slightest desire to have one He thought them very over
rated persons Wendy however felt at once that she was in the
presence of a tragedy
O Peter no wonder you were crying she said and got out of
bed and ran to him
I wasnt crying about mothers he said rather indignantly I was
crying because I cant get my shadow to stick on Besides I wasnt
crying
It has come off
Yes
Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor looking so draggled
and she was frightfully sorry for Peter How awful she said but
she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to
stick it on with soap How exactly like a boy
Fortunately she knew at once what to do It must be sewn on
she said just a little patronisingly
Whats sewn he asked
Youre dreadfully ignorant
No Im not
