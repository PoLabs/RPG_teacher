in nitrogen some fungi resort to predation of nematodes small nonsegmented roundworms In fact species
of Arthrobotrys fungi have a number of mechanisms to trap nematodes One mechanism involves constricting
rings within the network of hyphae The rings swell when they touch the nematode gripping it in a tight hold The
fungus then penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized hyphae called haustoria Many parasitic
fungi possess haustoria as these structures penetrate the tissues of the host release digestive enzymes within
the hosts body and absorb the digested nutrients
Reproduction
Fungi reproduce sexually andor asexually Perfect fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually while the so
called imperfect fungi reproduce only asexually by mitosis
In both sexual and asexual reproduction fungi produce spores that disperse from the parent organism by either
floating on the wind or hitching a ride on an animal Fungal spores are smaller and lighter than plant seeds For
example the giant puffball mushroom bursts open and releases trillions of spores in a massive cloud of what
looks like finely particulate dust The huge number of spores released increases the likelihood of landing in an
environment that will support growth Figure 246

Asexual Reproduction
Fungi reproduce asexually by fragmentation budding or producing spores Fragments of hyphae can grow new
colonies Somatic cells in yeast form buds During budding an expanded type of cytokinesis a bulge forms on
the side of the cell the nucleus divides mitotically and the bud ultimately detaches itself from the mother cell
