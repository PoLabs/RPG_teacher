size Scientists then transfer the fragments in the gel onto a nylon membrane in a procedure we call blotting
Figure 176 Scientists can then probe the nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the membranes surface
with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences When scientists transfer DNA to a nylon
membrane they refer to the technique as Southern blotting When they transfer the RNA to a nylon membrane
they call it Northern blotting Scientists use Southern blots to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in
a given genome and Northern blots to detect gene expression
Figure 176 Scientists use Southern blotting to find a particular sequence in a DNA sample Scientists separate DNA
fragments on a gel transfer them to a nylon membrane and incubate them with a DNA probe complementary to the
sequence of interest Northern blotting is similar to Southern blotting but scientists run RNA on the gel instead of DNA
In Western blotting scientists run proteins on a gel and detect them using antibodies
Molecular Cloning
In general the word cloning means the creation of a perfect replica however in biology the recreation of
a whole organism is referred to as reproductive cloning Long before attempts were made to clone an entire
organism researchers learned how to reproduce desired regions or fragments of the genome a process that is
referred to as molecular cloning
Cloning small genome fragments allows researchers to manipulate and study specific genes and their protein
products or noncoding regions in isolation A plasmid or vector is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates
independently of the chromosomal DNA In cloning scientists can use the plasmid molecules to provide a
folder in which to insert a desired DNA fragment Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for
proliferation In the bacterial context scientists call the DNA fragment from the human genome or the genome
of another studied organism foreign DNA or a transgene to differentiate it from the bacteriums DNA or the
host DNA
Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations such as Escherichia coli and have genes that can contribute
favorable traits to the organism such as antibiotic resistance the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics
Scientists have repurposed and engineered plasmids as vectors for molecular cloning and the largescale
production of important reagents such as insulin and human growth hormone An important feature of plasmid
vectors is the ease with which scientists can introduce a foreign DNA fragment via the multiple cloning
site MCS The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that different commonly available
restriction endonucleases can cut Restriction endonucleases recognize specific DNA sequences and cut
them in a predictable manner They are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against
foreign DNA Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two DNA strands such that the
cut ends have a 2 or 4base singlestranded overhang Because these overhangs are capable of annealing
with complementary overhangs we call them sticky ends Adding the enzyme DNA ligase permanently joins
the DNA fragments via phosphodiester bonds In this way scientists can splice any DNA fragment generated
by restriction endonuclease cleavage between the plasmid DNAs two ends that has been cut with the same
restriction endonuclease Figure 177
Recombinant DNA Molecules
Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they are
created artificially and do not occur in nature They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of
different molecule parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or
even to chemical synthesis We call proteins that are expressed from recombinant DNA molecules recombinant
