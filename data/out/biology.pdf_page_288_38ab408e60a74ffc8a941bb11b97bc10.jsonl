30 If a cell developed a mutation in its MAP2K1
gene encodes the MEK protein that prevented MEK
from being recognized by phosphatases how would
the EGFR signaling cascade and the cells behavior
change
31 What is a possible result of a mutation in a kinase
that controls a pathway that stimulates cell growth
32 How does the extracellular matrix control the
growth of cells
33 A scientist notices that a cancer cell line shows
high levels of phosphorylated ERK in the absence of
EGF What are two possible explanations for the
increase in phosphorylated ERK Be specific in
which proteins are involved
34 What characteristics make yeasts a good model
for learning about signaling in humans
35 Why is signaling in multicellular organisms more
complicated than signaling in singlecelled
organisms
36 Pseudomonas infections are very common in
hospital settings Why would it be important for
doctors to determine the bacterial load before
treating an infected patient
