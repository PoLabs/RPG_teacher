hydrogen H which is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons
Figure 22 Elements such as helium depicted here are made up of atoms Atoms are made up of protons and
neutrons located within the nucleus with electrons in orbitals surrounding the nucleus
Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass about 167  1024 grams Scientists arbitrarily define
this amount of mass as one atomic mass unit amu or one Dalton as Table 22 shows Although similar in
mass protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge A proton is positively charged whereas a neutron
is uncharged Therefore the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass but not to its
charge Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons weighing only 911  1028 grams or about 11800 of
an atomic mass unit Hence they do not contribute much to an elements overall atomic mass Therefore when
considering atomic mass it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons and calculate the atoms mass
based on the number of protons and neutrons alone Although not significant contributors to mass electrons do
contribute greatly to the atoms charge as each electron has a negative charge equal to the protons positive
charge In uncharged neutral atoms the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of
protons inside the nucleus In these atoms the positive and negative charges cancel each other out leading to
an atom with no net charge
Accounting for the sizes of protons neutrons and electrons most of the atoms volumegreater than 99
percentis empty space With all this empty space one might ask why socalled solid objects do not just pass
through one another The reason they do not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged
and negative charges repel each other

Atomic Number and Mass
Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons The number of protons
determines an elements atomic number which scientists use to distinguish one element from another The
number of neutrons is variable resulting in isotopes which are different forms of the same atom that vary only
in the number of neutrons they possess Together the number of protons and neutrons determine an elements
mass number as Figure 23 illustrates Note that we disregard the small contribution of mass from electrons in
calculating the mass number We can use this approximation of mass to easily calculate how many neutrons an
element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number Since an elements isotopes
will have slightly different mass numbers scientists also determine the atomic mass which is the calculated
mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes Often the resulting number contains a fraction
