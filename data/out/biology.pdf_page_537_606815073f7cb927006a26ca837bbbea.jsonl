Geographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those
populations We see such geographical variation between most populations and it can be significant We
can observe one type of geographic variation a cline as given species populations vary gradually across an
ecological gradient Species of warmblooded animals for example tend to have larger bodies in the cooler
climates closer to the earths poles allowing them to better conserve heat This is a latitudinal cline Alternatively
flowering plants tend to bloom at different times depending on where they are along a mountain slope This is an
altitudinal cline
If there is gene flow between the populations the individuals will likely show gradual differences in phenotype
along the cline Restricted gene flow alternatively can lead to abrupt differences even speciation
193  Adaptive Evolution
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain the different ways natural selection can shape populations

Describe how these different forces can lead to different outcomes in terms of the population variation
Natural selection only acts on the populations heritable traits selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing
their frequency in the population while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their
frequency Scientists call this process adaptive evolution Natural selection does not act on individual alleles
but on entire organisms An individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that
for example increases the ability to reproduce fecundity but if that same individual also carries an allele that
results in a fatal childhood disease that fecundity phenotype will not pass to the next generation because the
individual will not live to reach reproductive age Natural selection acts at the individuals level It selects for
individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next generation Scientists call this an organisms
evolutionary Darwinian fitness
Fitness is often quantifiable and is measured by scientists in the field However it is not an individuals absolute
fitness that counts but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population Scientists call this
concept relative fitness which allows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional
offspring to the next generation and thus how the population might evolve
There are several ways selection can affect population variation stabilizing selection directional selection
diversifying selection frequencydependent selection and sexual selection As natural selection influences
the allele frequencies in a population individuals can either become more or less genetically similar and the
phenotypes can become more similar or more disparate
