Figure 1418 In mismatch repair the incorrectly added base is detected after replication The mismatch repair proteins
detect this base and remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease action The gap is now filled with the
correctly paired base
Another type of repair mechanism nucleotide excision repair is similar to mismatch repair except that it is
used to remove damaged bases rather than mismatched ones The repair enzymes replace abnormal bases by
making a cut on both the 3 and 5 ends of the damaged base Figure 1419 The segment of DNA is removed
and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol Once the bases are filled in the
remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester linkage catalyzed by DNA ligase This repair mechanism is often
employed when UV exposure causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers
