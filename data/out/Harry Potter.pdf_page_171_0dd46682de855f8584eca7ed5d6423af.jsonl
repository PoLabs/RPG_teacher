I dont need a cloak to become invisible said Dumbledore gently
Now can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all
Harry shook his head
Let me explain The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it
and see himself exactly as he is Does that help
Harry thought Then he said slowly It shows us what we want
whatever we want
Yes and no said Dumbledore quietly It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts You who have
never known your family see them standing around you Ronald Weasley
who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing
alone the best of all of them However this mirror will give us
neither knowledge or truth Men have wasted away before it entranced by
what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is
real or even possible
The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow Harry and I ask you
not to go looking for it again If you ever do run across it you will
now be prepared It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live
remember that Now why dont you put that admirable cloak back on and
get off to bed
Harry stood up
Sir  Professor Dumbledore Can I ask you something
Obviously youve just done so Dumbledore smiled You may ask me one
more thing however
What do you see when you look in the mirror
I I see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks
Harry stared
One can never have enough socks said Dumbledore Another Christmas
has come and gone and I didnt get a single pair People will insist on
giving me books
