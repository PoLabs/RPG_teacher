Ecosystem Ecology
Ecosystem ecology is an extension of organismal population and community ecology The ecosystem is
composed of all the biotic components living things in an area along with the abiotic components nonliving
things of that area Some of the abiotic components include air water and soil Ecosystem biologists ask
questions about how nutrients and energy are stored and how they move among organisms and through the
surrounding atmosphere soil and water
The Karner blue butterflies and the wild lupine live in an oakpine barren habitat This habitat is characterized by
natural disturbance and nutrientpoor soils that are low in nitrogen The availability of nutrients is an important
factor in the distribution of the plants that live in this habitat Researchers interested in ecosystem ecology could
ask questions about the importance of limited resources and the movement of resources such as nutrients
though the biotic and abiotic portions of the ecosystem
Ecologist
A career in ecology contributes to many facets of human society Understanding ecological issues can help
society meet the basic human needs of food shelter and health care Ecologists can conduct their research
in the laboratory and outside in natural environments Figure 445 These natural environments can be as
close to home as the stream running through your campus or as far away as the hydrothermal vents at the
bottom of the Pacific Ocean Ecologists manage natural resources such as whitetailed deer populations
Odocoileus virginianus for hunting or aspen Populus spp timber stands for paper production Ecologists
also work as educators who teach children and adults at various institutions including universities high
schools museums and nature centers Ecologists may also work in advisory positions assisting local state
and federal policymakers to develop laws that are ecologically sound or they may develop those policies
and legislation themselves To become an ecologist requires at least an undergraduate degree usually in a
natural science The undergraduate degree is often followed by specialized training or an advanced degree
depending on the area of ecology selected Ecologists should also have a broad background in the physical
sciences as well as a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics
