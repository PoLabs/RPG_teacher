and from sewage causes excessive growth of microorganisms and depletes the dissolved oxygen which leads
to the death of many ecosystem fauna such as shellfish and finfish This process is responsible for dead zones
in lakes and at the mouths of many major rivers Figure 4619

microorganisms which depletes oxygen and kills fauna Worldwide large dead zones are found in coastal areas of

As discussed earlier a dead zone is an area within a freshwater or marine ecosystem where large areas are
depleted of their normal flora and fauna these zones can be caused by eutrophication oil spills dumping of
toxic chemicals and other human activities The number of dead zones has been increasing for several years
and more than 400 of these zones were present as of 2008 One of the worst dead zones is off the coast of the
United States in the Gulf of Mexico where fertilizer runoff from the Mississippi River basin has created a dead
zone of over 8463 square miles Phosphate and nitrate runoff from fertilizers also negatively affect several lake
and bay ecosystems including the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States
