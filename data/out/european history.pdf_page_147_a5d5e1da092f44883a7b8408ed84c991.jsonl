motherland The antiAmericanism of the extreme left characterised the non
democratic US as the leading state of capitalist exploitation oppression 
colonialism see Figure  and consumer culture where everything was for 
sale and culture was degraded to a common commodity While this version of 
antiAmericanism already existed in the interwar period it strengthened and 
spread through Europe after the Second World War Jazz for example was 
banned in some socialist countries until the late 1950s and early 1960s because

young people showed much more positive attitudes toward the US than old

relatively homogeneous bloc assuming their national identities to be rooted 
in the shared colonial past and associated Spanish and Portuguese heritage 
Simplistic references to Latin America exclude strong legacies of Amerindian 
and African communities in the history and culture of these nations such
