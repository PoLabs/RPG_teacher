Introduction
During the nineteenth century Europe underwent a profound social political 
economic and technological transformation The continents cities grew into 
global centres of industry and were at the same time shaken by waves of social 
unrest and political revolutions New modes of transport such as locomotives 
and steamboats offered increased mobility to a growing number of people 
while the electric telegraph sped up global communications These changes 
were not always welcomed the misery of the growing working class in 
particular gave rise to radical ideas of social reform and practical experiments 
of more communal and egalitarian ways of living 
During this tumultuous time an understanding of the avantgarde as 
an opposition to dominant bourgeois norms and values and of the artist as 
an agent of change took shape This idea reflected the feelings of upheaval 
that European societies were experiencing and closely linked art and society 
Following the ideas of the French theorist Henri de SaintSimon 17601825 
it was another Frenchman the mathematician and social reformer Olinde 
Rodrigues 17951851 who first used the term avantgarde in this sense in 
1825 The revolutions of 1848 and the Paris Commune of 1871 were defining 
moments in which art attained a new status as a force for change
While the idea of a socially engaged art was an important aspect of the 
avantgarde many progressive artists focused more on formal revolution 
and innovation leading to a long succession of artistic ismsrealism 
impressionism naturalismwhich would come to be seen as an essential 
characteristic of modern art According to the influential literary scholar Peter 
Brger it was during the nineteenth century that art became an autonomous 
institution Rather than merely serving the Church or the aristocracy art was 
now practised for its own sake invested with purely aesthetic value
