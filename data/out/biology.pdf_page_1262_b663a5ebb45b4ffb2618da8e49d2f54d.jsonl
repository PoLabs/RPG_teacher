401  Overview of the Circulatory System
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe an open and closed circulatory system

Describe interstitial fluid and hemolymph

Compare and contrast the organization and evolution of the vertebrate circulatory system
In all animals except a few simple types the circulatory system is used to transport nutrients and gases through
the body Simple diffusion allows some water nutrient waste and gas exchange into primitive animals that
are only a few cell layers thick however bulk flow is the only method by which the entire body of larger more
complex organisms is accessed
Circulatory System Architecture
The circulatory system is effectively a network of cylindrical vessels the arteries veins and capillaries that
emanate from a pump the heart In all vertebrate organisms as well as some invertebrates this is a closed
loop system in which the blood is not free in a cavity In a closed circulatory system blood is contained
inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around the systemic circulatory route then
returns to the heart again as illustrated in Figure 402a As opposed to a closed system arthropodsincluding
insects crustaceans and most molluskshave an open circulatory system as illustrated in Figure 402b In
an open circulatory system the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called
a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid As the heart beats
and the animal moves the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters the
hearts through openings called ostia This movement allows for gas and nutrient exchange An open circulatory
system does not use as much energy as a closed system to operate or to maintain however there is a tradeoff
with the amount of blood that can be moved to metabolically active organs and tissues that require high levels
of oxygen In fact one reason that insects with wing spans of up to two feet wide 70 cm are not around today
is probably because they were outcompeted by the arrival of birds 150 million years ago Birds having a closed
circulatory system are thought to have moved more agilely allowing them to get food faster and possibly to prey
on the insects
Figure 402 In a closed circulatory systems the heart pumps blood through vessels that are separate from the
interstitial fluid of the body Most vertebrates and some invertebrates like this annelid earthworm have a closed
circulatory system In b open circulatory systems a fluid called hemolymph is pumped through a blood vessel that
empties into the body cavity Hemolymph returns to the blood vessel through openings called ostia Arthropods like
this bee and most mollusks have open circulatory systems
Circulatory System Variation in Animals
The circulatory system varies from simple systems in invertebrates to more complex systems in vertebrates
The simplest animals such as the sponges Porifera and rotifers Rotifera do not need a circulatory system
because diffusion allows adequate exchange of water nutrients and waste as well as dissolved gases as
shown in Figure 403a Organisms that are more complex but still only have two layers of cells in their body
