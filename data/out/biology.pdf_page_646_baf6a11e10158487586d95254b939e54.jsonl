Secondary Endosymbiosis in Chlorarachniophytes
Endosymbiosis involves one cell engulfing another to produce over time a coevolved relationship in which
neither cell could survive alone The chloroplasts of red and green algae for instance are derived from the
engulfment of a photosynthetic cyanobacterium by an ancestral prokaryote
This evidence suggests the possibility that an ancestral cell already containing a photosynthetic
endosymbiont was engulfed by another eukaryote cell resulting in a secondary endosymbiosis Molecular
and morphological evidence suggest that the chlorarachniophyte protists are derived from a secondary
endosymbiotic event Chlorarachniophytes are rare algae indigenous to tropical seas and sand They
are classified into the Rhizarian supergroup Chlorarachniophytes are reticulose amoebae extending thin
cytoplasmic strands that interconnect them with other chlorarachniophytes in a cytoplasmic network These
protists are thought to have originated when a eukaryote engulfed a green alga the latter of which had
previously established an endosymbiotic relationship with a photosynthetic cyanobacterium Figure 236
Figure 236 Secondary endosymbiosis The hypothesized process of several endosymbiotic events leading to
the evolution of chlorarachniophytes is shown In a primary endosymbiotic event a heterotrophic eukaryote
consumed a cyanobacterium In a secondary endosymbiotic event the cell resulting from primary endosymbiosis
was consumed by a second cell The resulting organelle became a plastid in modern chlorarachniophytes
Several lines of evidence support that chlorarachniophytes evolved from secondary endosymbiosis The
chloroplasts contained within the green algal endosymbionts still are capable of photosynthesis making
chlorarachniophytes photosynthetic The green algal endosymbiont also exhibits a vestigial nucleus In fact
it appears that chlorarachniophytes are the products of an evolutionarily recent secondary endosymbiotic
event The plastids of chlorarachniophytes are surrounded by four membranes The first two correspond
to the inner and outer membranes of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium the third corresponds to plasma
membrane of the green alga and the fourth corresponds to the vacuole that surrounded the green
alga when it was engulfed by the chlorarachniophyte ancestor In other lineages that involved secondary
endosymbiosis only three membranes can be identified around plastids This is currently interpreted as a
sequential loss of a membrane during the course of evolution
The process of secondary endosymbiosis is not unique to chlorarachniophytes Secondary plastids are also
found in the Excavates and the Chromalveolates In the Excavates secondary endosymbiosis of green
algae led to euglenid protists while in the Chromalveolates secondary endosymbiosis of red algae led to
the evolution of plastids in dinoflagellates apicomplexans and stramenopiles
