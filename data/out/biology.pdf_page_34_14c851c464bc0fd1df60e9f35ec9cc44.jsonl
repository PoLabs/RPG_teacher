are present not only in animals but also in plants An organ system is a higher level of organization that
consists of functionally related organs Mammals have many organ systems For instance the circulatory system
transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs It includes organs such as the heart and blood
vessels Organisms are individual living entities For example each tree in a forest is an organism Singlecelled
prokaryotes and singlecelled eukaryotes are also organisms which biologists typically call microorganisms
Biologists collectively call all the individuals of a species living within a specific area a population For example
a forest may include many pine trees which represent the population of pine trees in this forest Different
populations may live in the same specific area For example the forest with the pine trees includes populations
of flowering plants insects and microbial populations A community is the sum of populations inhabiting a
particular area For instance all of the trees flowers insects and other populations in a forest form the forests
community The forest itself is an ecosystem An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area
together with the abiotic nonliving parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water At the
highest level of organization Figure 116 the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems and it represents
the zones of life on Earth It includes land water and even the atmosphere to a certain extent
Figure 116 shows the biological levels of organization of living things From a single organelle to the entire
biosphere living organisms are parts of a highly structured hierarchy credit organelles modification of work by

Which of the following statements is false
a
Tissues exist within organs which exist within organ systems
b
Communities exist within populations which exist within ecosystems
c
Organelles exist within cells which exist within tissues
d
Communities exist within ecosystems which exist in the biosphere
The Diversity of Life
The fact that biology as a science has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of life on
earth The source of this diversity is evolution the process of gradual change during which new species arise
from older species Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic
world to ecosystems
A phylogenetic tree Figure 117 can summarize the evolution of various life forms on Earth It is a diagram
