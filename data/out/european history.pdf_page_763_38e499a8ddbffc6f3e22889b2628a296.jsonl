its role in world history For many on the left this was too limited Anarchists 
returned to the activist stance of the first radical socialists by launching a violent 
campaign culminating in the murder of a number of prominent European 
leaders at the end of the nineteenth century Yet they also pleaded for the 
creation of a real utopia in the present and rejected the Marxist deviation via 
the dictatorship of the proletariat and the seizure of the state before the state 
would finally wither away under communism For anarchists it was not just 
the capitalist state but the state as such that was the problemin that sense
