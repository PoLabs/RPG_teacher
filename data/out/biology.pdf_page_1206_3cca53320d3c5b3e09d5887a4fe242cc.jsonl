Osteoblasts secrete the extracellular matrix and deposit calcium which hardens the matrix The nonmineralized
portion of the bone or osteoid continues to form around blood vessels forming spongy bone Connective tissue
in the matrix differentiates into red bone marrow in the fetus The spongy bone is remodeled into a thin layer of
compact bone on the surface of the spongy bone
Endochondral Ossification
Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage All of the bones of
the body except for the flat bones of the skull mandible and clavicles are formed through endochondral
ossification
In long bones chondrocytes form a template of the hyaline cartilage diaphysis Responding to complex
developmental signals the matrix begins to calcify This calcification prevents diffusion of nutrients into the
matrix resulting in chondrocytes dying and the opening up of cavities in the diaphysis cartilage Blood vessels
invade the cavities and osteoblasts and osteoclasts modify the calcified cartilage matrix into spongy bone
Osteoclasts then break down some of the spongy bone to create a marrow or medullary cavity in the center of
the diaphysis Dense irregular connective tissue forms a sheath periosteum around the bones The periosteum
assists in attaching the bone to surrounding tissues tendons and ligaments The bone continues to grow and
elongate as the cartilage cells at the epiphyses divide
In the last stage of prenatal bone development the centers of the epiphyses begin to calcify Secondary
ossification centers form in the epiphyses as blood vessels and osteoblasts enter these areas and convert
hyaline cartilage into spongy bone Until adolescence hyaline cartilage persists at the epiphyseal plate growth
plate which is the region between the diaphysis and epiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of
long bones Figure 3821

is the connective tissue on the outside of bone that acts as the interface between bone blood vessels tendons and
ligaments
Growth of Bone
Long bones continue to lengthen potentially until adolescence through the addition of bone tissue at the
epiphyseal plate They also increase in width through appositional growth
Lengthening of Long Bones
Chondrocytes on the epiphyseal side of the epiphyseal plate divide one cell remains undifferentiated near the
epiphysis and one cell moves toward the diaphysis The cells which are pushed from the epiphysis mature
and are destroyed by calcification This process replaces cartilage with bone on the diaphyseal side of the plate
resulting in a lengthening of the bone
Long bones stop growing at around the age of 18 in females and the age of 21 in males in a process called
epiphyseal plate closure During this process cartilage cells stop dividing and all of the cartilage is replaced by
bone The epiphyseal plate fades leaving a structure called the epiphyseal line or epiphyseal remnant and the
epiphysis and diaphysis fuse
Thickening of Long Bones
Appositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bony tissue at the surface of
bones Osteoblasts at the bone surface secrete bone matrix and osteoclasts on the inner surface break down
bone The osteoblasts differentiate into osteocytes A balance between these two processes allows the bone to
