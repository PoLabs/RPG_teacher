35 PROTEST AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS
403
representative institutions urban and rural populations were forced to employ 
a range of methods to oppose unwanted policies or demand reforms They 
were sustained by often poorly articulated but stronglyheld ideas about right 
and wrong A lot of these ideas centred around some form of local selfrule 
We see such ideas in the earlysixteenthcentury Reformation movements 
and again during the French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century 
Rebellious peasants and urban citizens used local institutions to mobilise and 
organise They were helped by the fact that they were usually armed while 
the state did not have local police forces in every community States were often 
successful in suppressing rebellions but tended later to introduce reforms that 
partially satisfied the rebels demands The great changes of the early modern 
period would not have happened without the active participation of peasants 
and citizens
