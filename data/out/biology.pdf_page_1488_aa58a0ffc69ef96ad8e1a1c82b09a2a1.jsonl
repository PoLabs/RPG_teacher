understood Freeliving bacteria such as Azotobacter are also important nitrogen fixers
Organic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics since many ecosystem processes
such as primary production and decomposition are limited by the available supply of nitrogen As shown
in Figure 4617 the nitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is successively converted from
organic nitrogen back into nitrogen gas by bacteria This process occurs in three steps in terrestrial systems
ammonification nitrification and denitrification First the ammonification process converts nitrogenous waste
from living animals or from the remains of dead animals into ammonium NH4 by certain bacteria and fungi
Second the ammonium is converted to nitrites NO2 by nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrosomonas through
nitrification Subsequently nitrites are converted to nitrates NO3 by similar organisms Third the process
of denitrification occurs whereby bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium convert the nitrates into
nitrogen gas allowing it to reenter the atmosphere
Figure 4617 Nitrogen enters the living world from the atmosphere via nitrogenfixing bacteria This nitrogen and
nitrogenous waste from animals is then processed back into gaseous nitrogen by soil bacteria which also supply
terrestrial food webs with the organic nitrogen they need credit modification of work by John M Evans and

Which of the following statements about the nitrogen cycle is false
a
Ammonification converts organic nitrogenous matter from living organisms into ammonium NH4
b
Denitrification by bacteria converts nitrates NO3 to nitrogen gas N2
c
Nitrification by bacteria converts nitrates NO3 to nitrites NO2
d
Nitrogen fixing bacteria convert nitrogen gas N2 into organic compounds
Human activity can release nitrogen into the environment by two primary means the combustion of fossil fuels
which releases different nitrogen oxides and by the use of artificial fertilizers in agriculture which are then
washed into lakes streams and rivers by surface runoff Atmospheric nitrogen is associated with several effects
on Earths ecosystems including the production of acid rain as nitric acid HNO3 and greenhouse gas as
nitrous oxide N2O potentially causing climate change A major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and
