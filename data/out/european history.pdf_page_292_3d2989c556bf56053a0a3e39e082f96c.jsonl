attached to the various dress codes languages and cultural characteristics 
of different nations In the newly founded Dutch Republic literary authors 
but also the official committee providing a new translation of the Bible made 
conscious efforts to develop a Dutch language distinct from the LowGerman 
that had so far dominated in the region Likewise after the United Kingdom 
was formed in the 1707 Union the Church of England the monarchy and the 
army were instrumentalised in the creation of a British national identity
Conclusion
The history of states during the early modern period was shaped by two 
major developments In the first place states became more powerful Their 
institutions expanded they had more money to spend and more personnel 
mainly soldiers in 1800 than they did in 1500 Secondly the number of 
independent states declined as smaller units were absorbed by their neighbours 
or decided to collaborate in voluntary unions Exact numbers depend on the 
definition of what a state was but the trend was unmistakable In the process 
states became more concerned about their identity which they framed around 
the concept of nationhood These developments reached their apogee in the 
nineteenth century but were already underway during the centuries discussed 
in this chapter These processes took different shapes in different regions of 
Europe however and their pace could be equally diverse There was no single 
European path to state and nationhood
