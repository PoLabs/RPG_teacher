between the actin and myosin molecules Pi is then released allowing myosin to expend the stored energy as
a conformational change The myosin head moves toward the M line pulling the actin along with it As the actin
is pulled the filaments move approximately 10 nm toward the M line This movement is called the power stroke
as it is the step at which force is produced As the actin is pulled toward the M line the sarcomere shortens and
the muscle contracts
When the myosin head is cocked it contains energy and is in a highenergy configuration This energy is
expended as the myosin head moves through the power stroke at the end of the power stroke the myosin head
is in a lowenergy position After the power stroke ADP is released however the crossbridge formed is still in
place and actin and myosin are bound together ATP can then attach to myosin which allows the crossbridge
cycle to start again and further muscle contraction can occur Figure 3837
