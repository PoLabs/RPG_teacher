It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire
A sudden yelp told her she had done her job Scooping the fire off him
into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row 
Snape would never know what had happened
It was enough Up in the air Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on
to his broom
Neville you can look Ron said Neville had been sobbing into
Hagrids jacket for the last five minutes
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his
hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick  he hit the field
on all fours  coughed  and something gold fell into his hand
Ive got the Snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the
game ended in complete confusion
He didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it Flint was still howling
twenty minutes later but it made no difference  Harry hadnt broken
any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results 
Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty Harry
heard none of this though He was being made a cup of strong tea back
in Hagrids hut with Ron and Hermione
It was Snape Ron was explaining Hermione and I saw him He was
cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldnt take his eyes off you
Rubbish said Hagrid who hadnt heard a word of what had gone on next
to him in the stands Why would Snape do somethin like that
Harry Ron and Hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell
him Harry decided on the truth
I found out something about him he told Hagrid He tried to get past
that threeheaded dog on Halloween It bit him We think he was trying
to steal whatever its guarding
Hagrid dropped the teapot
How do you know about Fluffy he said
