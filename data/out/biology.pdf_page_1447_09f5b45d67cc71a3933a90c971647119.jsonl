Biodiversity Species Richness and Relative Species Abundance
Biodiversity describes a communitys biological complexity it is measured by the number of different species
species richness in a particular area and their relative abundance species evenness The area in question
could be a habitat a biome or the entire biosphere Species richness is the term that is used to describe the
number of species living in a habitat or biome Species richness varies across the globe Figure 4529 One
factor in determining species richness is latitude with the greatest species richness occurring in ecosystems
near the equator which often have warmer temperatures large amounts of rainfall and low seasonality The
lowest species richness occurs near the poles which are much colder drier and thus less conducive to life in
Geologic time time since glaciations The predictability of climate or productivity is also an important factor
Other factors influence species richness as well For example the study of island biogeography attempts to
explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains including the Galpagos
Islands that inspired the young Darwin Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species
relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat ecosystem or biome Foundation species
often have the highest relative abundance of species

Keystone Species
A keystone species is one whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity within an ecosystem and to
upholding an ecological communitys structure The intertidal sea star Pisaster ochraceus of the northwestern
United States is a keystone species Figure 4530 Studies have shown that when this organism is removed
from communities populations of their natural prey mussels increase completely altering the species
composition and reducing biodiversity Another keystone species is the banded tetra a fish in tropical streams
