Figure 216 Viruses can be classified according to their core genetic material and capsid design a Rabies virus
has a singlestranded RNA ssRNA core and an enveloped helical capsid whereas b variola virus the causative
agent of smallpox has a doublestranded DNA dsDNA core and a complex capsid Rabies transmission occurs
when saliva from an infected mammal enters a wound The virus travels through neurons in the peripheral nervous
system to the central nervous system where it impairs brain function and then travels to other tissues The virus can
infect any mammal and most die within weeks of infection Smallpox is a human virus transmitted by inhalation of the
variola virus localized in the skin mouth and throat which causes a characteristic rash Before its eradication in 1979
infection resulted in a 30 to 35 percent mortality rate credit rabies diagram modification of work by CDC rabies

Viruses can also be classified by the design of their capsids Table 212 and Figure 217 Capsids are classified
as naked icosahedral enveloped icosahedral enveloped helical naked helical and complex The type of
genetic material DNA or RNA and its structure single or doublestranded linear or circular and segmented or
nonsegmented are used to classify the virus core structures Table 212
