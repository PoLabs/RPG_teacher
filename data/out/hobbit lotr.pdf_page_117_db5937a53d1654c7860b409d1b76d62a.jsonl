very wide right across the way and it was black or looked it in the gloom It was
well that Beorn had warned them against it or they would have drunk from it
whatever its colour and filled some of their emptied skins at its bank As it was
they only thought of how to cross it without wetting themselves in its water
There had been a bridge of wood across but it had rotted and fallen leaving only
the broken posts near the bank
Bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering forward cried There is a boat
against the far bank Now why couldnt it have been this side
How far away do you think it is asked Thorin for by now they knew
Bilbo had the sharpest eyes among them
Not at all far I shouldnt think above twelve yards
Twelve yards I should have thought it was thirty at least but my eyes dont
see as well as they used a hundred years ago Still twelve yards is as good as a
mile We cant jump it and we darent try to wade or swim
Can any of you throw a rope
Whats the good of that The boat is sure to be tied up even if we could
hook it which I doubt
I dont believe it is tied said Bilbo though of course I cant be sure in this
light but it looks to me as if it was just drawn up on the bank which is low just
there where the path goes down into the water
Dori is the strongest but Fili is the youngest and still has the best sight
said Thorin Come here Fili and see if you can see the boat Mr Baggins is
talking about
Fili thought he could so when he had stared a long while to get an idea of the
direction the others brought him a rope They had several with them and on the
end of the longest they fastened one of the large iron hooks they had used for
catching their packs to the straps about their shoulders Fili took this in his hand
balanced it for a moment and then flung it across the stream
Splash it fell in the water Not far enough said Bilbo who was peering
forward A couple of feet and you would have dropped it on to the boat Try
again I dont suppose the magic is strong enough to hurt you if you just touch a
bit of wet rope
Fili picked up the hook when he had drawn it back rather doubtfully all the
same This time he threw it with great strength
Steady said Bilbo you have thrown it right into the wood on the other
side now Draw it back gently Fili hauled the rope back slowly and after a
while Bilbo said Carefully It is lying on the boat lets hope the hook will
