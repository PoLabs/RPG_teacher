Evolution of Angiosperms
The roughly 200 million years between the appearance of the gymnosperms and the flowering plants gives us
some appreciation for the evolutionary experimentation that ultimately produced flowers and fruit Angiosperms
seed in a vessel produce a flower containing male andor female reproductive structures Fossil evidence
Figure 266 indicates that flowering plants first appeared about 125 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous
late in the Mesozoic era and were rapidly diversifying by about 100 million years ago in the Middle Cretaceous
Earlier traces of angiosperms are scarce Fossilized pollen recovered from Jurassic geological material has been
attributed to angiosperms A few early Cretaceous rocks show clear imprints of leaves resembling angiosperm
leaves By the midCretaceous a staggering number of diverse flowering plants crowd the fossil record The
same geological period is also marked by the appearance of many modern groups of insects suggesting that
pollinating insects played a key role in the evolution of flowering plants
New data in comparative genomics and paleobotany the study of ancient plants have shed some light on
the evolution of angiosperms Although the angiosperms appeared after the gymnosperms they are probably
not derived from gymnosperm ancestors Instead the angiosperms form a sister clade a species and its
descendents that developed in parallel with the gymnosperms The two innovative structures of flowers and
fruit represent an improved reproductive strategy that served to protect the embryo while increasing genetic
variability and range There is no current consensus on the origin of the angiosperms Paleobotanists debate
whether angiosperms evolved from small woody bushes or were related to the ancestors of tropical grasses
Both views draw support from cladistics and the socalled woody magnoliid hypothesiswhich proposes
that the early ancestors of angiosperms were shrubs like modern magnoliaalso offers molecular biological
evidence
The most primitive living angiosperm is considered to be Amborella trichopoda a small plant native to the
rainforest of New Caledonia an island in the South Pacific Analysis of the genome of A trichopoda has shown
that it is related to all existing flowering plants and belongs to the oldest confirmed branch of the angiosperm
family tree The nuclear genome shows evidence of an ancient wholegenome duplication The mitochondrial
genome is large and multichromosomal containing elements from the mitochondrial genomes of several other
species including algae and a moss A few other angiosperm groups called basal angiosperms are viewed as
having ancestral traits because they branched off early from the phylogenetic tree Most modern angiosperms
