which species it is most closely related Phylogenetic relationships provide information on shared ancestry but
not necessarily on how organisms are similar or different
Phylogenetic Trees
Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among
organisms A phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or
groups of organisms Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since
one cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships In other words we can construct a tree of life to
illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms Figure
202
Unlike a taxonomic classification diagram we can read a phylogenetic tree like a map of evolutionary history
Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor Scientists call such
trees rooted which means there is a single ancestral lineage typically drawn from the bottom or left to which
all organisms represented in the diagram relate Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains
Bacteria Archaea and Eukaryadiverge from a single point and branch off The small branch that plants and
animals including humans occupy in this diagram shows how recent and miniscule these groups are compared
with other organisms Unrooted trees do not show a common ancestor but do show relationships among species
Figure 202 Both of these phylogenetic trees show the relationship of the three domains of lifeBacteria Archaea
and Eukaryabut the a rooted tree attempts to identify when various species diverged from a common ancestor
while the b unrooted tree does not credit a modification of work by Eric Gaba
In a rooted tree the branching indicates evolutionary relationships Figure 203 The point where a split occurs
a branch point represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one We call a lineage that evolved
early from the root that remains unbranched a basal taxon We call two lineages stemming from the same
branch point sister taxa A branch with more than two lineages is a polytomy and serves to illustrate where
scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships Note that although sister taxa and polytomy do
share an ancestor it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other Organisms in
two taxa may have split at a specific branch point but neither taxon gave rise to the other
Figure 203 A phylogenetic trees root indicates that an ancestral lineage gave rise to all organisms on the tree A
branch point indicates where two lineages diverged A lineage that evolved early and remains unbranched is a basal
taxon When two lineages stem from the same branch point they are sister taxa A branch with more than two lineages
is a polytomy
