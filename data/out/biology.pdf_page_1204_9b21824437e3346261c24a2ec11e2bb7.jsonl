Figure 3819 Compact bone tissue consists of osteons that are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone and
the Haversian canal that contains the bones blood vessels and nerve fibers The inner layer of bones consists
of spongy bone tissue The small dark ovals in the osteon represent the living osteocytes credit modification of
work by NCI NIH
Which of the following statements about bone tissue is false
a
Compact bone tissue is made of cylindrical osteons that are aligned such that they travel the length of
the bone
b
Haversian canals contain blood vessels only
c
Haversian canals contain blood vessels and nerve fibers
d
Spongy tissue is found on the interior of the bone and compact bone tissue is found on the exterior
Spongy Bone Tissue
Whereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the
inner layer of all bones Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue
Instead it consists of trabeculae which are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates Red bone marrow is
found between the trabuculae Blood vessels within this tissue deliver nutrients to osteocytes and remove waste
The red bone marrow of the femur and the interior of other large bones such as the ileum forms blood cells
Spongy bone reduces the density of bone and allows the ends of long bones to compress as the result of
stresses applied to the bone Spongy bone is prominent in areas of bones that are not heavily stressed or where
stresses arrive from many directions The epiphyses of bones such as the neck of the femur are subject to
stress from many directions Imagine laying a heavy framed picture flat on the floor You could hold up one side
of the picture with a toothpick if the toothpick was perpendicular to the floor and the picture Now drill a hole and
stick the toothpick into the wall to hang up the picture In this case the function of the toothpick is to transmit
the downward pressure of the picture to the wall The force on the picture is straight down to the floor but the
force on the toothpick is both the picture wire pulling down and the bottom of the hole in the wall pushing up The
toothpick will break off right at the wall
The neck of the femur is horizontal like the toothpick in the wall The weight of the body pushes it down near the
joint but the vertical diaphysis of the femur pushes it up at the other end The neck of the femur must be strong
enough to transfer the downward force of the body weight horizontally to the vertical shaft of the femur Figure
