Chapter II
ROAST MUTTON
Up jumped Bilbo and putting on his dressinggown went into the diningroom
There he saw nobody but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast There
was a fearful mess in the room and piles of unwashed crocks in the kitchen
Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used The washing
up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night
before had not been part of his bad dreams as he had rather hoped Indeed he
was really relieved after all to think that they had all gone without him and
without bothering to wake him up but with never a thankyou he thought
and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed The feeling
surprised him
Dont be a fool Bilbo Baggins he said to himself thinking of dragons
and all that outlandish nonsense at your age So he put on an apron lit fires
boiled water and washed up Then he had a nice little breakfast in the kitchen
before turning out the diningroom By that time the sun was shining and the
front door was open letting in a warm spring breeze Bilbo began to whistle
loudly and to forget about the night before In fact he was just sitting down to a
nice little second breakfast in the diningroom by the open window when in
walked Gandalf
My dear fellow said he whenever are you going to come What about an
early startand here you are having breakfast or whatever you call it at half
past ten They left you the message because they could not wait
What message said poor Mr Baggins all in a fluster
Great Elephants said Gandalf you are not at all yourself this morning
you have never dusted the mantelpiece
Whats that got to do with it I have had enough to do with washing up for
