Direct marketing Email and mobile
Custom landing pages if required should be created for any promotions being communicated 
by email For the most part marketing messages should aim to get the customer to the site 
landing pages are therefore essential They need to be optimised to close the call to action 
The message gets the subscriber onto the page and the landing page gets them to sign up 
buy or engage The idea is to create a flow between the two that brings the selling process 
full circle whether its actually buying something or just reading through the content to engage 
them with the brand 
Direct marketing and social media work very well together for crosschannel promotion Where 
email and SMS can create a oneonone feel between a brand and an individual social media 
can move that attention towards a sense of community and keep your consumer involved in 
a dialogue
