The Periodic Table
The periodic table organizes and displays different elements Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev
18341907 in 1869 the table groups elements that although unique share certain chemical properties with
other elements The properties of elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature they
may be gases solids or liquids Elements also have specific chemical reactivity the ability to combine and to
chemically bond with each other
In the periodic table in Figure 25 the elements are organized and displayed according to their atomic number
and are arranged in a series of rows and columns based on shared chemical and physical properties In addition
to providing the atomic number for each element the periodic table also displays the elements atomic mass
Looking at carbon for example its symbol C and name appear as well as its atomic number of six in the
upper lefthand corner and its atomic mass of 1211
Figure 25 The periodic table shows each elements atomic mass and atomic number The atomic number appears
above the symbol for the element and the approximate atomic mass appears below it
The periodic table groups elements according to chemical properties Scientists base the differences in chemical
reactivity between the elements on the number and spatial distribution of an atoms electrons Atoms that
chemically react and bond to each other form molecules Molecules are simply two or more atoms chemically
bonded together Logically when two atoms chemically bond to form a molecule their electrons which form the
outermost region of each atom come together first as the atoms form a chemical bond
Electron Shells and the Bohr Model
Note that there is a connection between the number of protons in an element the atomic number that
distinguishes one element from another and the number of electrons it has In all electrically neutral atoms the
number of electrons is the same as the number of protons Thus each element at least when electrically neutral
has a characteristic number of electrons equal to its atomic number
In 1913 Danish scientist Niels Bohr 18851962 developed an early model of the atom The Bohr model shows
the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific
distances from the nucleus as Figure 26 illustrates These orbits form electron shells or energy levels which
are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells These energy levels are designated by
