the polyp serves as the asexual phase while the medusa serves as the sexual stage and produces gametes
However both body forms are diploid
An example of cnidarian dimorphism can be seen in the colonial hydroid Obelia The sessile asexual colony
has two types of polyps shown in Figure 287 The first is the gastrozooid which is adapted for capturing prey
and feeding In Obelia all polyps are connected through a common digestive cavity called a coenosarc The
other type of polyp is the gonozooid adapted for the asexual budding and the production of sexual medusae
The reproductive buds from the gonozooid break off and mature into freeswimming medusae which are either
male or female dioecious Each medusa has either several testes or several ovaries in which meiosis occurs
to produce sperm or egg cells Interestingly the gameteproducing cells do not arise within the gonad itself
but migrate into it from the tissues in the gonozooid This separate origin of gonad and gametes is common
throughout the eumetazoa The gametes are released into the surrounding water and after fertilization the
zygote develops into a blastula which soon develops into a ciliated bilaterally symmetrical planula larva The
planula swims freely for a while but eventually attaches to a substrate and becomes a single polyp from which
a new colony of polyps is formed by budding
Figure 287 Obelia The colonial sessile form of Obelia geniculata has two types of polyps gastrozooids which are
adapted for capturing prey and gonozooids which asexually bud to produce medusae

All cnidarians are diploblastic and thus have two epithelial layers in the body that are derived from the
endoderm and ectoderm of the embryo The outer layer from ectoderm is called the epidermis and lines the
