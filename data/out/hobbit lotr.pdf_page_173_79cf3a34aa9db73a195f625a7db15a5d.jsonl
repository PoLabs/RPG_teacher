beginning to feel warm Is that a kind of a glow I seem to see coming right
ahead down there he thought
It was As he went forward it grew and grew till there was no doubt about it
It was a red light steadily getting redder and redder Also it was now
undoubtedly hot in the tunnel Wisps of vapour floated up and past him and he
began to sweat A sound too began to throb in his ears a sort of bubbling like
the noise of a large pot galloping on the fire mixed with a rumble as of a
gigantic tomcat purring This grew to the unmistakable gurgling noise of some
vast animal snoring in its sleep down there in the red glow in front of him
It was at this point that Bilbo stopped Going on from there was the bravest
thing he ever did The tremendous things that happened afterwards were as
nothing compared to it He fought the real battle in the tunnel alone before he
ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait At any rate after a short halt go on he
did and you can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel an opening of
much the same size and shape as the door above Through it peeps the hobbits
little head Before him lies the great bottommost cellar or dungeonhall of the
ancient dwarves right at the Mountains root It is almost dark so that its vastness
can only be dimly guessed but rising from the near side of the rocky floor there
is a great glow The glow of Smaug
There he lay a vast redgolden dragon fast asleep a thrumming came from his
jaws and nostrils and wisps of smoke but his fires were low in slumber
Beneath him under all his limbs and his huge coiled tail and about him on all
sides stretching away across the unseen floors lay countless piles of precious
things gold wrought and unwrought gems and jewels and silver redstained in
the ruddy light
Smaug lay with wings folded like an immeasurable bat turned partly on one
side so that the hobbit could see his underparts and his long pale belly crusted
with gems and fragments of gold from his long lying on his costly bed Behind
him where the walls were nearest could dimly be seen coats of mail helms and
axes swords and spears hanging and there in rows stood great jars and vessels
filled with a wealth that could not be guessed
To say that Bilbos breath was taken away is no description at all There are
no words left to express his staggerment since Men changed the language that
they learned of elves in the days when all the world was wonderful Bilbo had
heard tell and sing of dragonhoards before but the splendour the lust the glory
