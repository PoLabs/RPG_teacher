Energy Budgets Reproductive Costs and Sexual Selection in
Drosophila
Research into how animals allocate their energy resources for growth maintenance and reproduction has
used a variety of experimental animal models Some of this work has been done using the common fruit
fly Drosophila melanogaster Studies have shown that not only does reproduction have a cost as far as
how long male fruit flies live but also fruit flies that have already mated several times have limited sperm
remaining for reproduction Fruit flies maximize their last chances at reproduction by selecting optimal
mates
In a 1981 study male fruit flies were placed in enclosures with either virgin or inseminated females The
males that mated with virgin females had shorter life spans than those in contact with the same number
of inseminated females with which they were unable to mate This effect occurred regardless of how large
indicative of their age the males were Thus males that did not mate lived longer allowing them more
opportunities to find mates in the future
More recent studies performed in 2006 show how males select the female with which they will mate and
how this is affected by previous matings Figure 458

Males were allowed to select between smaller
and larger females Findings showed that larger females had greater fecundity producing twice as many
offspring per mating as the smaller females did Males that had previously mated and thus had lower
supplies of sperm were termed resourcedepleted while males that had not mated were termed non
resourcedepleted The study showed that although nonresourcedepleted males preferentially mated with
larger females this selection of partners was more pronounced in the resourcedepleted males Thus
males with depleted sperm supplies which were limited in the number of times that they could mate before
they replenished their sperm supply selected larger more fecund females thus maximizing their chances
for offspring This study was one of the first to show that the physiological state of the male affected its
mating behavior in a way that clearly maximizes its use of limited reproductive resources
Figure 458 Male fruit flies that had previously mated spermdepleted picked larger more fecund females more
often than those that had not mated nonspermdepleted This change in behavior causes an increase in the
efficiency of a limited reproductive resource sperm
These studies demonstrate two ways in which the energy budget is a factor in reproduction First energy
expended on mating may reduce an animals lifespan but by this time they have already reproduced so
in the context of natural selection this early death is not of much evolutionary importance Second when
resources such as sperm and the energy needed to replenish it are low an organisms behavior can
change to give them the best chance of passing their genes on to the next generation These changes in
behavior so important to evolution are studied in a discipline known as behavioral biology or ethology at
the interface between population biology and psychology
