CHAPTER SUMMARY
431 Reproduction Methods
Reproduction may be asexual when one individual produces genetically identical offspring or sexual when the
genetic material from two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring Asexual
reproduction occurs through fission budding and fragmentation Sexual reproduction may mean the joining of
sperm and eggs within animals bodies or it may mean the release of sperm and eggs into the environment An
individual may be one sex or both it may start out as one sex and switch during its life or it may stay male or
female
432 Fertilization
Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization This can
occur either outside the bodies or inside the female Both methods have advantages and disadvantages Once
fertilized the eggs can develop inside the female or outside If the egg develops outside the body it usually has
a protective covering over it Animal anatomy evolved various ways to fertilize hold or expel the egg The
method of fertilization varies among animals Some species release the egg and sperm into the environment
some species retain the egg and receive the sperm into the female body and then expel the developing embryo
covered with shell while still other species retain the developing offspring through the gestation period
433 Human Reproductive Anatomy and Gametogenesis
As animals became more complex specific organs and organ systems developed to support specific functions
for the organism The reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate
fertilize internally and support the growth and development of offspring Processes developed to produce
reproductive cells that had exactly half the number of chromosomes of each parent so that new combinations
would have the appropriate amount of genetic material Gametogenesis the production of sperm
spermatogenesis and eggs oogenesis takes place through the process of meiosis
434 Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction
The male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by hormones released from the hypothalamus and
anterior pituitary as well as hormones from reproductive tissues and organs The hypothalamus monitors the
need for the FSH and LH hormones made and released from the anterior pituitary FSH and LH affect
reproductive structures to cause the formation of sperm and the preparation of eggs for release and possible
fertilization In the male FSH and LH stimulate Sertoli cells and interstitial cells of Leydig in the testes to
facilitate sperm production The Leydig cells produce testosterone which also is responsible for the secondary
sexual characteristics of males In females FSH and LH cause estrogen and progesterone to be produced
They regulate the female reproductive system which is divided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle
Menopause occurs when the ovaries lose their sensitivity to FSH and LH and the female reproductive cycles
slow to a stop
435 Human Pregnancy and Birth
Human pregnancy begins with fertilization of an egg and proceeds through the three trimesters of gestation
The labor process has three stages contractions delivery of the fetus expulsion of the placenta each
