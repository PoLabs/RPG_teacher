CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
21 What is the overall outcome of the light reactions
in photosynthesis
22 Why are carnivores such as lions dependent on
photosynthesis to survive
23 Why are energy carriers thought of as either full
or empty
24 Describe how the grey wolf population would be
impacted by a volcanic eruption that spewed a dense
ash cloud that blocked sunlight in a section of
Yellowstone National Park
25 How does the closing of the stomata limit
photosynthesis
26 Describe the pathway of electron transfer from
photosystem II to photosystem I in lightdependent
reactions
27 What are the roles of ATP and NADPH in
photosynthesis
28 How and why would the end products of
photosynthesis be changed if a plant had a mutation
that eliminated its photosystem II complex
29 Why is the third stage of the Calvin cycle called
the regeneration stage
30 Which part of the lightindependent reactions
would be affected if a cell could not produce the
enzyme RuBisCO
31 Why does it take three turns of the Calvin cycle to
produce G3P the initial product of photosynthesis
32 Imagine a sealed terrarium containing a plant and
a beetle How does each organism provide resources
for the other Could each organism survive if it was
