CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
25 In your everyday life you have probably noticed
that certain instruments are ideal for certain
situations For example you would use a spoon
rather than a fork to eat soup because a spoon is
shaped for scooping while soup would slip between
the tines of a fork The use of ideal instruments also
applies in science In what situations would the use
of a light microscope be ideal and why
26 In what situations would the use of a scanning
electron microscope be ideal and why
27 In what situations would a transmission electron
microscope be ideal and why
28 What are the advantages and disadvantages of
each of these types of microscopes
29 Explain how the formation of an adult human
follows the cell theory
30 Antibiotics are medicines that are used to fight
bacterial infections These medicines kill prokaryotic
cells without harming human cells What part or parts
