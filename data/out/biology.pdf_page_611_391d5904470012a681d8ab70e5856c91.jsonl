Figure 2215 Bacterial and archaeal phospholipids Archaeal phospholipids differ from those found in Bacteria and
Eukarya in two ways First they have branched phytanyl sidechains instead of linear ones Second an ether bond
instead of an ester bond connects the lipid to the glycerol
The Cell Wall of Prokaryotes
The cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells has a high concentration of dissolved solutes Therefore the osmotic
pressure within the cell is relatively high The cell wall is a protective layer that surrounds some cells and gives
them shape and rigidity It is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis bursting due to
increasing volume The chemical composition of the cell wall varies between Archaea and Bacteria and also
varies between bacterial species
Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan composed of polysaccharide chains that are crosslinked by unusual
peptides containing both L and Damino acids including Dglutamic acid and Dalanine Proteins normally
have only Lamino acids as a consequence many of our antibiotics work by mimicking Damino acids and
therefore have specific effects on bacterial cellwall development There are more than 100 different forms of
peptidoglycan Slayer surface layer proteins are also present on the outside of cell walls of both Archaea and
Bacteria
Bacteria are divided into two major groups Gram positive and Gram negative based on their reaction to Gram
staining Note that all Grampositive bacteria belong to one phylum bacteria in the other phyla Proteobacteria
Chlamydias Spirochetes Cyanobacteria and others are Gramnegative The Gram staining method is named
after its inventor Danish scientist Hans Christian Gram 18531938 The different bacterial responses to the
staining procedure are ultimately due to cell wall structure Grampositive organisms typically lack the outer
membrane found in Gramnegative organisms Figure 2216 Up to 90 percent of the cellwall in Grampositive
bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan and most of the rest is composed of acidic substances called teichoic
acids Teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane to form lipoteichoic acids
Lipoteichoic acids anchor the cell wall to the cell membrane Gramnegative bacteria have a relatively thin cell
wall composed of a few layers of peptidoglycan only 10 percent of the total cell wall surrounded by an outer
envelope containing lipopolysaccharides LPS and lipoproteins This outer envelope is sometimes referred to
as a second lipid bilayer The chemistry of this outer envelope is very different however from that of the typical
lipid bilayer that forms plasma membranes
