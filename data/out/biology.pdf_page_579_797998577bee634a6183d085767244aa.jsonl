able to infect adjacent cells and repeat the replication cycle As youve learned some viruses are released when
the host cell dies and other viruses can leave infected cells by budding through the membrane without directly
killing the cell
Figure 218 The influenza reproductive cycle In influenza virus infection glycoproteins on the capsid attach to a
host epithelial cell Following this the virus is engulfed RNA and proteins are then made and assembled into new
virions
Influenza virus is packaged in a viral envelope that fuses with the plasma membrane This way the virus
can exit the host cell without killing it What advantage does the virus gain by keeping the host cell alive

Different Hosts and Their Viruses
As youve learned viruses often infect very specific hosts as well as specific cells within the host This feature
of a virus makes it specific to one or a few species of life on Earth On the other hand so many different types of
viruses exist on Earth that nearly every living organism has its own set of viruses trying to infect its cells Even
prokaryotes the smallest and simplest of cells may be attacked by specific types of viruses In the following
section we will look at some of the features of viral infection of prokaryotic cells As we have learned viruses
that infect bacteria are called bacteriophages Figure 219 Archaea have their own similar viruses
