group occupies the glycerol backbones third carbon Figure 319 A phosphate group alone attached to a
diaglycerol does not qualify as a phospholipid It is phosphatidate diacylglycerol 3phosphate the precursor of
phospholipids An alcohol modifies the phosphate group Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine are two
important phospholipids that are in plasma membranes
Figure 319 A phospholipid is a molecule with two fatty acids and a modified phosphate group attached to a glycerol
backbone Adding a charged or polar chemical group may modify the phosphate
A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule meaning it has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part The fatty acid
chains are hydrophobic and cannot interact with water whereas the phosphatecontaining group is hydrophilic
and interacts with water Figure 320
Figure 320 The phospholipid bilayer is the major component of all cellular membranes The hydrophilic head groups
of the phospholipids face the aqueous solution The hydrophobic tails are sequestered in the middle of the bilayer
The head is the hydrophilic part and the tail contains the hydrophobic fatty acids In a membrane a bilayer of
phospholipids forms the structures matrix phospholipids fatty acid tails face inside away from water whereas
the phosphate group faces the outside aqueous side Figure 320
Phospholipids are responsible for the plasma membranes dynamic nature If a drop of phospholipids is placed
in water it spontaneously forms a structure that scientists call a micelle where the hydrophilic phosphate heads
face the outside and the fatty acids face the structures interior
Steroids
Unlike the phospholipids and fats that we discussed earlier steroids have a fused ring structure Although
they do not resemble the other lipids scientists group them with them because they are also hydrophobic and
