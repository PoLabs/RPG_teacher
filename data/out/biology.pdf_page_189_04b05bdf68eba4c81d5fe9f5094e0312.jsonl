Free Energy
After learning that chemical reactions release energy when energystoring bonds break an important next
question is how do we quantify and express the chemical reactions with the associated energy How can we
compare the energy that releases from one reaction to that of another reaction We use a measurement of free
energy to quantitate these energy transfers Scientists call this free energy Gibbs free energy abbreviated with
the letter G after Josiah Willard Gibbs the scientist who developed the measurement Recall that according to
the second law of thermodynamics all energy transfers involve losing some energy in an unusable form such
as heat resulting in entropy Gibbs free energy specifically refers to the energy that takes place with a chemical
reaction that is available after we account for entropy In other words Gibbs free energy is usable energy or
energy that is available to do work
Every chemical reaction involves a change in free energy called delta G G We can calculate the change
in free energy for any system that undergoes such a change such as a chemical reaction To calculate G
subtract the amount of energy lost to entropy denoted as S from the systems total energy change Scientists
call this total energy change in the system enthalpy and we denote it as H The formula for calculating G is
as follows where the symbol T refers to absolute temperature in Kelvin degrees Celsius  273
G  H TS
We express a chemical reactions standard free energy change as an amount of energy per mole of the reaction
product either in kilojoules or kilocalories kJmol or kcalmol 1 kJ  0239 kcal under standard pH temperature
and pressure conditions We generally calculate standard pH temperature and pressure conditions at pH 70
in biological systems 25 degrees Celsius and 100 kilopascals 1 atm pressure respectively Note that cellular
conditions vary considerably from these standard conditions and so standard calculated G values for biological
reactions will be different inside the cell
Endergonic Reactions and Exergonic Reactions
If energy releases during a chemical reaction then the resulting value from the above equation will be a
negative number In other words reactions that release energy have a G  0 A negative G also means
that the reactions products have less free energy than the reactants because they gave off some free energy
during the reaction Scientists call reactions that have a negative G and consequently release free energy
exergonic reactions Think exergonic means energy is exiting the system We also refer to these reactions as
spontaneous reactions because they can occur without adding energy into the system Understanding which
chemical reactions are spontaneous and release free energy is extremely useful for biologists because these
reactions can be harnessed to perform work inside the cell We must draw an important distinction between the
term spontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction that occurs immediately Contrary to the everyday use
of the term a spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs Rusting iron is an example of a
spontaneous reaction that occurs slowly little by little over time
If a chemical reaction requires an energy input rather than releasing energy then the G for that reaction will be
a positive value In this case the products have more free energy than the reactants Thus we can think of the
reactions products as energystoring molecules We call these chemical reactions endergonic reactions and
they are nonspontaneous An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without adding free energy
Lets revisit the example of the synthesis and breakdown of the food molecule glucose Remember that building
complex molecules such as sugars from simpler ones is an anabolic process and requires energy Therefore
the chemical reactions involved in anabolic processes are endergonic reactions Alternatively the catabolic
process of breaking sugar down into simpler molecules releases energy in a series of exergonic reactions Like
the rust example above the sugar breakdown involves spontaneous reactions but these reactions do not occur
instantaneously Figure 68 shows some other examples of endergonic and exergonic reactions Later sections
