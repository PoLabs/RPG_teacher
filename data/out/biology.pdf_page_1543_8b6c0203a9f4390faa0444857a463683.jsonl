receptor is repressed Lactose a sugar found in milk is not always available It makes no sense to make the
enzymes necessary to digest an energy source that is not available so the lac operon is only turned on when
lactose is present 3 Figure 1613 Protein synthesis would be inhibited 4 D 6 D

DNA is confined within the nuclear region Because of this transcription and translation are physically separated
This creates a more complex mechanism for the control of gene expression that benefits multicellular organisms
because it compartmentalizes gene regulation Gene expression occurs at many stages in eukaryotic cells whereas
in prokaryotic cells control of gene expression only occurs at the transcriptional level This allows for greater control
of gene expression in eukaryotes and more complex systems to be developed Because of this different cell types
can arise in an individual organism 25 Environmental stimuli can increase or induce transcription in prokaryotic
cells In this example lactose in the environment will induce the transcription of the lac operon but only if glucose
is not available in the environment 27 You can create medications that reverse the epigenetic processes to add
histone acetylation marks or to remove DNA methylation and create an open chromosomal configuration 29 Histone
acetylation reduces the positive charge of histone proteins loosening the DNA wrapped around the histones This
looser DNA can then interact with transcription factors to express genes found in that region Normally once the
gene is no longer needed histone deacetylase enzymes remove the acetyl groups from histones so that the DNA
becomes tightly wound and inaccessible again However when there is a defect in HDAC9 the deacetylation may
not occur In an immune cell this would mean that inflammatory genes that were made accessible during an infection
are not tightly rewound around the histones
31 If too much of an activating transcription factor were present then
transcription would be increased in the cell This could lead to dramatic alterations in cell function 33 RNA binding
proteins RBP bind to the RNA and can either increase or decrease the stability of the RNA If they increase the
stability of the RNA molecule the RNA will remain intact in the cell for a longer period of time than normal Since both
RBPs and miRNAs bind to the RNA molecule RBP can potentially bind first to the RNA and prevent the binding of
the miRNA that will degrade it 35 Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation phosphorylation
of a protein depending on the protein that is modified can alter accessibility to the chromosome can alter translation
by altering the transcription factor binding or function can change nuclear shuttling by influencing modifications to
the nuclear pore complex can alter RNA stability by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability can
modify translation increase or decrease or can change posttranslational modifications add or remove phosphates
or other chemical modifications 37 Environmental stimuli like ultraviolet light exposure can alter the modifications to
the histone proteins or DNA Such stimuli may change an actively transcribed gene into a silenced gene by removing
acetyl groups from histone proteins or by adding methyl groups to DNA 39 These drugs will keep the histone proteins
and the DNA methylation patterns in the open chromosomal configuration so that transcription is feasible If a gene is
silenced these drugs could reverse the epigenetic configuration to reexpress the gene

answers to these questions While it is true that prostate cancer treatment itself can be harmful many men would rather
be aware that they have cancer so they can monitor the disease and begin treatment if it progresses And while genetic
screening may be useful it is expensive and may cause needless worry People with certain risk factors may never
develop the disease and preventative treatments may do more harm than good 4 B 6 B 8 D 10 B 12 A 14 A 16

an agarose gel onto a nylon membrane The DNA fragments that are on the nylon membrane can be denatured to
make them singlestranded and then probed with small DNA fragments that are radioactively or fluorescently labeled
to detect the presence of specific sequences An example of the use of Southern blotting would be in analyzing
the presence absence or variation of a disease gene in genomic DNA from a group of patients 24 By identifying
an herbicide resistance gene and cloning it into a plant expression vector system like the Ti plasmid system from
Agrobacterium tumefaciens The scientist would then introduce it into the plant cells by transformation and select
cells that have taken up and integrated the herbicideresistance gene into the genome 26 Genome mapping has
many different applications and provides comprehensive information that can be used for predictive purposes 28
Metagenomics is revolutionary because it replaced the practice of using pure cultures Pure cultures were used
to study individual species in the laboratory but did not accurately represent what happens in the environment
Metagenomics studies the genomes of bacterial populations in their environmental niche 30 Proteomics has provided
a way to detect biomarkers and protein signatures which have been used to screen for the early detection of cancer

the resources of the area including competing with other individuals for those resources will produce more seeds
themselves and those traits that allowed them to better use the resources will increase in the population of the next
generation 19 In science a theory is a thoroughly tested and verified set of explanations for a body of observations of
nature It is the strongest form of knowledge in science In contrast a theory in common vernacular can mean a guess
