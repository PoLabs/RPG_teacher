Energy Requirements Related to Levels of Activity
The more active an animal is the more energy is needed to maintain that activity and the higher its BMR
or SMR The average daily rate of energy consumption is about two to four times an animals BMR or SMR
Humans are more sedentary than most animals and have an average daily rate of only 15 times the BMR The
diet of an endothermic animal is determined by its BMR For example the type of grasses leaves or shrubs that
an herbivore eats affects the number of calories that it takes in The relative caloric content of herbivore foods
in descending order is tall grasses  legumes  short grasses  forbs any broadleaved plant not a grass 
subshrubs  annualsbiennials
Energy Requirements Related to Environment
Animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor Torpor is a process that leads to
a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions Torpor can be used
by animals for long periods such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months in which case
it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature During hibernation ground squirrels can achieve an
abdominal temperature of 0 C 32 F while a bears internal temperature is maintained higher at about 37 C
99 F
If torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water it is called estivation Some
desert animals use this to survive the harshest months of the year Torpor can occur on a daily basis this is
seen in bats and hummingbirds While endothermy is limited in smaller animals by surface to volume ratio some
organisms can be smaller and still be endotherms because they employ daily torpor during the part of the day
that is coldest This allows them to conserve energy during the colder parts of the day when they consume more
energy to maintain their body temperature
Animal Body Planes and Cavities
A standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes A sagittal plane divides the body into right
and left portions A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle making two equal right and left
halves A frontal plane also called a coronal plane separates the front from the back A transverse plane or
horizontal plane divides the animal into upper and lower portions This is sometimes called a cross section and
if the transverse cut is at an angle it is called an oblique plane Figure 335 illustrates these planes on a goat a
fourlegged animal and a human being
