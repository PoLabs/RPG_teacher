Figure 224 We call molecules that have the same number and type of atoms arranged differently isomers
a Structural isomers have a different covalent arrangement of atoms b Geometric isomers have a different
arrangement of atoms around a double bond c Enantiomers are mirror images of each other
Which of the following statements is false
a
Molecules with the formulas CH3CH2COOH and C3H6O2 could be structural isomers
b
Molecules must have a double bond to be cistrans isomers
c
To be enantiomers a molecule must have at least three different atoms or groups connected to a
central carbon
d
To be enantiomers a molecule must have at least four different atoms or groups connected to a central
carbon
In triglycerides fats and oils long carbon chains known as fatty acids may contain double bonds which can be
in either the cis or trans configuration as Figure 225 illustrates Fats with at least one double bond between
carbon atoms are unsaturated fats When some of these bonds are in the cis configuration the resulting bend in
the chains carbon backbone means that triglyceride molecules cannot pack tightly so they remain liquid oil at
room temperature Alternatively triglycerides with trans double bonds popularly called trans fats have relatively
