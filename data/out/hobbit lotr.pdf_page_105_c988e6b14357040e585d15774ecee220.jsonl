torches and the fire flickered about them and on the table were two tall red
beeswax candles All the time they ate Beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales
of the wild lands on this side of the mountains and especially of the dark and
dangerous wood that lay outstretched far to North and South a days ride before
them barring their way to the East the terrible forest of Mirkwood
The dwarves listened and shook their beards for they knew that they must
soon venture into that forest and that after the mountains it was the worst of the
perils they had to pass before they came to the dragons stronghold When dinner
was over they began to tell tales of their own but Beorn seemed to be growing
drowsy and paid little heed to them They spoke most of gold and silver and
jewels and the making of things by smithcraft and Beorn did not appear to care
for such things there were no things of gold or silver in his hall and few save
the knives were made of metal at all
They sat long at the table with their wooden drinkingbowls filled with mead
The dark night came on outside The fires in the middle of the hall were built
with fresh logs and the torches were put out and still they sat in the light of the
dancing flames with the pillars of the house standing tall behind them and dark
at the top like trees of the forest Whether it was magic or not it seemed to Bilbo
that he heard a sound like wind in the branches stirring in the rafters and the
hoot of owls Soon he began to nod with sleep and the voices seemed to grow far
away until he woke with a start
The great door had creaked and slammed Beorn was gone The dwarves
were sitting crosslegged on the floor round the fire and presently they began to
sing Some of the verses were like this but there were many more and their
singing went on for a long while
The wind was on the withered heath
but in the forest stirred no leaf
there shadows lay by night and day
and dark things silent crept beneath
The wind came down from mountains cold
and like a tide it roared and rolled
the branches groaned the forest moaned
and leaves were laid upon the mould
