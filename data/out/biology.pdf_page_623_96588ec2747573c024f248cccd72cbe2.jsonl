that 76 million people get sick more than 300000 are hospitalized and 5000 Americans die each year from
foodborne illness
The characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time In the past it was relatively common to
hear about sporadic cases of botulism the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic
bacterium Clostridium botulinum Some of the most common sources for this bacterium were nonacidic canned
foods homemade pickles and processed meat and sausages The can jar or package created a suitable
anaerobic environment where Clostridium could grow Proper sterilization and canning procedures have reduced
the incidence of this disease
While people may tend to think of foodborne illnesses as associated with animalbased foods most cases are
now linked to produce There have been serious producerelated outbreaks associated with raw spinach in
the United States and with vegetable sprouts in Germany and these types of outbreaks have become more
common The raw spinach outbreak in 2006 was produced by the bacterium E coli serotype O157H7 A
serotype is a strain of bacteria that carries a set of similar antigens on its cell surface and there are often many
different serotypes of a bacterial species Most E coli are not particularly dangerous to humans but serotype
O157H7 can cause bloody diarrhea and is potentially fatal
All types of food can potentially be contaminated with bacteria Recent outbreaks of Salmonella reported by the
CDC occurred in foods as diverse as peanut butter alfalfa sprouts and eggs A deadly outbreak in Germany
in 2010 was caused by E coli contamination of vegetable sprouts Figure 2224 The strain that caused the
outbreak was found to be a new serotype not previously involved in other outbreaks which indicates that E coli
is continuously evolving Outbreaks of listeriosis due to contamination of meats raw cheeses and frozen or
fresh vegetables with Listeria monocytogenes are becoming more frequent
Figure 2224 Foodborne pathogens a Vegetable sprouts grown at an organic farm were the cause of an b E
coli outbreak that killed 32 people and sickened 3800 in Germany in 2011 The strain responsible E coli O104H4
produces Shiga toxin a substance that inhibits protein synthesis in the host cell The toxin c destroys red blood cells
resulting in bloody diarrhea Deformed red blood cells clog the capillaries of the kidney which can lead to kidney failure
as happened to 845 patients in the 2011 outbreak Kidney failure is usually reversible but some patients experience
kidney problems years later credit c NIDDK NIH
Biofilms and Disease
Recall that biofilms are microbial communities that are very difficult to destroy They are responsible for
diseases such as Legionnaires disease otitis media ear infections and various infections in patients with
cystic fibrosis They produce dental plaque and colonize catheters prostheses transcutaneous and orthopedic
devices contact lenses and internal devices such as pacemakers They also form in open wounds and burned
tissue In healthcare environments biofilms grow on hemodialysis machines mechanical ventilators shunts
and other medical equipment In fact 65 percent of all infections acquired in the hospital nosocomial infections
are attributed to biofilms Biofilms are also related to diseases contracted from food because they colonize the
surfaces of vegetable leaves and meat as well as foodprocessing equipment that isnt adequately cleaned
Biofilm infections develop gradually and may not cause immediate symptoms They are rarely resolved by host
defense mechanisms Once an infection by a biofilm is established it is very difficult to eradicate because
biofilms tend to be resistant to most methods used to control microbial growth including antibiotics The matrix
that attaches the cells to a substrate and to other another protects the cells from antibiotics or drugs In addition
since biofilms grow slowly they are less responsive to agents that interfere with cell growth It has been reported
that biofilms can resist up to 1000 times the antibiotic concentrations used to kill the same bacteria when they
are freeliving or planktonic An antibiotic dose that large would harm the patient therefore scientists are working
on new ways to get rid of biofilms
