happens with asthma or emphysema the airways become obstructed trapping air in the lungs and causing
breathing to become difficult Alterations in the ventilation of the airways or perfusion of the arteries can affect
gas exchange These changes in ventilation and perfusion called VQ mismatch can arise from anatomical or
physiological changes
394 Transport of Gases in Human Bodily Fluids
Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that is comprised of two alpha and two beta subunits that
surround an ironcontaining heme group Oxygen readily binds this heme group The ability of oxygen to bind
increases as more oxygen molecules are bound to heme Disease states and altered conditions in the body
can affect the binding ability of oxygen and increase or decrease its ability to dissociate from hemoglobin
Carbon dioxide can be transported through the blood via three methods It is dissolved directly in the blood
bound to plasma proteins or hemoglobin or converted into bicarbonate The majority of carbon dioxide is
transported as part of the bicarbonate system Carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells Inside carbonic
anhydrase converts carbon dioxide into carbonic acid H2CO3 which is subsequently hydrolyzed into
bicarbonate HCO3
 and H The H ion binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells and bicarbonate is
transported out of the red blood cells in exchange for a chloride ion This is called the chloride shift
Bicarbonate leaves the red blood cells and enters the blood plasma In the lungs bicarbonate is transported
back into the red blood cells in exchange for chloride The H dissociates from hemoglobin and combines with
bicarbonate to form carbonic acid with the help of carbonic anhydrase which further catalyzes the reaction to
convert carbonic acid back into carbon dioxide and water The carbon dioxide is then expelled from the lungs
VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS

c
Alveolar ducts connect to alveolar sacs
d
Gas exchange between the lung and blood
takes place in the alveolus
2 Figure 3913 Which of the following statements is
false
a
In the tissues PO2 drops as blood passes
from the arteries to the veins while PCO2
increases
b
Blood travels from the lungs to the heart to
body tissues then back to the heart then

Blood travels from the lungs to the heart to
body tissues then back to the lungs then
the heart
d
PO2 is higher in air than in the lungs
3 Figure 3920 The kidneys are responsible for
removing excess H ions from the blood If the
kidneys fail what would happen to blood pH and to
hemoglobin affinity for oxygen
