261  Evolution of Seed Plants
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the two major innovations that allowed seed plants to reproduce in the absence of water

Explain when seed plants first appeared and when gymnosperms became the dominant plant group

Discuss the purpose of pollen grains and seeds

Describe the significance of angiosperms bearing both flowers and fruit
The first plants to colonize land were most likely related to the ancestors of modern day mosses bryophytes
which are thought to have appeared about 500 million years ago They were followed by liverworts also
bryophytes and primitive vascular plantsthe pterophytesfrom which modern ferns are descended The life
cycle of bryophytes and pterophytes is characterized by the alternation of generations which is also exhibited in
the gymnosperms and angiosperms However what sets bryophytes and pterophytes apart from gymnosperms
and angiosperms is their reproductive requirement for water The completion of the bryophyte and pterophyte
life cycle requires water because the male gametophyte releases flagellated sperm which must swim to reach
and fertilize the female gamete or egg After fertilization the zygote undergoes cellular division and grows into a
diploid sporophyte which in turn will form sporangia or spore vessels In the sporangia mother cells undergo
meiosis and produce the haploid spores Release of spores in a suitable environment will lead to germination
and a new generation of gametophytes
In seed plants the evolutionary trend led to a dominant sporophyte generation accompanied by a corresponding
reduction in the size of the gametophyte from a conspicuous structure to a microscopic cluster of cells enclosed
in the tissues of the sporophyte Whereas lower vascular plants such as club mosses and ferns are mostly
homosporous producing only one type of spore all seed plants or spermatophytes are heterosporous
producing two types of spores megaspores female and microspores male Megaspores develop into female
gametophytes that produce eggs and microspores mature into male gametophytes that generate sperm
Because the gametophytes mature within the spores they are not freeliving as are the gametophytes of other
seedless vascular plants
Ancestral heterosporous seedless plants represented by modernday plants such as the spike moss
Selaginella are seen as the evolutionary forerunners of seed plants In the life cycle of Selaginella both
male and female sporangia develop within the same stemlike strobilus In each male sporangium multiple
microspores are produced by meiosis Each microspore produces a small antheridium contained within a spore
case As it develops it is released from the strobilus and a number of flagellated sperm are produced that
then leave the spore case In the female sporangium a single megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis to
produce four megaspores Gametophytes develop within each megaspore consisting of a mass of tissue that
will later nourish the embryo and a few archegonia The female gametophyte may remain within remnants of
the spore wall in the megasporangium until after fertilization has occurred and the embryo begins to develop
This combination of an embryo and nutritional cells is a little different from the organization of a seed since the
nutritive endosperm in a seed is formed from a single cell rather than multiple cells
Both seeds and pollen distinguish seed plants from seedless vascular plants These innovative structures
allowed seed plants to reduce or eliminate their dependence on water for gamete fertilization and development of
the embryo and to conquer dry land Pollen grains are male gametophytes which contain the sperm gametes
of the plant The small haploid 1n cells are encased in a protective coat that prevents desiccation drying
out and mechanical damage Pollen grains can travel far from their original sporophyte spreading the plants
genes Seeds offer the embryo protection nourishment and a mechanism to maintain dormancy for tens or even
thousands of years ensuring that germination can occur when growth conditions are optimal Seeds therefore
allow plants to disperse the next generation through both space and time With such evolutionary advantages
seed plants have become the most successful and familiar group of plants
Both adaptations expanded the colonization of land begun by the bryophytes and their ancestors Fossils
place the earliest distinct seed plants at about 350 million years ago The first reliable record of gymnosperms
dates their appearance to the Pennsylvanian period about 319 million years ago Figure 262 Gymnosperms
were preceded by progymnosperms the first naked seed plants which arose about 380 million years ago
Progymnosperms were a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers cone bearers
