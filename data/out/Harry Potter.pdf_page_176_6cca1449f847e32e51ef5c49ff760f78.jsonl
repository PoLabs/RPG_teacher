legendary substance with astonishing powers The stone will transform
any metal into pure gold It also produces the Elixir of Life which
will make the drinker immortal
There have been many reports of the Sorcerers Stone over the centuries
but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr Nicolas Flamel
the noted alchemist and opera lover Mr Flamel who celebrated his six
hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in Devon
with his wife Perenelle six hundred and fiftyeight
See said Hermione when Harry and Ron had finished The dog must be
guarding Flamels Sorcerers Stone I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it
safe for him because theyre friends and he knew someone was after it
thats why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts
A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said Harry No
wonder Snapes after it Anyone would want it
And no wonder we couldnt find Flamel in that Study of Recent
Developments in Wizardry said Ron Hes not exactly recent if hes
six hundred and sixtyfive is he
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts while copying down
different ways of treating werewolf bites Harry and Ron were still
discussing what theyd do with a Sorcerers Stone if they had one It
wasnt until Ron said hed buy his own Quidditch team that Harry
remembered about Snape and the coming match
Im going to play he told Ron and Hermione If I dont all the
Slytherins will think Im just too scared to face Snape Ill show
them itll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win
Just as long as were not wiping you off the field said Hermione
As the match drew nearer however Harry became more and more nervous
whatever he told Ron and Hermione The rest of the team wasnt too calm
either The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was
wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed
to with such a biased referee
Harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to
keep running into Snape wherever he went At times he even wondered
whether Snape was following him trying to catch him on his own Potions
