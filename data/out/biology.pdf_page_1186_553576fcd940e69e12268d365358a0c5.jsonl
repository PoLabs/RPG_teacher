parafollicular cells of the thyroid produce calcitonin which reduces blood Ca2 levels Growth hormone GH is
produced by the anterior pituitary and controls the growth rate of muscle and bone GH action is indirectly
mediated by insulinlike growth factors IGFs Shortterm stress causes the hypothalamus to trigger the
adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and norepinephrine which trigger the fight or flight response Long
term stress causes the hypothalamus to trigger the anterior pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone
ACTH which causes the release of corticosteroids glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids from the adrenal
cortex
374 Regulation of Hormone Production
Hormone levels are primarily controlled through negative feedback in which rising levels of a hormone inhibit
its further release The three mechanisms of hormonal release are humoral stimuli hormonal stimuli and
neural stimuli Humoral stimuli refers to the control of hormonal release in response to changes in extracellular
fluid levels or ion levels Hormonal stimuli refers to the release of hormones in response to hormones released
by other endocrine glands Neural stimuli refers to the release of hormones in response to neural stimulation
375 Endocrine Glands
The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain and is attached to the hypothalamus by the infundibulum
The anterior pituitary receives products from the hypothalamus by the hypophyseal portal system and produces
six hormones The posterior pituitary is an extension of the brain and releases hormones antidiuretic hormone
and oxytocin produced by the hypothalamus
The thyroid gland is located in the neck and is composed of two lobes connected by the isthmus The thyroid is
made up of follicle cells that produce the hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine Parafollicular cells of the
thyroid produce calcitonin The parathyroid glands lie on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland and produce
parathyroid hormone
The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and consist of the renal cortex and renal medulla The
adrenal cortex is the outer part of the adrenal gland and produces the corticosteroids glucocorticoids and
mineralocorticoids The adrenal medulla is the inner part of the adrenal gland and produces the catecholamines
epinephrine and norepinephrine
The pancreas lies in the abdomen between the stomach and the small intestine Clusters of endocrine cells in
the pancreas form the islets of Langerhans which are composed of alpha cells that release glucagon and beta
cells that release insulin
Some organs possess endocrine activity as a secondary function but have another primary function The heart
produces the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide which functions to reduce blood volume pressure and Na
concentration The gastrointestinal tract produces various hormones that aid in digestion The kidneys produce
renin calcitriol and erythropoietin Adipose tissue produces leptin which promotes satiety signals in the brain
VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS
1 Figure 375 Heat shock proteins HSP are so
named because they help refold misfolded proteins
In response to increased temperature a heat
shock heat shock proteins are activated by release
from the NRHSP complex At the same time
transcription of HSP genes is activated Why do you
think the cell responds to a heat shock by increasing
the activity of proteins that help refold misfolded
proteins
2 Figure 3711 Pancreatic tumors may cause
excess secretion of glucagon Type I diabetes results
from the failure of the pancreas to produce insulin
Which of the following statement about these two
conditions is true
a
A pancreatic tumor and type I diabetes will
have the opposite effects on blood sugar
levels
b
A pancreatic tumor and type I diabetes will
both cause hyperglycemia
c
A pancreatic tumor and type I diabetes will
both cause hypoglycemia
d
Both pancreatic tumors and type I diabetes
result in the inability of cells to take up
glucose
3 Figure 3714 Hyperthyroidism is a condition in
which the thyroid gland is overactive Hypothyroidism
is a condition in which the thyroid gland is
underactive Which of the conditions are the following
two patients most likely to have
Patient A has symptoms including weight gain cold
