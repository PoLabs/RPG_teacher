Earth appearing 35 to 38 billion years ago These organisms are abundant and ubiquitous that is they are
present everywhere In addition to inhabiting moderate environments they are found in extreme conditions from
boiling springs to permanently frozen environments in Antarctica from salty environments like the Dead Sea to
environments under tremendous pressure such as the depths of the ocean and from areas without oxygen
such as a waste management plant to radioactively contaminated regions such as Chernobyl Prokaryotes
reside in the human digestive system and on the skin are responsible for certain illnesses and serve an
important role in the preparation of many foods
221  Prokaryotic Diversity
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the evolutionary history of prokaryotes

Discuss the distinguishing features of extremophiles

Explain why it is difficult to culture prokaryotes
Prokaryotes are ubiquitous They cover every imaginable surface where there is sufficient moisture and
they also live on and inside virtually all other living things In the typical human body prokaryotic cells
outnumber human body cells by about ten to one They comprise the majority of living things in all ecosystems
Some prokaryotes thrive in environments that are inhospitable for most living things Prokaryotes recycle
nutrientsessential substances such as carbon and nitrogenand they drive the evolution of new
ecosystems some of which are natural and others manmade Prokaryotes have been on Earth since long
before multicellular life appeared Indeed eukaryotic cells are thought to be the descendants of ancient
prokaryotic communities
Prokaryotes the First Inhabitants of Earth
When and where did cellular life begin What were the conditions on Earth when life began We now know
that prokaryotes were likely the first forms of cellular life on Earth and they existed for billions of years before
plants and animals appeared The Earth and its moon are dated at about 454 billion years in age This estimate
is based on evidence from radiometric dating of meteorite material together with other substrate material from
Earth and the moon Early Earth had a very different atmosphere contained less molecular oxygen than it does
today and was subjected to strong solar radiation thus the first organisms probably would have flourished where
they were more protected such as in the deep ocean or far beneath the surface of the Earth Strong volcanic
activity was common on Earth at this time so it is likely that these first organismsthe first prokaryoteswere
adapted to very high temperatures Because early Earth was prone to geological upheaval and volcanic eruption
and was subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation from the sun the first organisms were prokaryotes that
must have withstood these harsh conditions
Microbial Mats
Microbial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of prokaryotic life on Earth there is fossil
evidence of their presence starting about 35 billion years ago It is remarkable that cellular life appeared on
Earth only a billion years after the Earth itself formed suggesting that precellular life that could replicate itself
had evolved much earlier A microbial mat is a multilayered sheet of prokaryotes Figure 222 that includes
mostly bacteria but also archaeans Microbial mats are only a few centimeters thick and they typically grow
where different types of materials interface mostly on moist surfaces The various types of prokaryotes that
comprise them carry out different metabolic pathways and that is the reason for their various colors Prokaryotes
in a microbial mat are held together by a gluelike sticky substance that they secrete called extracellular matrix
The first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents A
hydrothermal vent is a breakage or fissure in the Earths surface that releases geothermally heated water
With the evolution of photosynthesis about three billion years ago some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to
use a more widely available energy sourcesunlightwhereas others were still dependent on chemicals from
hydrothermal vents for energy and food
