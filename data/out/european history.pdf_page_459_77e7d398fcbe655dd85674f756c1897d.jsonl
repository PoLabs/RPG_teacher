41 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE

tool maker in Glasgow These innovations and procedures originated with 
technicians rather than scientists and were soon adopted on the continent It 
was these early modern innovationswhich can at best be termed applied 
sciencewhich shaped the further course of industrialisation
The early modern period also saw the intensification of communication 
within Europe and the sophistication of trade networks and colonial 
expansion by European powers worldwide In the colonies crucial inventions 
were developed as well such as the cotton gin developed by the American 
inventor Eli Whitney 17651825 in 1793 in the recently independent United 
States This made it easier to separate the cotton fibres from the seeds of the 
plant speeding up production New techniques developed by European 
settlers and their descendants were tried out on slaves and indigenous people 
whenever this seemed profitable The exploitation of colonised people and the 
extraction of resources in many cases was the prerequisite for industrialisation 
in Europe This is the darker side of what Europeans understood by scientific 
and technological progress
Conclusion
In the early modern period science and technology were intimately connected 
Technical innovations and their diffusion were based on new bodies of 
knowledge while new devices helped to expand knowledge horizons This 
is evident on several levels From the thirteenth century onward a distinct 
written culture emerged In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries ever more 
texts were produced and read by clerics scholars and other members of the 
literate elites Gutenberg developed the printing press around 1440 making 
it easier to produce books The channels for distributing pamphlets books 
and other printed texts improved as well based on complex infrastructures of 
knowledge The result was a Republic of Letters
Science and technology developed in and through networksthe 
interpersonal communication networks of scholars artists craftsmen tinkers 
and engineers but also the material networks of infrastructure such as roads 
canals and the postal system that transported scholars letters 
Knowledge of technological innovations circulated between European 
countries and around the globe This diffusion of innovations emanated 
from the hub of Italy because craftsmen and artisans who travelled there 
brought knowledge and methods of protecting knowledge through patents 
back home with them These travellers were producers and consumers of 
technology at the same time Thus in the early modern period there was an 
intimate connection between innovation and migration This new knowledge 
was a precondition for the industrialisation that unfolded from the eighteenth 
century onward especially in England Even before the industrial revolution
