Holmes
Quite so Now turn that up in the ledger
Holmes turned to the page indicated Here you
are Mrs Oakshott 117 Brixton Road egg and poul
try supplier 
Now then whats the last entry
 December 22nd Twentyfour geese at 7s 6d 
Quite so There you are And underneath
 Sold to Mr Windigate of the Alpha at 12s 
What have you to say now
Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined He
drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down
upon the slab turning away with the air of a man
whose disgust is too deep for words A few yards
off he stopped under a lamppost and laughed in the
hearty noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him
When you see a man with whiskers of that cut
and the Pink un protruding out of his pocket you
can always draw him by a bet said he I daresay
that if I had put 100 down in front of him that man
would not have given me such complete information
as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing
me on a wager Well Watson we are I fancy nearing
the end of our quest and the only point which re
mains to be determined is whether we should go on to
this Mrs Oakshott tonight or whether we should re
serve it for tomorrow It is clear from what that surly
fellow said that there are others besides ourselves
who are anxious about the matter and I should
His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud
hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had
just left Turning round we saw a little ratfaced fel
low standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light
which was thrown by the swinging lamp while Breck
inridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall
was shaking his sts ercely at the cringing gure
Ive had enough of you and your geese he
shouted I wish you were all at the devil together If
you come pestering me any more with your silly talk
Ill set the dog at you You bring Mrs Oakshott here
and Ill answer her but what have you to do with it
Did I buy the geese off you
No but one of them was mine all the same
whined the little man
Well then ask Mrs Oakshott for it
She told me to ask you
Well you can ask the King of Proosia for all
I care Ive had enough of it Get out of this He
rushed ercely forward and the inquirer itted away
into the darkness
Ha this may save us a visit to Brixton Road
whispered Holmes Come with me and we will see
what is to be made of this fellow Striding through
the scattered knots of people who lounged round the
aring stalls my companion speedily overtook the
little man and touched him upon the shoulder He
sprang round and I could see in the gaslight that
every vestige of colour had been driven from his face
Who are you then What do you want he
asked in a quavering voice
You will excuse me said Holmes blandly but I
could not help overhearing the questions which you
put to the salesman just now I think that I could be
of assistance to you
You Who are you How could you know any
thing of the matter
My name is Sherlock Holmes It is my business
to know what other people dont know
But you can know nothing of this
Excuse me I know everything of it You are en
deavouring to trace some geese which were sold by
Mrs Oakshott of Brixton Road to a salesman named
Breckinridge by him in turn to Mr Windigate of the
Alpha and by him to his club of which Mr Henry
Baker is a member
Oh sir you are the very man whom I have longed
to meet cried the little fellow with outstretched
hands and quivering ngers I can hardly explain to
you how interested I am in this matter
Sherlock Holmes hailed a fourwheeler which was
passing In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy
room rather than in this windswept marketplace
said he But pray tell me before we go farther who
it is that I have the pleasure of assisting
The man hesitated for an instant My name is
John Robinson he answered with a sidelong glance
No no the real name said Holmes sweetly It
is always awkward doing business with an alias
A ush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger
Well then said he my real name is James Ryder
Precisely so Head attendant at the Hotel Cos
mopolitan Pray step into the cab and I shall soon be
able to tell you everything which you would wish to
know
The little man stood glancing from one to the other
of us with halffrightened halfhopeful eyes as one
