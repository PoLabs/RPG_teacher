fluid between cells
specialized organ that contains a large number of macrophages that clean the lymph before the
fluid is returned to the heart
also heart attack complete blockage of the coronary arteries and death of the cardiac
muscle tissue
heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall
system in which the blood is mixed with interstitial fluid and directly covers the organs
plural ostia holes between blood vessels that allow the movement of hemolymph through the body of
insects arthropods and mollusks with open circulatory systems
membrane layer protecting the heart also part of the epicardium
resistance of the artery and blood vessel walls to the pressure placed on them by the
force of the heart pumping
liquid component of blood that is left after the cells are removed
also thrombocyte small cellular fragment that collects at wounds crossreacts with clotting factors
and forms a plug to prevent blood loss
small muscle that controls blood circulation in the capillary beds
circulatory system in amphibians the flow of blood to the lungs and the moist skin
for gas exchange
flow of blood away from the heart through the lungs where oxygenation occurs and then
returns to the heart again
small 78 m biconcave cell without mitochondria and in mammals without nuclei that is
packed with hemoglobin giving the cell its red color transports oxygen through the body
membranous flap of connective tissue between the aorta and a ventricle of the heart the aortic
or pulmonary semilunar valves
plasma without the coagulation factors
the hearts internal pacemaker located near the wall of the right atrium
the volume of blood pumped into the aorta per contraction of the left ventricle
drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come
from the arms
flow of blood away from the heart to the brain liver kidneys stomach and other organs
the limbs and the muscles of the body and then the return of this blood to the heart
contraction phase of cardiac cycle when the ventricles are pumping blood into the arteries
oneway membranous flap of connective tissue between the atrium and the ventricle in the right
side of the heart also known as atrioventricular valve
flow of blood in a single circuit occurs in fish where the blood flows through the gills
then past the organs and the rest of the body before returning to the heart
narrowing of a blood vessel
widening of a blood vessel
