Figure 2324 Paramecium Paramecium has a primitive mouth called an oral groove to ingest food and an anal
pore to eliminate waste Contractile vacuoles allow the organism to excrete excess water Cilia enable the organism to

Paramecium has two nuclei a macronucleus and a micronucleus in each cell The micronucleus is essential
for sexual reproduction and is in many ways a typical eukaryotic nucleus except that its genes are not
transcribed The transcribed nucleus is the macronucleus which directs asexual binary fission and all other
biological functions The macronucleus is a multiploid nucleus constructed from the micronucleus during sexual
reproduction Periodic reconstruction of the macronucleus is necessary because the macronucleus divides
amitotically and thus becomes genetically unbalanced over a period of successive cell replications Paramecium
and most other ciliates reproduce sexually by conjugation This process begins when two different mating
types of Paramecium make physical contact and join with a cytoplasmic bridge Figure 2325 The diploid
micronucleus in each cell then undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid micronuclei Three of these
degenerate in each cell leaving one micronucleus that then undergoes mitosis generating two haploid
micronuclei The cells each exchange one of these haploid nuclei and move away from each other Fusion of
the haploid micronuclei generates a completely novel diploid premicronucleus in each conjugative cell This
premicronucleus undergoes three rounds of mitosis to produce eight copies and the original macronucleus
disintegrates Four of the eight premicronuclei become fullfledged micronuclei whereas the other four perform
multiple rounds of DNA replication The copies of the micronuclear chromosomes are severely edited to
form hundreds of smaller chromosomes that contain only the protein coding genes Each of these smaller
chromosomes gets new telomeres as the macronucleus differentiates Two cycles of cell division then yield four
new Paramecia from each original conjugative cell
