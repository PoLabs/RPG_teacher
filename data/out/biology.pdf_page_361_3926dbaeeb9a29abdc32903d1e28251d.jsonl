Testing the Hypothesis of Independent Assortment
To better appreciate the amount of labor and ingenuity that went into Mendels experiments proceed
through one of Mendels dihybrid crosses
Question What will be the offspring of a dihybrid cross
Background Consider that pea plants mature in one growing season and you have access to a large
garden in which you can cultivate thousands of pea plants There are several truebreeding plants with the
following pairs of traits tall plants with inflated pods and dwarf plants with constricted pods Before the
plants have matured you remove the pollenproducing organs from the tallinflated plants in your crosses to
prevent selffertilization Upon plant maturation the plants are manually crossed by transferring pollen from
the dwarfconstricted plants to the stigmata of the tallinflated plants
Hypothesis Both trait pairs will sort independently according to Mendelian laws When the truebreeding
parents are crossed all of the F1 offspring are tall and have inflated pods which indicates that the tall
and inflated traits are dominant over the dwarf and constricted traits respectively A selfcross of the F1
heterozygotes results in 2000 F2 progeny
Test the hypothesis Because each trait pair sorts independently the ratios of talldwarf and
inflatedconstricted are each expected to be 31 The talldwarf trait pair is called Tt and the inflated
constricted trait pair is designated Ii Each member of the F1 generation therefore has a genotype of TtIi
Construct a grid analogous to Figure 1216 in which you cross two TtIi individuals Each individual can
donate four combinations of two traits TI Ti tI or ti meaning that there are 16 possibilities of offspring
genotypes Because the T and I alleles are dominant any individual having one or two of those alleles
will express the tall or inflated phenotypes respectively regardless if they also have a t or i allele Only
individuals that are tt or ii will express the dwarf and constricted alleles respectively As shown in Figure
1219 you predict that you will observe the following offspring proportions tallinflatedtallconstricteddwarf
inflateddwarfconstricted in a 9331 ratio Notice from the grid that when considering the talldwarf and
inflatedconstricted trait pairs in isolation they are each inherited in 31 ratios
Figure 1219 This figure shows all possible combinations of offspring resulting from a dihybrid cross of pea plants
that are heterozygous for the talldwarf and inflatedconstricted alleles
Test the hypothesis You cross the dwarf and tall plants and then selfcross the offspring For best results
this is repeated with hundreds or even thousands of pea plants What special precautions should be taken
in the crosses and in growing the plants
