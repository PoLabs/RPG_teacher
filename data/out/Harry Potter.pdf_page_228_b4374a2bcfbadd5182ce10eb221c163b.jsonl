dont hang around once youve won
He stepped forward and the white queen pounced She struck Ron hard
across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor 
Hermione screamed but stayed on her square  the white queen dragged Ron
to one side He looked as if hed been knocked out
Shaking Harry moved three spaces to the left
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harrys feet They had
won The chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear With
one last desperate look back at Ron Harry and Hermione charged through
the door and up the next passageway
What if hes 
Hell be all right said Harry trying to convince himself What do
you reckons next
Weve had Sprouts that was the Devils Snare Flitwick mustve put
charms on the keys McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them
alive that leaves Quirrells spell and Snapes
They had reached another door
All right Harry whispered
Go on
Harry pushed it open
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their
robes up over their noses Eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in
front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out
cold with a bloody lump on its head
Im glad we didnt have to fight that one Harry whispered as they
stepped carefully over one of its massive legs Come on I cant
breathe
He pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what
came next  but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table
with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line
