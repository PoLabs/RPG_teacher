four extraembryonic membranes The amniotes include reptiles birds and mammals The early amniotes
diverged into two main lines soon after the first amniotes arose The initial split was into synapsids mammals
and sauropsids Sauropsids can be further divided into anapsids and diapsids crocodiles dinosaurs birds and
modern reptiles
Reptiles are tetrapods that ancestrally had four limbs however a number of extant species have secondarily
lost them or greatly reduced them over evolutionary time For example limbless reptiles eg snakes are
classified as tetrapods because they descended from ancestors with four limbs One of the key adaptations
that permitted reptiles to live on land was the development of scaly skin containing the protein keratin which
prevented water loss from the skin Reptilia includes four living clades of nonavian organisms Crocodilia
crocodiles and alligators Sphenodontia tuataras Squamata lizards and snakes and Testudines turtles
Currently this classification is paraphyletic leaving out the birds which are now classified as avian reptiles in
the class Reptilia
295 Birds
Birds are the most speciose group of land vertebrates and display a number of adaptations related to their
ability to fly which were first present in their therapod maniraptoran ancestors Birds are endothermic and
homeothermic meaning they have a very high metabolism that produces a considerable amount of heat as
well as structures such as feathers that allow them to retain their own body heat These adaptations are used
to regulate their internal temperature making it largely independent of ambient thermal conditions
Birds have feathers which allow for insulation and flight as well as for mating and warning signals Flight
feathers have a broad and continuously curved vane that produces lift Some birds have pneumatic bones
containing air spaces that are sometimes connected to air sacs in the body cavity Airflow through bird lungs
travels in one direction creating a countercurrent gas exchange with the blood
Birds are highly modified diapsids and belong to a group called the archosaurs Within the archosaurs birds
are most likely evolved from theropod maniraptoran dinosaurs One of the oldest known fossils and best
known of a dinosaurbird is that of Archaeopteryx which is dated from the Jurassic period Modern birds are
now classified into three groups Paleognathae Galloanserae and Neoaves
296 Mammals
Mammals are vertebrates that possess hair and mammary glands The mammalian integument includes
various secretory glands including sebaceous glands eccrine glands apocrine glands and mammary glands
Mammals are synapsids meaning that they have a single opening in the skull behind the eye Mammals
probably evolved from therapsids in the late Triassic period as the earliest known mammal fossils are from the
early Jurassic period A key characteristic of synapsids is endothermy and most mammals are homeothermic
There are three groups of mammals living today monotremes marsupials and eutherians Monotremes are
unique among mammals as they lay eggs rather than giving birth to young Marsupials give birth to very
immature young which typically complete their development in a pouch Eutherian mammals are sometimes
called placental mammals because all species possess a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the
mother allowing for gas fluid and nutrient exchange All mammals nourish their young with milk which is
derived from modified sweat or sebaceous glands
297 The Evolution of Primates
All primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees and probably descended from arboreal ancestors
although not all living species are arboreal Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger relative
to body size than those of other mammals claws that have been modified into flattened nails typically only
one young per pregnancy stereoscopic vision and a trend toward holding the body upright Primates are
divided into two groups strepsirrhines which include most prosimians and haplorhines which include simians
Monkeys evolved from prosimians during the Oligocene epoch The simian line includes both platyrrhine and
catarrhine branches Apes evolved from catarrhines in Africa during the Miocene epoch Apes are divided into
the lesser apes and the greater apes Hominins include those groups that gave rise to our own species such
as Australopithecus and H erectus and those groups that can be considered cousins of humans such as
Neanderthals and Denisovans Fossil evidence shows that hominins at the time of Australopithecus were
walking upright the first evidence of bipedal hominins A number of species sometimes called archaic H
sapiens evolved from H erectus approximately 500000 years ago There is considerable debate about the
origins of anatomically modern humans or H sapiens sapiens and the discussion will continue as new
