affected the more urbanised areas of Western Europe whichin part due to 
ensuing labour shortagesexperienced rising real wages and thus moved 
towards an extensification of agricultural production Eastern Europe which 
was less urbanised was comparatively less affected in socioeconomic terms
Scholars continue to dispute and debate the driving force behind European 
economic development during the early modern period Explanations range 
from material production to military competition from higher levels of 
productivity industriousness to the institutional framework and from 
fiscalfinancial innovation to a range of cultural traits Whatever the ultimate 
causes there exists a wealth of empirical evidence that documents gradual if 
nonlinear shifts in population and occupational structures as well as labour 
productivity in both Eastern and Western Europe from the late Middle Ages 
through the early modern period
Despite increasingly organised warfare demographic reconstructions 
indicate that Europes population roughly doubled between 1500 and 1800 
Both England and the Low Countries were outliers in these trends with 
much larger increases in urban and rural nonagricultural sectors Europes 
agricultural population grew less and averaged ca thirtyfive to thirtynine 
percent during the same period Recent reconstructions of economic output 
reveal strikingly similar patterns of low growth all across Europe These 
results are buttressed by largely analogous trends in fertility life expectancy 
and mortality all of which remained virtually constant throughout the early 
modern period
Taken together these findings reveal an ambiguous image of early 
modern Europe While population increased everywhere growth was most 
pronounced in England and the Low Countries Demographic growth affected 
all sectors with most indicators pointing to small differences in the increase 
of the agricultural population By contrast the rural nonagricultural sectors 
show much larger variation with growth ranging from a low thirty percent 
in Southern Europe to much higher growth indicators in the Low Countries 
Poland and England
In terms of population distribution by sector urban rural nonagricultural 
agricultural the following trends across early modern Europe are apparent 
Around 1500 urbanisation outside Northern Italy twentytwo percent and 
the Low Countries twentyeight to twentynine percent averaged less than ten 
percent Early modern Europes rural nonagricultural population averaged 
around eighteen percent of the workforce with the agricultural population 
standing at roughly three quarters By contrast around 1750 urbanisation 
rates of about twentytwo to twentythree percent are documented for 
England Belgium Northern Italy and Spain with the Netherlands firmly in 
the lead at thirtysix percent Even more significant changes had occurred in
