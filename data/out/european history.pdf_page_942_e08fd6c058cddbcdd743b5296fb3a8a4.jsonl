Blejovsk shows when and how our predecessors accepted the Christian 
faith and seeks to prove that from the very beginning these predecessors 
served the Eucharist in both forms as they had since the days of St Cyril and 
Methodius since the ninth century The heirs of this tradition are according 
to Blejovsk Utraquists Blejovsk also argues for a continuity of liturgy in 
a Slavic language For Blejovsk the Holy Eucharist in both forms was first 
doubted by Germans in Bohemia at the beginning of the fifteenth century 
the Germans came to Bohemia in tremendously huge numbers particularly 
to its university and were helping ecclesiastics opposing the truththat is 
they fought against the Holy Eucharist of the Body and Blood of Christ The 
confessional factor was however more important than the national difference 
for Blejovsk Many biblical parallels are present here with a clear comparison 
of the Czech Hussites and the people of Israel 
Hjeks different take on the mythic history of pagan Czechs is noteworthy
it was not so important for Blejovsk Hjek presents it as an integral part 
of Czech history and discusses it with exact data This is why Libuethe 
legendary ancestor of the Pemyslid dynasty which ruled Bohemia and 
a purported prophetis a real Czech duchess for him the matriarch of the 
Czech tribe who according to Hjeks story actually contributed in the mid
eighth century to the construction of the Czech state its power structure its 
castles and towns its economy and its legal system Hjek also disputed the 
idea that Slavic Bohemia was in fact German land as Pope Pius II 14051464 
and many others argued Hjek reached an interesting compromise saying 
that we Czechs have our land from Germans and our kin and language from 
Slovaks ie Slavs 
In Hjeks narration many events have a clear national rather than 
confessional edge The Battle of Brdek in the umava Mountains in 1040 
in which the Czech duke Betislav defeated the RomanGerman King is an 
illustrative example This event was cherished by many generations of Czech 
nationaliststhroughout history a victory of Czechs over Germans was hard 
to find 
Hjeks chronicle influenced many subsequent generations of Czech 
historians much more than Blejovsk although it cannot be labelled official 
state historiography unlike for example the Book of Martyrs in England which 
is discussed in the next section It is also worth mentioning that his work was 
translated into German quite early in 1596 and it influenced the whole of 
Europe through the Latin history of Ioannes Dubravius Bishop of Olomouc 
who accepted many of Hjeks theses and stories
The works of these two authors highlight features of Bohemian 
historiography of the time which was not only confessional while religious 
confrontation was present the need to catch up with neighbouring Germans
