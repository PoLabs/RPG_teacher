and on to the stomach
To help digest the large amount of plant material the stomach of the ruminants is a multichambered organ as
illustrated in Figure 348 The four compartments of the stomach are called the rumen reticulum omasum and
abomasum These chambers contain many microbes that breakdown cellulose and ferment ingested food The
abomasum is the true stomach and is the equivalent of the monogastric stomach chamber where gastric juices
are secreted The fourcompartment gastric chamber provides larger space and the microbial support necessary
to digest plant material in ruminants The fermentation process produces large amounts of gas in the stomach
chamber which must be eliminated As in other animals the small intestine plays an important role in nutrient
absorption and the large intestine helps in the elimination of waste
Figure 348 Ruminant animals such as goats and cows have four stomachs The first two stomachs the rumen and
the reticulum contain prokaryotes and protists that are able to digest cellulose fiber The ruminant regurgitates cud
from the reticulum chews it and swallows it into a third stomach the omasum which removes water The cud then
passes onto the fourth stomach the abomasum where it is digested by enzymes produced by the ruminant
Pseudoruminants
Some animals such as camels and alpacas are pseudoruminants They eat a lot of plant material and
roughage Digesting plant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule
cellulose The digestive enzymes of these animals cannot breakdown cellulose but microorganisms present in
the digestive system can Therefore the digestive system must be able to handle large amounts of roughage and
breakdown the cellulose Pseudoruminants have a threechamber stomach in the digestive system However
their cecuma pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine containing many microorganisms that are
necessary for the digestion of plant materialsis large and is the site where the roughage is fermented and
digested These animals do not have a rumen but have an omasum abomasum and reticulum
Parts of the Digestive System
The vertebrate digestive system is designed to facilitate the transformation of food matter into the nutrient
components that sustain organisms
Oral Cavity
The oral cavity or mouth is the point of entry of food into the digestive system illustrated in Figure 349 The
food consumed is broken into smaller particles by mastication the chewing action of the teeth All mammals
have teeth and can chew their food
The extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth As food is being chewed saliva produced by
