CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
23 What are the characteristic features of the
chordates
24 What is the structural advantage of the notochord
in the human embryo Be sure to compare the
notochord with the corresponding structure in adults
25 What can be inferred about the evolution of the
cranium and vertebral column from examining
hagfishes and lampreys
26 Why did gnathostomes replace most agnathans
27 Explain why frogs are restricted to a moist
environment
28 Describe the differences between the larval and
adult stages of frogs
29 Describe how metamorphosis changes the
structures involved in gas exchange over the life
cycle of animals in the clade Anura and what
evolutionary advantage this change provides
30 Describe the functions of the three extra
embryonic membranes present in amniotic eggs
31 What characteristics differentiate lizards and
snakes
32 Based on how reptiles thermoregulate which
climates would you predict to have the highest reptile
population density and why
33 Explain why birds are thought to have evolved
from theropod dinosaurs
34 Describe three skeletal adaptations that allow for
flight in birds
35 How would the chest structure differ between
ostriches penguins and terns
36 Describe three unique features of the mammalian
skeletal system
37 Describe three characteristics of the mammalian
brain that differ from other vertebrates
38 How did the evolution of jaw musculature allow
mammals to spread
39 How did archaic Homo sapiens differ from
anatomically modern humans
40 Why is it so difficult to determine the sequence of
hominin ancestors that have led to modern Homo
sapiens
