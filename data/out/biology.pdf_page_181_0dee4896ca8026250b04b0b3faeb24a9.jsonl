7 A scientist compares the plasma membrane
composition of an animal from the Mediterranean
coast with one from the Mojave Desert Which
hypothesis is most likely to be correct

The cells from the Mediterranean coast
animal will have more fluid plasma
membranes
b
The cells from the Mojave Desert animal will
have a higher cholesterol concentration in
the plasma membranes
c
The cells plasma membranes will be
indistinguishable
d
The cells from the Mediterranean coast
animal will have a higher glycoprotein
content while the cells from the Mojave
Desert animal will have a higher lipoprotein
content
8 Water moves via osmosis _________
a
throughout the cytoplasm
b
from an area with a high concentration of
other solutes to a lower one
c
from an area with a high concentration of
water to one of lower concentration
d
from an area with a low concentration of
water to higher concentration
9 The principal force driving movement in diffusion is
the __________
a
temperature
b
particle size
c
concentration gradient
d
membrane surface area
10 What problem is faced by organisms that live in
fresh water
a
Their bodies tend to take in too much water
b
They have no way of controlling their
tonicity
c
Only salt water poses problems for animals
that live in it
d
Their bodies tend to lose too much water to
their environment
11 In which situation would passive transport not
use a transport protein for entry into a cell
a
water flowing into a hypertonic environment
b
glucose being absorbed from the blood
c
an ion flowing into a nerve cell to create an
electrical potential
d
oxygen moving into a cell after oxygen
deprivation
12 Active transport must function continuously
because __________
a
plasma membranes wear out
b
not all membranes are amphiphilic
c
facilitated transport opposes active transport
d
diffusion is constantly moving solutes in
opposite directions
13 How does the sodiumpotassium pump make the
interior of the cell negatively charged
a
by expelling anions
b
by pulling in anions
c
by expelling more cations than are taken in
d
by taking in and expelling an equal number
of cations
14 What is the combination of an electrical gradient
and a concentration gradient called
a
potential gradient
b
electrical potential
c
concentration potential
d
electrochemical gradient
15 What happens to the membrane of a vesicle after
exocytosis
a
It leaves the cell
b
It is disassembled by the cell
c
It fuses with and becomes part of the
plasma membrane
d
It is used again in another exocytosis event
16 Which transport mechanism can bring whole cells
into a cell
a
pinocytosis
b
phagocytosis
c
facilitated transport
d
primary active transport
17 In what important way does receptormediated
endocytosis differ from phagocytosis
a
It transports only small amounts of fluid
b
It does not involve the pinching off of
membrane
c
It brings in only a specifically targeted
substance
d
It brings substances into the cell while
phagocytosis removes substances
18 Many viruses enter host cells through receptor
mediated endocytosis What is an advantage of this
entry strategy
a
The virus directly enters the cytoplasm of
the cell
b
The virus is protected from recognition by
white blood cells
c
The virus only enters its target host cell
type
d
The virus can directly inject its genome into
the cells nucleus
19 Which of the following organelles relies on
exocytosis to complete its function
a
Golgi apparatus
b
vacuole
c
mitochondria
d
endoplasmic reticulum
20 Imagine a cell can perform exocytosis but only
minimal endocytosis What would happen to the cell
