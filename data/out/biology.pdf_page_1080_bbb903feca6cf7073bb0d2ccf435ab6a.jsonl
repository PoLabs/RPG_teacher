Figure 354 There is great diversity in the size and shape of neurons throughout the nervous system Examples include
a a pyramidal cell from the cerebral cortex b a Purkinje cell from the cerebellar cortex and c olfactory cells from
the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb
While there are many defined neuron cell subtypes neurons are broadly divided into four basic types unipolar
bipolar multipolar and pseudounipolar Figure 355 illustrates these four basic neuron types Unipolar neurons
have only one structure that extends away from the soma These neurons are not found in vertebrates but
are found in insects where they stimulate muscles or glands A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite
extending from the soma An example of a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell which receives signals from
photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to
the brain Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron Each multipolar neuron contains one axon
and multiple dendrites Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system brain and spinal cord
An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum which has many branching dendrites but
only one axon Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells A pseudounipolar
cell has a single process that extends from the soma like a unipolar cell but this process later branches into two
distinct structures like a bipolar cell Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches
into two extensions one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this
information to the spinal cord
Figure 355 Neurons are broadly divided into four main types based on the number and placement of axons 1
