It is worth noting that these groups were differentiated not only by their 
languages and religions but also by their professions and their geographic 
distribution The diversity of the PolishLithuanian population was further 
increased by the immigration of groups of Dutch Italians and Scots some 
of which enjoyed limited forms of communal autonomy In fact the only 
group never granted such a status were the Roma whom the Poles regarded 
as economically socially and politically unimportant The greatest measure 
of autonomy was accorded to the Jewish community which had the right to 
administer its members across PolandLithuania independent of their specific 
places of residence Similar arrangements allowing even for a measure of 
stateenforceable jurisdiction in internal matters existed for Christian and 
Jewish communities in the Ottoman Empire as well as for expatriates such 
as merchants officially recognised by the Ottoman sultans This model was 
at times applied to settler communities within Europe such as the Huguenot 
immigrants to various German states see Chapter 131
Such multicultural multilingual and multireligious societies were not 
free from conflict Throughout the early modern period PolandLithuania 
witnessed several riots over ethnic and communal differences and occasionally 
minorities were expelled This happened for example to the Protestant 
Socinian Society also called the Polish Brethren during the PolishSwedish 
War 16551660 The Socinians afterwards took refuge in the Netherlands the 
nonPolish part of Prussia and Transylvania which provided a safe haven for 
a number of radical Protestant groups from all over Europe see Chapter 131
The relative political weakness of PolandLithuanias royal government 
and the limited power of its king in this period is comparable perhaps only 
to the situation in the Holy Roman Empire This potentially gave individual 
groups greater bargaining power here than elsewhere in Europe but the 
overall pattern of organisation and cohabitation was by no means unique
Outsiders Within Jews and Roma
Stateless and scattered across numerous countries Jews and Roma were often 
referred to as strangers within troublemakers or enemies by the dominant 
societies of early modern Europe However a clear ethnic social or religious 
classification was considered difficult Jews who formed the largest minority 
in early modern Europe were understood as both an ethnic and a religious 
community Their position was fraught with a great deal of ambivalence 
While Christian majority societies sometimes regarded them as witnesses of 
faith who were worthy of protection Jews were also aggressively stigmatised 
as blasphemers and diabolical evildoers or even held responsible for the 
death of Christ And although customs rites laws and languages including
