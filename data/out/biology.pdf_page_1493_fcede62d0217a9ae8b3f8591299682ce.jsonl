Figure 4622 At this sulfur vent in Lassen Volcanic National Park in northeastern California the yellowish sulfur
deposits are visible near the mouth of the vent
Sulfur enters the ocean via runoff from land from atmospheric fallout and from underwater geothermal vents
Some ecosystems Figure 469 rely on chemoautotrophs using sulfur as a biological energy source This sulfur
then supports marine ecosystems in the form of sulfates
Human activities have played a major role in altering the balance of the global sulfur cycle The burning of
large quantities of fossil fuels especially from coal releases larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas into the
atmosphere Acid rain is caused by rainwater falling to the ground through this sulfur dioxide gas turning it into
weak sulfuric acid Acid rain damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes which kills many of
the resident fauna it also affects the manmade environment through the chemical degradation of buildings For
example many marble monuments such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC have suffered significant
damage from acid rain over the years
