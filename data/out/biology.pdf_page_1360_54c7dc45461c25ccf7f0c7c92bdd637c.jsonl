LH cause the growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary This process prepares the egg for ovulation As
the follicles grow they begin releasing estrogens and a low level of progesterone Progesterone maintains the
endometrium to help ensure pregnancy The trip through the fallopian tube takes about seven days At this stage
of development called the morula there are 3060 cells If pregnancy implantation does not occur the lining is
sloughed off After about five days estrogen levels rise and the menstrual cycle enters the proliferative phase
The endometrium begins to regrow replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated during the end of
the last cycle
Figure 4315 The ovarian and menstrual cycles of female reproduction are regulated by hormones produced by
the hypothalamus pituitary and ovaries
Which of the following statements about hormone regulation of the female reproductive cycle is false
a
LH and FSH are produced in the pituitary and estradiol and progesterone are produced in the ovaries
b
Estradiol and progesterone secreted from the corpus luteum cause the endometrium to thicken
c
Both progesterone and estradiol are produced by the follicles
d
Secretion of GnRH by the hypothalamus is inhibited by low levels of estradiol but stimulated by high
levels of estradiol
Just prior to the middle of the cycle approximately day 14 the high level of estrogen causes FSH and especially
LH to rise rapidly then fall The spike in LH causes ovulation the most mature follicle like that shown in Figure
