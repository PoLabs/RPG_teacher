KEY TERMS
plant hormone that induces dormancy in seeds and other organs
physiological process that leads to the fall of a plant organ such as leaf or petal drop
aboveground root that arises from a plant part other than the radicle of the plant embryo
bud formed at the tip of the shoot
meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots enables a plant to extend in length
plant hormone that influences cell elongation in phototropism gravitropism apical dominance and root
growth
bud located in the axil the stem area where the petiole connects to the stem
tough waterproof outer epidermal layer of cork cells
modified underground stem that consists of a large bud surrounded by numerous leaf scales
waxy coating that forces water to cross endodermal plasma membranes before entering the
vascular cylinder instead of moving between endodermal cells
molecule that absorbs light
elongated plant cell with unevenly thickened walls provides structural support to the stem
and leaves
phloem cell that is connected to sievetube cells has large amounts of ribosomes and
mitochondria
leaf in which the leaf blade is subdivided to form leaflets all attached to the midrib
rounded fleshy underground stem that contains stored food
ground tissue found between the vascular tissue and the epidermis in a stem or root
protein that absorbs light in the blue and ultraviolet regions of the light spectrum
waxy protective layer on the leaf surface
waxy covering on the outside of the leaf and stem that prevents the loss of water
plant hormone that promotes cell division
protective plant tissue covering the outermost part of the plant controls gas exchange
layer of cells in the root that forms a selective barrier between the ground tissue and the vascular
tissue allowing water and minerals to enter the root while excluding toxins and pathogens
single layer of cells found in plant dermal tissue covers and protects underlying tissue
volatile plant hormone that is associated with fruit ripening flower wilting and leaf fall
type of root system in which the roots arise from the base of the stem in a cluster forming
a dense network of roots found in monocots
plant hormone that stimulates shoot elongation seed germination and the maturation and
dropping of fruit and flowers
plant tissue involved in photosynthesis provides support and stores water and sugars
