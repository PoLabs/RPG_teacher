The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor
matter up so much public attention has now
been drawn to it that no good purpose can be
served by affecting to disregard what is a com
mon subject for conversation
 The ceremony which was performed at St
Georges Hanover Square was a very quiet
one no one being present save the father of
the bride Mr Aloysius Doran the Duchess of
Balmoral Lord Backwater Lord Eustace and
Lady Clara St Simon the younger brother
and sister of the bridegroom and Lady Alicia
Whittington The whole party proceeded af
terwards to the house of Mr Aloysius Doran
at Lancaster Gate where breakfast had been
prepared It appears that some little trouble
was caused by a woman whose name has not
been ascertained who endeavoured to force
her way into the house after the bridal party
alleging that she had some claim upon Lord
St Simon It was only after a painful and
prolonged scene that she was ejected by the
butler and the footman The bride who had
fortunately entered the house before this un
pleasant interruption had sat down to break
fast with the rest when she complained of a
sudden indisposition and retired to her room
Her prolonged absence having caused some
comment her father followed her but learned
from her maid that she had only come up to
her chamber for an instant caught up an ul
ster and bonnet and hurried down to the pas
sage One of the footmen declared that he had
seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled
but had refused to credit that it was his mis
tress believing her to be with the company
On ascertaining that his daughter had disap
peared Mr Aloysius Doran in conjunction
with the bridegroom instantly put themselves
in communication with the police and very
energetic inquiries are being made which will
probably result in a speedy clearing up of this
very singular business Up to a late hour last
night however nothing had transpired as to
the whereabouts of the missing lady There
are rumours of foul play in the matter and
it is said that the police have caused the ar
rest of the woman who had caused the origi
nal disturbance in the belief that from jeal
ousy or some other motive she may have been
concerned in the strange disappearance of the
bride 
And is that all
Only one little item in another of the morning
papers but it is a suggestive one
And it is
That Miss Flora Millar the lady who had caused
the disturbance has actually been arrested It appears
that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro and
that she has known the bridegroom for some years
There are no further particulars and the whole case
is in your hands nowso far as it has been set forth
in the public press
And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to
be I would not have missed it for worlds But there is
a ring at the bell Watson and as the clock makes it a
few minutes after four I have no doubt that this will
prove to be our noble client Do not dream of going
Watson for I very much prefer having a witness if
only as a check to my own memory
Lord Robert St Simon announced our pageboy
throwing open the door A gentleman entered with
a pleasant cultured face highnosed and pale with
something perhaps of petulance about the mouth
and with the steady wellopened eye of a man whose
pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be
obeyed His manner was brisk and yet his general
appearance gave an undue impression of age for he
had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the
knees as he walked His hair too as he swept off
his very curlybrimmed hat was grizzled round the
edges and thin upon the top As to his dress it was
careful to the verge of foppishness with high col
lar black frockcoat white waistcoat yellow gloves
patentleather shoes and lightcoloured gaiters He
advanced slowly into the room turning his head from
left to right and swinging in his right hand the cord
which held his golden eyeglasses
Goodday Lord St Simon said Holmes rising
and bowing Pray take the basketchair This is my
friend and colleague Dr Watson Draw up a little to
the re and we will talk this matter over
A most painful matter to me as you can most
readily imagine Mr Holmes I have been cut to the
quick I understand that you have already managed
several delicate cases of this sort sir though I pre
sume that they were hardly from the same class of
society
No I am descending
I beg pardon
My last client of the sort was a king
Oh really I had no idea And which king
The King of Scandinavia
What Had he lost his wife
