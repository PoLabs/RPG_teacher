the whiptail lizards on the other hand only female progeny are produced by parthenogenesis These animals
may not be identical to their parent although they have only maternal chromosomes However for animals that
are limited in their access to mates uniparental reproduction can ensure genetic propagation
In animals the zygote progresses through a series of developmental stages during which primary germ
layers ectoderm endoderm and mesoderm are established and reorganize to form an embryo During this
process animal tissues begin to specialize and organize into organs and organ systems determining their future
morphology and physiology
Animal development begins with cleavage a series of mitotic cell divisions of the zygote Figure 273
Cleavage differs from somatic cell division in that the egg is subdivided by successive cleavages into smaller
and smaller cells with no actual cell growth The cells resulting from subdivision of the material of the egg in
this way are called blastomeres Three cell divisions transform the singlecelled zygote into an eightcelled
structure After further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells a solid morula is formed followed by
a hollow structure called a blastula The blastula is hollow only in invertebrates whose eggs have relatively
small amounts of yolk In very yolky eggs of vertebrates the yolk remains undivided with most cells forming an
embryonic layer on the surface of the yolk imagine a chicken embryo growing over the eggs yolk which serve
as food for the developing embryo
Further cell division and cellular rearrangement leads to a process called gastrulation Gastrulation results in
two important events the formation of the primitive gut archenteron or digestive cavity and the formation of
the embryonic germ layers as we have discussed above These germ layers are programmed to develop into
certain tissue types organs and organ systems during a process called organogenesis Diploblastic organisms
have two germ layers endoderm and ectoderm Endoderm forms the wall of the digestive tract and ectoderm
covers the surface of the animal In triploblastic animals a third layer forms mesoderm which differentiates into
various structures between the ectoderm and endoderm including the lining of the body cavity
Figure 273 Development of a simple embryo During embryonic development the zygote undergoes a series of
mitotic cell divisions or cleavages that subdivide the egg into smaller and smaller blastomeres Note that the 8cell
stage and the blastula are about the same size as the original zygote In many invertebrates the blastula consists of
a single layer of cells around a hollow space During a process called gastrulation the cells from the blastula move
inward on one side to form an inner cavity This inner cavity becomes the primitive gut archenteron of the gastrula
little gut stage The opening into this cavity is called the blastopore and in some invertebrates it is destined to form
the mouth
Some animals produce larval forms that are different from the adult In insects with incomplete metamorphosis
such as grasshoppers the young resemble wingless adults but gradually produce larger and larger wing
buds during successive molts until finally producing functional wings and sex organs during the last molt
Other animals such as some insects and echinoderms undergo complete metamorphosis in which the embryo
develops into one or more feeding larval stages that may differ greatly in structure and function from the
adult Figure 274 The adult body then develops from one or more regions of larval tissue For animals
with complete metamorphosis the larva and the adult may have different diets limiting competition for food
between them Regardless of whether a species undergoes complete or incomplete metamorphosis the series
of developmental stages of the embryo remains largely the same for most members of the animal kingdom
