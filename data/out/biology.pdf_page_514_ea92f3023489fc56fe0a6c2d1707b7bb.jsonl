Figure 1813 The honeycreeper birds illustrate adaptive radiation From one original species of bird multiple others
evolved each with its own distinctive characteristics
Notice the differences in the species beaks in Figure 1813 Evolution in response to natural selection based
on specific food sources in each new habitat led to evolution of a different beak suited to the specific food
source The seedeating bird has a thicker stronger beak which is suited to break hard nuts The nectareating
birds have long beaks to dip into flowers to reach the nectar The insecteating birds have beaks like swords
appropriate for stabbing and impaling insects Darwins finches are another example of adaptive radiation in an
archipelago

Sympatric Speciation
Can divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and
reproduce in the same habitat The answer is yes We call the process of speciation within the same space
sympatric The prefix sym means same so sympatric means same homeland in contrast to allopatric
meaning other homeland Scientists have proposed and studied many mechanisms
One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division In a normal cell
division event chromosomes replicate pair up and then separate so that each new cell has the same number
of chromosomes However sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few
individual chromosomes in a condition that we call aneuploidy Figure 1814
