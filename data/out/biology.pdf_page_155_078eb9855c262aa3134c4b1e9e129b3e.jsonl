Figure 52 The plasma membrane fluid mosaic model describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination of
phospholipids cholesterol and proteins Carbohydrates attached to lipids glycolipids and to proteins glycoproteins
extend from the membranes outwardfacing surface
A plasma membranes principal components are lipids phospholipids and cholesterol proteins and
carbohydrates attached to some of the lipids and proteins A phospholipid is a molecule consisting of glycerol
two fatty acids and a phosphatelinked head group Cholesterol another lipid comprised of four fused carbon
rings is situated alongside the phospholipids in the membranes core The protein lipid and carbohydrate
proportions in the plasma membrane vary with cell type but for a typical human cell protein accounts for about
50 percent of the composition by mass lipids of all types account for about 40 percent and carbohydrates
comprise the remaining 10 percent However protein and lipid concentration varies with different cell
membranes For example myelin an outgrowth of specialized cells membrane that insulates the peripheral
nerves axons contains only 18 percent protein and 76 percent lipid The mitochondrial inner membrane contains
76 percent protein and only 24 percent lipid The plasma membrane of human red blood cells is 30 percent
lipid Carbohydrates are present only on the plasma membranes exterior surface and are attached to proteins
forming glycoproteins or attached to lipids forming glycolipids
Phospholipids
The membranes main fabric comprises amphiphilic phospholipid molecules The hydrophilic or waterloving
areas of these molecules which look like a collection of balls in an artists rendition of the model Figure 52
are in contact with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell Hydrophobic or waterhating molecules
tend to be nonpolar They interact with other nonpolar molecules in chemical reactions but generally do not
interact with polar molecules When placed in water hydrophobic molecules tend to form a ball or cluster The
phospholipids hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with water and other polar molecules on both the cells
exterior and interior Thus the membrane surfaces that face the cells interior and exterior are hydrophilic In
contrast the cell membranes interior is hydrophobic and will not interact with water Therefore phospholipids
form an excellent twolayer cell membrane that separates fluid within the cell from the fluid outside the cell
A phospholipid molecule Figure 53 consists of a threecarbon glycerol backbone with two fatty acid molecules
attached to carbons 1 and 2 and a phosphatecontaining group attached to the third carbon This arrangement
gives the overall molecule a head area the phosphatecontaining group which has a polar character or
negative charge and a tail area the fatty acids which has no charge The head can form hydrogen bonds
but the tail cannot Scientists call a molecule with a positively or negatively charged area and an uncharged or
nonpolar area amphiphilic or dualloving
