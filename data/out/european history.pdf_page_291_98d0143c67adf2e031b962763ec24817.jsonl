Nations without Nationalism
In an early modern world characterised by some as one of nations without 
nationalism the case of the Spanish monarchy deserves particular attention 
It was the result of a latemedieval dynastic union and other aggregations
some peaceful some violentduring the second half of the sixteenth century 
a composite of heterogeneous territories in Europe the Iberian Peninsula 
the largest islands of the central and western Mediterranean Lombardy 
and Naples in Italy the FrancheComt of Burgundy and the Southern 
Netherlands Africa America and even fareast Asia Various forms of identity 
articulation within the Spanish monarchy converged to what some defined 
as a New Rome Despite the use of various languages currencies and legal 
systems territories possessed by the King of Spain converged around shared 
political religious and cultural identity markers An example of this was the 
conception of the nation as a sum of people beyond merely ethnic or linguistic 
components Thus the use of the Spanish nation to identify the natives of 
ancient Roman Hispania could be articulated sidebyside with ideas of other 
nations which since the Middle Ages had spread over the Iberian Peninsula 
and its adjacent islands Castilian Aragonese Catalan Portuguese Valencian 
or Galician for example These nations were territorially based but socially or 
culturally ambiguous They themselves were the sum of certain homelands 
or republics urban or rural linked to each other on the basis of the right or 
privilege that they would receive from their sovereigns
In the Russian Empire by contrast it makes little sense to talk of nations 
and nationalism before 1800 When the rulers of early modern Russia 
expansionist as they were spoke of the narod people they usually meant 
everyone inhabiting their lands Loyalty to the tsar was the common ground 
rather than religious linguistic or ethnic traits Russian imperial rule came 
with plenty of hierarchies and discriminations based on socioeconomic status 
religion and genderwhile ethnicity and nationality were rarely even 
recorded before the late nineteenth century Early modern Russian leaders 
would frame the Russian Orthodox Church as the only legitimate successor 
to the Byzantine Church and hail Moscow as the Third Rome reflecting 
a broader penchant for aggressive Christian rhetoric And yet this rhetoric 
neither precluded pragmatic accommodation on the ground nor did it mean 
that the tsars wanted their subjects to be more Russian As Moscow and later St 
Petersburg appropriated ever more neighbouring territories the diversity of 
the population grew which turned the selective promotion of difference into 
a pillar of imperial policy
Still protonationalisms were in evidence around Europe during the 
early modern period There was an acknowledgement of cultural differences
