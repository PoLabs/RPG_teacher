to dominion of the American lands In 15501551 the Dominican friar and 
Bishop of Chiapas Mexico Bartolom de las Casas 14841566 held a famous 
debate in Valladolid Spain with the rival theologian Juan Gins de Seplveda 
14941573 about the nature of the Indians Seplveda notably pointed to 
Aristotelian writings to defend the idea of the natural servitude or slavery 
of Amerindians and to underline their inferiority Las Casas argued for their 
human nature and highlighted their capacity for rational thought While legal 
concepts and regulations governing the rights and treatment of Amerindians 
grew more sophisticated abuses continued to take place throughout the 
period along with continuously evolving forms of exploitation
Slavery known to Europe at least since antiquity and to different degrees 
present in many regions of the world reached its frightful apex during the 
early modern era with the transatlantic trade of enslaved Africans Reaching 
its highest intensity during the eighteenth century and continuing well 
into the nineteenth the forced migration of Africans to the Americas and 
the Caribbean did not only change the demography of these regions it 
also provided the backdrop for the systematic development of racism and 
discrimination on the basis of skin colour It is here that modern categories 
of black and white had their origins The initial decision to ship African 
labour to the Americas however had much less to do with perceived racial 
inferiority than the realisation that Africans were more resistant to New World 
diseases than Europeans while also having immunity to Old World illnesses 
such as smallpox Slave owners also considered Africans better suited to the 
labour regime of plantations on the basis of agricultural practices that were 
prevalent in the latters home communities
Conclusion
In the early modern period European awareness of other parts of the globe 
their geography inhabitants flora and fauna expanded massively In trying to 
make sense of these discoveries Europeans could draw on a significant body 
of knowledge about the world contained in the Bible as well as the writings of 
ancient philosophers such as Aristotle and Pliny Thus the militarily successful 
Ottoman Turks could be equated to the Biblical Gog and Magog who hailed 
the end of the world while indigenous peoples of the Americas could be 
approached as representatives of the Golden Age of which the Roman poets 
had dreamed But attempts to understand new human communities using 
the frameworks provided by these texts enabled Europeans to assemble the 
other into their preexisting worldviews They also provided Europeans with 
a means for structuring relations with these new places and peoples including 
the need to justify the exercise of power over them
