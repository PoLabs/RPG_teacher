proteins Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes The recombinant DNA may need to
move into a different vector or host that is better designed for gene expression Scientists may also engineer
plasmids to express proteins only when certain environmental factors stimulate them so they can control the
recombinant proteins expression
Figure 177 This diagram shows the steps involved in molecular cloning
You are working in a molecular biology lab and unbeknownst to you your lab partner left the foreign
genomic DNA that you are planning to clone on the lab bench overnight instead of storing it in the freezer
As a result it was degraded by nucleases but still used in the experiment The plasmid on the other hand
is fine What results would you expect from your molecular cloning experiment
a
There will be no colonies on the bacterial plate
b
There will be blue colonies only
c
There will be blue and white colonies
d
The will be white colonies only
