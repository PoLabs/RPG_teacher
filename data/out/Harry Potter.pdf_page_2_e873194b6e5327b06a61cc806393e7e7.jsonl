because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the
walls Little tyke chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house He got
into his car and backed out of number fours drive
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
something peculiar  a cat reading a map For a second Mr Dursley
didnt realize what he had seen  then he jerked his head around to
look again There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet
Drive but there wasnt a map in sight What could he have been thinking
of It must have been a trick of the light Mr Dursley blinked and
stared at the cat It stared back As Mr Dursley drove around the
corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror It was now
reading the sign that said Privet Drive  no looking at the sign cats
couldnt read maps or signs Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and
put the cat out of his mind As he drove toward town he thought of
nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day
But on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something
else As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help
noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
about People in cloaks Mr Dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in
funny clothes  the getups you saw on young people He supposed this
was some stupid new fashion He drummed his fingers on the steering
wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite
close by They were whispering excitedly together Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man
had to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak The
nerve of him But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some
silly stunt  these people were obviously collecting for something
yes that would be it The traffic moved on and a few minutes later Mr
Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills
Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor If he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate
on drills that morning He didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad
daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed
open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead Most of them had never
seen an owl even at nighttime Mr Dursley however had a perfectly
normal owlfree morning He yelled at five different people He made
several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more He was in a
very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs
and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery
