Conclusion
In the twentieth century European societies experienced a fundamental 
shift in how generations related to each other and particularly how younger 
generations expressed themselves through fashion music and their use of 
leisure time The postwar economic and baby booms accompanied by the 
democratisation of education and the expansion of consumer culture enabled 
the rise of distinct youth cultures in the 1950s For the first time youth 
cultures managed to transcend class and gender lines to a certain extent All 
of these dynamics extended well into the 1960s and 1970s a period in which 
European societies also witnessed the Cold War dtente and the rise of post
materialist values This constellation gave rise to distinctly political sub and 
countercultures each with their own deeply ambivalent relationship to 
consumerism and generationality The 1990s then saw the emergence of neo
tribal subcultures ranging from ravers to young men provocatively displaying 
fascist symbols All of these developments hint at the intimate relationship 
between media consumerism and youth With the rise of the Internet new 
global and local youth cultures have emerged presenting an line of inquiry for 
future discussion of this topic
