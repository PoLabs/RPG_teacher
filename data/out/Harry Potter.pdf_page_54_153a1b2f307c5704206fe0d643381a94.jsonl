Always wanted to shake your hand  Im all of a flutter
Delighted Mr Potter just cant tell you Diggles the name Dedalus
Diggle
Ive seen you before said Harry as Dedalus Diggles top hat fell off
in his excitement You bowed to me once in a shop
He remembers cried Dedalus Diggle looking around at everyone Did
you hear that He remembers me Harry shook hands again and again 
Doris Crockford kept coming back for more
A pale young man made his way forward very nervously One of his eyes
was twitching
Professor Quirrell said Hagrid Harry Professor Quirrell will be
one of your teachers at Hogwarts
PPPotter stammered Professor Quirrell grasping Harrys hand
ccant ttell you how p pleased I am to meet you
What sort of magic do you teach Professor Quirrell
DDefense Against the DDDark Arts muttered Professor Quirrell as
though hed rather not think about it Nnot that you nneed it eh
PPPotter He laughed nervously Youll be ggetting all your
equipment I suppose Ive ggot to ppick up a new bbook on vampires
mmyself He looked terrified at the very thought
But the others wouldnt let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself It
took almost ten minutes to get away from them all At last Hagrid
managed to make himself heard over the babble
Must get on  lots ter buy Come on Harry
Doris Crockford shook Harrys hand one last time and Hagrid led them
through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was
nothing but a trash can and a few weeds
Hagrid grinned at Harry
Told yeh didnt I Told yeh you was famous Even Professor Quirrell
