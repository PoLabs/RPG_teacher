All animals in this class are carnivorous predators and have beaklike jaws in addition to the radula Cephalopods
include the most intelligent of the mollusks and have a welldeveloped nervous system along with imageforming
eyes Unlike other mollusks they have a closed circulatory system in which the blood is entirely contained in
vessels rather than in a hemocoel
The foot is lobed and subdivided into arms and tentacles Suckers with chitinized rings are present on the arms
and tentacles of octopuses and squid Siphons are well developed and the expulsion of water is used as their
primary mode of locomotion which resembles jet propulsion Gills ctenidia are attached to the wall of the
mantle cavity and are serviced by large blood vessels each with its own heart A pair of nephridia is present
within the mantle cavity for water balance and excretion of nitrogenous wastes Cephalopods such as squids
and octopuses also produce sepia or a dark ink which contains melanin The ink gland is located between the
gills and can be released into the excurrent water stream Ink clouds can be used either as a smoke screen to
hide the animal from predators during a quick attempt at escape or to create a fake image to distract predators
Cephalopods are dioecious Members of a species mate and the female then lays the eggs in a secluded and
protected niche Females of some species care for the eggs for an extended period of time and may end up
dying during that time period While most other aquatic mollusks produce trochophore larvae cephalopod eggs
develop directly into a juvenile without an intervening larval stage

Members of class Scaphopoda boat feet are known colloquially as tusk shells or tooth shells as evident
when examining Dentalium one of the few remaining scaphopod genera Figure 2828 Scaphopods are
usually buried in sand with the anterior opening exposed to water These animals have a single conical shell
which is open on both ends The head is not well developed but the mouth containing a radula opens among
a group of tentacles that terminate in ciliated bulbs used to catch and manipulate prey Scaphopods also have a
foot similar to that seen in bivalves Ctenidia are absent in these animals the mantle cavity forms a tube open at
both ends and serves as the respiratory structure in these animals
