Activation Energy
There is another important concept that we must consider regarding endergonic and exergonic reactions Even
exergonic reactions require a small amount of energy input before they can proceed with their energyreleasing
steps These reactions have a net release of energy but still require some initial energy Scientists call this small
amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur the activation energy or free energy of
activation abbreviated as EA Figure 610
Why would an energyreleasing negative G reaction actually require some energy to proceed The reason
lies in the steps that take place during a chemical reaction During chemical reactions certain chemical bonds
break and new ones form For example when a glucose molecule breaks down bonds between the molecules
carbon atoms break Since these are energystoring bonds they release energy when broken However to get
them into a state that allows the bonds to break the molecule must be somewhat contorted A small energy
input is required to achieve this contorted state This contorted state is the transition state and it is a high
energy unstable state For this reason reactant molecules do not last long in their transition state but very
quickly proceed to the chemical reactions next steps Free energy diagrams illustrate the energy profiles for a
given reaction Whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic determines whether the products in the diagram
will exist at a lower or higher energy state than both the reactants and the products However regardless of this
measure the transition state of the reaction exists at a higher energy state than the reactants and thus EA is
always positive

From where does the activation energy that chemical reactants require come The activation energys required
source to push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings Heat energy the total bond
energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction speeds up the molecules motion increasing the
frequency and force with which they collide It also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly helping
them reach their transition state For this reason heating a system will cause chemical reactants within that
system to react more frequently Increasing the pressure on a system has the same effect Once reactants have
absorbed enough heat energy from their surroundings to reach the transition state the reaction will proceed
The activation energy of a particular reaction determines the rate at which it will proceed The higher the
activation energy the slower the chemical reaction The example of iron rusting illustrates an inherently slow
reaction This reaction occurs slowly over time because of its high EA Additionally burning many fuels which
is strongly exergonic will take place at a negligible rate unless sufficient heat from a spark overcomes their
activation energy However once they begin to burn the chemical reactions release enough heat to continue the
