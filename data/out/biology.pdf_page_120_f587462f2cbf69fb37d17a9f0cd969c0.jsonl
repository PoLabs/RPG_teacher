Cytotechnologist
Have you ever heard of a medical test called a Pap smear Figure 44 In this test a doctor takes a small
sample of cells from the patients uterine cervix and sends it to a medical lab where a cytotechnologist stains
the cells and examines them for any changes that could indicate cervical cancer or a microbial infection
Cytotechnologists cyto  cell are professionals who study cells via microscopic examinations and other
laboratory tests They are trained to determine which cellular changes are within normal limits and which
are abnormal Their focus is not limited to cervical cells They study cellular specimens that come from all
organs When they notice abnormalities they consult a pathologist a medical doctor who interprets and
diagnoses changes that disease in body tissue and fluids cause
Cytotechnologists play a vital role in saving peoples lives When doctors discover abnormalities early a
patients treatment can begin sooner which usually increases the chances of a successful outcome
Figure 44 These uterine cervix cells viewed through a light microscope are from a Pap smear Normal cells are
on the left The cells on the right are infected with human papillomavirus HPV Notice that the infected cells are
larger Also two of these cells each have two nuclei instead of one the normal number credit modification of

42  Prokaryotic Cells
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Name examples of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms

Compare and contrast prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells

Describe the relative sizes of different cells

Explain why cells must be small
Cells fall into one of two broad categories prokaryotic and eukaryotic We classify only the predominantly single
celled organisms Bacteria and Archaea as prokaryotes pro  before kary  nucleus Animal cells plants
fungi and protists are all eukaryotes eu  true
Components of Prokaryotic Cells
All cells share four common components 1 a plasma membrane an outer covering that separates the cells
interior from its surrounding environment 2 cytoplasm consisting of a jellylike cytosol within the cell in which
there are other cellular components 3 DNA the cells genetic material and 4 ribosomes which synthesize
proteins However prokaryotes differ from eukaryotic cells in several ways
