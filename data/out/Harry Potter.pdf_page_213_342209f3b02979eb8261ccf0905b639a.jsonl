cloak  it mustve been easy once hed got Hagrid drunk I just hope
Dumbledore believes us Firenze might back us up if Bane doesnt stop
him Wheres Dumbledores office
They looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the
right direction They had never been told where Dumbledore lived nor
did they know anyone who had been sent to see him
Well just have to  Harry began but a voice suddenly rang across
the hall
What are you three doing inside
It was Professor McGonagall carrying a large pile of books
We want to see Professor Dumbledore said Hermione rather bravely
Harry and Ron thought
See Professor Dumbledore Professor McGonagall repeated as though
this was a very fishy thing to want to do Why
Harry swallowed  now what
Its sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadnt because
Professor McGonagalls nostrils flared
Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly He
received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for
London at once
Hes gone said Harry frantically Now
Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard Potter he has many
demands on his time 
But this is important
Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic
Potter
Look said Harry throwing caution to the winds Professor  its
about the Sorcerers tone
