were not slaves their living conditions were often not that different Many 
indentured servants decided to migrate to escape from poverty or to look for 
new opportunities but a significant number of them were deceived about the 
conditions they were going to find forced to migrate for religious reasons or 
as a punishment for having participated in rebellions or civil wars while some 
were even kidnapped This brings this type of migration closer to others in 
which coercion played a major role 
Europe and its colonies in the New World also played a key role of course 
in what is not only a particularly gruesome example of forced migration 
but most likely the numerically largest global migration in the early modern 
period the deportation of approximately 86 million enslaved Africans to the 
Americas between 1500 and 1800 a relatively small number of about 11000 
Africans were also taken to Europe itself Conditions aboard the vessels 
which carried them were so disastrous that almost one and a half million 
people lost their lives before reaching the Western shores of the Atlantic see 
Figure 1 After Europeans had brought new diseases that killed large parts 
of the indigenous populations of the Americas they established vast sugar 
plantations primarily in Brazil and the Caribbean in which enslaved Africans 
were worked to exhaustion and more often than not death Europeans bought 
and transported these forced labourers to supply plantations with manpower
and it was also Europeans who consumed the sugar produced by slave labour 
While by far the largest numbers of enslaved Africans were transported on 
Portuguese and Britishowned ships the slave trade was such big business 
that it drew in players from all over the European continentif not as active 
participants then at least as investors Moreover since slaves were not simply 
robbed but often bought from African traders the transAtlantic slave trade 
provided a stimulus for exportoriented manufacturing in Europe itself as well 
as the European colonies in Asia Despite rising political agitation against the 
slave trade and the enslavement of Africans from the late eighteenth century 
onwards the trade continued until the midnineteenth century
Conclusion
For Europeans migration was common in the early modern period as they 
migrated within the continent and to other parts of the world They did so for 
a wide array of reasons but usually they migrated in order to improve their 
situation seeking safety and economic opportunities However migration was 
not always voluntary Repressive policies prompted religious minorities
members of various Christian groups Jews and Muslimsto settle elsewhere 
Displacement caused by religious policies as well as displacement caused 
by warfare had wideranging implications for economic cultural and 
intellectual life in the migrants new homes as well as the places they left
