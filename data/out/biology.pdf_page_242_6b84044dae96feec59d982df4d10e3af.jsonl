Photosynthesis at the Grocery Store
Figure 88 Foods that humans consume originate from photosynthesis credit Associao Brasileira de
Supermercados
Major grocery stores in the United States are organized into departments such as dairy meats produce
bread cereals and so forth Each aisle Figure 88 contains hundreds if not thousands of different
products for customers to buy and consume
Although there is a large variety each item ultimately can be linked back to photosynthesis Meats and dairy
link because the animals were fed plantbased foods The breads cereals and pastas come largely from
starchy grains which are the seeds of photosynthesisdependent plants What about desserts and drinks
All of these products contain sugarsucrose is a plant product a disaccharide a carbohydrate molecule
which is built directly from photosynthesis Moreover many items are less obviously derived from plants
For instance paper goods are generally plant products and many plastics abundant as products and
packaging are derived from algae unicellular plantlike organisms and cyanobacteria Virtually every
spice and flavoring in the spice aisle was produced by a plant as a leaf root bark flower fruit or stem
Ultimately photosynthesis connects to every meal and every food a person consumes
82  The LightDependent Reactions of
Photosynthesis
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how plants absorb energy from sunlight

Describe short and long wavelengths of light

Describe how and where photosynthesis takes place within a plant
How can light energy be used to make food When a person turns on a lamp electrical energy becomes light
energy Like all other forms of kinetic energy light can travel change form and be harnessed to do work In the
case of photosynthesis light energy is converted into chemical energy which photoautotrophs use to build basic
carbohydrate molecules Figure 89 However autotrophs only use a few specific wavelengths of sunlight
