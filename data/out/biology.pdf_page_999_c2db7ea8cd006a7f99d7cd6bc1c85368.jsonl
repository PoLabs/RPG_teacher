Figure 3220 The structures of dicot and monocot seeds are shown Dicots left have two cotyledons Monocots
such as corn right have one cotyledon called the scutellum it channels nutrition to the growing embryo Both
monocot and dicot embryos have a plumule that forms the leaves a hypocotyl that forms the stem and a radicle
that forms the root The embryonic axis comprises everything between the plumule and the radicle not including
the cotyledons
What of the following statements is true
a
Both monocots and dicots have an endosperm
b
The radicle develops into the root
c
The plumule is part of the epicotyl
d
The endosperm is part of the embryo
The storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots In monocots such as
corn and wheat the single cotyledon is called a scutellum the scutellum is connected directly to the embryo
via vascular tissue xylem and phloem Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm Upon germination
enzymes are secreted by the aleurone a single layer of cells just inside the seed coat that surrounds the
endosperm and embryo The enzymes degrade the stored carbohydrates proteins and lipids the products
of which are absorbed by the scutellum and transported via a vasculature strand to the developing embryo
Therefore the scutellum can be seen to be an absorptive organ not a storage organ
The two cotyledons in the dicot seed also have vascular connections to the embryo In endospermic dicots the
food reserves are stored in the endosperm During germination the two cotyledons therefore act as absorptive
organs to take up the enzymatically released food reserves much like in monocots monocots by definition
also have endospermic seeds Tobacco Nicotiana tabaccum tomato Solanum lycopersicum and pepper
Capsicum annuum are examples of endospermic dicots In nonendospermic dicots the triploid endosperm
develops normally following double fertilization but the endosperm food reserves are quickly remobilized and
moved into the developing cotyledon for storage The two halves of a peanut seed Arachis hypogaea and the
split peas Pisum sativum of split pea soup are individual cotyledons loaded with food reserves
The seed along with the ovule is protected by a seed coat that is formed from the integuments of the ovule sac
In dicots the seed coat is further divided into an outer coat known as the testa and inner coat known as the
tegmen
The embryonic axis consists of three parts the plumule the radicle and the hypocotyl The portion of the embryo
between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl hypocotyl means below the
cotyledons The embryonic axis terminates in a radicle the embryonic root which is the region from which the
root will develop In dicots the hypocotyls extend above ground giving rise to the stem of the plant In monocots
the hypocotyl does not show above ground because monocots do not exhibit stem elongation The part of the
embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl The plumule is composed of the
epicotyl young leaves and the shoot apical meristem
Upon germination in dicot seeds the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards This
shape is called the plumule hook and it persists as long as germination proceeds in the dark Therefore as the
