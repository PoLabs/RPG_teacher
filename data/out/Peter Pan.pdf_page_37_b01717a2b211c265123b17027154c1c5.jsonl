Chapter VI
THE LITTLE HOUSE
Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendys body
when the other boys sprang armed from their trees
You are too late he cried proudly I have shot the Wendy Peter
will be so pleased with me
Overhead Tinker Bell shouted Silly ass and darted into hiding
The others did not hear her They had crowded round Wendy and as
they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood If Wendys heart
had been beating they would all have heard it
Slightly was the first to speak This is no bird he said in a
scared voice I think this must be a lady
A lady said Tootles and fell atrembling
And we have killed her Nibs said hoarsely
They all whipped off their caps
Now I see Curly said Peter was bringing her to us He threw
himself sorrowfully on the ground
A lady to take care of us at last said one of the twins and you
have killed her
They were sorry for him but sorrier for themselves and when he
took a step nearer them they turned from him
Tootles face was very white but there was a dignity about him
now that had never been there before
I did it he said reflecting When ladies used to come to me in
dreams I said Pretty mother pretty mother But when at last she
really came I shot her
He moved slowly away
Dont go they called in pity
I must he answered shaking I am so afraid of Peter
It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made
the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth They heard Peter
crow
Peter they cried for it was always thus that he signalled his
return
Hide her they whispered and gathered hastily around Wendy
But Tootles stood aloof
Again came that ringing crow and Peter dropped in front of them
Greetings boys he cried and mechanically they saluted and then
again was silence
He frowned
I am back he said hotly why do you not cheer
