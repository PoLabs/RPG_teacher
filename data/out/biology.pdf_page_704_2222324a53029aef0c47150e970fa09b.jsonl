Discuss the role of fungi as model organisms
Although we often think of fungi as organisms that cause disease and rot food they are vitally important to
human life on many levels As we have seen fungi influence the wellbeing of human populations on a large
scale because they are part of the nutrient cycle in ecosystems They have other ecosystem roles as well As
animal pathogens fungi help to control the population of damaging pests These fungi are very specific to the
insects they attack and do not infect animals or plants Fungi are currently under investigation as potential
microbial insecticides with several already on the market For example the fungus Beauveria bassiana is being
tested as a possible biological control agent for the recent spread of emerald ash borer a beetle that feeds on
ash trees It has been released in Michigan Illinois Indiana Ohio West Virginia and Maryland Figure 2428
Figure 2428 Fungal insect control The emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis is an insect that attacks ash trees It
is in turn parasitized by a pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana that holds promise as a biological insecticide The
parasitic fungus appears as white fuzz on the body of the insect credit Houping Liu USDA Agricultural Research

The mycorrhizal relationship between fungi and plant roots is essential for the productivity of farm land Without
the fungal partner in root systems 8090 percent of trees and grasses would not survive Mycorrhizal fungal
inoculants are available as soil amendments from gardening supply stores and are promoted by supporters of
organic agriculture
We also eat some types of fungi Mushrooms figure prominently in the human diet Morels shiitake mushrooms
chanterelles and truffles are considered delicacies Figure 2429 The humble meadow mushroom Agaricus
campestris appears in many dishes Molds of the genus Penicillium ripen many cheeses They originate in the
natural environment such as the caves of Roquefort France where wheels of sheep milk cheese are stacked in
order to capture the molds responsible for the blue veins and pungent taste of the cheese
