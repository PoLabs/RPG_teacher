41 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE

represented approximately half of the total European capacity Later on British 
shipwrights adopted and improved the original design in turn enabling the 
expansion of the British Atlantic trade
Sometimes the state played a central role in infrastructural development 
and technological change especially from the rise of absolute monarchies In 
the midseventeenth century Europe witnessed a turn from private initiative 
towards designs and efforts orchestrated by the state An early example is the 
systematic development and standardisation of postal services which started 
at the beginning of the sixteenth century Networks of horseriding couriers for 
regular diplomatic communication across the large European kingdoms and 
empires appeared The Habsburg monarchy spanning an area that stretched 
from the Atlantic coast to the borders of the Ottoman Empire played a leading 
role establishing the Imperial Post to connect the main centres of the empire 
When this network also started to provide services to nonstate customers 
cities such as Venice connected themselves to it as well
With traffic levels gradually increasing in the eighteenth century European 
states started to develop an interest in improving roads and waterways either 
by stimulating private investment the British turnpike roads or by building 
national road networks on the continent 
The development in postal services using the improving road networks 
and in shipbuilding which supplied global trade networks significantly 
contributed to the intensification of communication both within Europe and 
between Europe and the wider world They thereby also contributed to the 
formation of Europe as a selfaware cultural and economic unit
Migrating Craftsmen and the Diffusion of Innovations
Who used the new technologies and scientific advances that appeared in early 
modern Europe The question about the users and consumers of knowledge 
and technology is significant because the invention of a device would be 
meaningless without its subsequent use and further development This is 
just as true for the invention of the printing press as it is for the invention of 
the mechanical pocket watch 1510 the microscope 1608 the steam engine 
1712 and the loom 1764 The people who used these devices were scholars 
artisans craftsmen engineers and entrepreneurs among others In the early 
modern period ever more people took up these professions This mirrored an 
increasing social complexity between 1500 and 1800 
The boundaries between those who advanced science and technological 
change and those who used these achievements were fluid A significant 
example to study the persona of the innovatoruser is that of migrating 
craftsmen It was a fundamental part of the training of every carpenter
