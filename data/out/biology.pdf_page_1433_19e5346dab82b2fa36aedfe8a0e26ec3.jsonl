Its easy to get lost in the discussion about why dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago Was it due to a
meteor slamming into Earth near the coast of modernday Mexico or was it from some longterm weather
cycle that is not yet understood Scientists are continually exploring these and other theories
Woolly mammoths began to go extinct much more recently when they shared the Earth with humans who
were no different anatomically than humans today Figure 4512 Mammoths survived in isolated island
populations as recently as 1700 BC We know a lot about these animals from carcasses found frozen in the
ice of Siberia and other regions of the north Scientists have sequenced at least 50 percent of its genome
and believe mammoths are between 98 and 99 percent identical to modern elephants
It is commonly thought that climate change and human hunting led to their extinction A 2008 study
estimated that climate change reduced the mammoths range from 3000000 square miles 42000 years
ago to 310000 square miles 6000 years ago

It is also well documented that humans hunted these
animals A 2012 study showed that no single factor was exclusively responsible for the extinction of these
magnificent creatures

In addition to human hunting climate change and reduction of habitat these
scientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoths extinction was the migration of humans
across the Bering Strait to North America during the last ice age 20000 years ago
The maintenance of stable populations was and is very complex with many interacting factors determining
the outcome It is important to remember that humans are also part of nature We once contributed to a
species decline using only primitive hunting technology
Life Histories of Kselected and rselected Species
While reproductive strategies play a key role in life histories they do not account for important factors like limited
resources and competition The regulation of population growth by these factors can be used to introduce a
classical concept in population biology that of Kselected versus rselected species
The concept relates to a species reproductive strategies habitat and behavior especially in the way that
they obtain resources and care for their young It includes length of life and survivorship factors as well
Population biologists have grouped species into the two large categoriesKselected and rselectedalthough
the categories are really two ends of a continuum
Kselected species are species selected by stable predictable environments Populations of Kselected
species tend to exist close to their carrying capacity hence the term Kselected where intraspecific competition
is high These species have few large offspring a long gestation period and often give longterm care to their
offspring Table 452 While larger in size when born the offspring are relatively helpless and immature at birth
