military capacities was counterbalanced by the economic successes of the 
region 
This tradeoff is evident in the cases of neighbouring countries and 
provinces While some could benefit from the freetrade agreements around 
the Common Market others were enlisted in the satellite state system 
surrounding the Soviet Union The lands that make up todays Czechia were 
the most developed territories of the Habsburg Monarchy on par with Austria 
and Bavaria But only Austria and Bavaria were beneficiaries of the Marshall 
Plan Two generations seventy years later Czechia was clearly lagging 
behind its neighbours 
As for Czechoslovakia the GDR the capitals of which were to the west 
of Vienna and the rest of Eastern Europe power relations were simple The 
military dominance of the Soviet Union that took shape in the form of the 
Warsaw Pact was practically an occupation the governments of countries 
hosting the troops of the Red Army were not even informed of basic facts 
such as whether or not nuclear heads were stationed on their territories As 
for economic relations the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance CMEA or 
Comecon was not mutual in the sense of multilateralism In fact throughout 
its existence it was based on bilateral agreements In the framework of the 
pact the Soviet Union was importing value added in the form of processed or 
manufactured goods while exporting raw materials first and foremost crude 
oil and natural gas Economic relations were subordinated to defence purposes 
and were not efficient The central power of the system the USSR exploited 
its satellite statesand itself too On the macro level no country became rich 
at the cost of the others Rather it was a situation where huge human effort 
became useless waste This is why at the end of the twentieth century the 
system of Pax Sovietica collapsed under its own weight 
This economic and political division of Europe influenced the mental 
maps of ordinary people too The continents prior centre of gravity in the 
northwest was now extending to the Mediterranean The traditional mental 
map of Europe for much of history articulated a difference between the 
north and the Mediterranean south Although this representation is still 
present in everyday life for example the topos of the industrious people of 
the north going on holiday to the south where they feel their money can 
buy more and people know how to live This image was overwritten for 
long decades by the westeast split where the visit behind the Iron Curtain 
was considered to be an exotic adventure as if visiting Prague a city that is 
more westerly than Vienna would have been nearly equal to an expedition 
to Siberia On the other hand those everyday people who were living behind 
the Iron Curtain acknowledged their underdog positionlistening to Western
