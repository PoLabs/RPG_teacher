in the middle nothing at all
Have a good term said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile He
left without another word Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away
All three of them were laughing Harrys mouth went rather dry What on
earth was he going to do He was starting to attract a lot of funny
looks because of Hedwig Hed have to ask someone
He stopped a passing guard but didnt dare mention platform nine and
threequarters The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry
couldnt even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to
get annoyed as though Harry was being stupid on purpose Getting
desperate Harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but
the guard said there wasnt one In the end the guard strode away
muttering about time wasters Harry was now trying hard not to panic
According to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes
left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he
was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly
lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like
tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley He
wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket
inspectors stand between platforms nine and ten
At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a
few words of what they were saying
 packed with Muggles of course 
Harry swung round The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four
boys all with flaming red hair Each of them was pushing a trunk like
Harrys in front of him  and they had an owl
Heart hammering Harry pushed his cart after them They stopped and so
did he just near enough to hear what they were saying
Now whats the platform number said the boys mother
Nine and threequarters piped a small girl also redheaded who was
holding her hand Mom cant I go 
Youre not old enough Ginny now be quiet All right Percy you go
