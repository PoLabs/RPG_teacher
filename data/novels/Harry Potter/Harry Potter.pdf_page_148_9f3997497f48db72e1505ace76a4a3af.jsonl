knees werent going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers
Madam Hooch was refereeing She stood in the middle of the field waiting
for the two teams her broom in her hand
Now I want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all
gathered around her Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking
particularly to the Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint a sixth year Harry
thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him Out of the
corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing
Potter for President over the crowd His heart skipped He felt braver
Mount your brooms please
Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle
Fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air They were off And the
Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor  what
an excellent Chaser that girl is and rather attractive too
