Potters been sent a broomstick Professor said Malfoy quickly
Yes yes thats right said Professor Flitwick beaming at Harry
Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances
Potter And what model is it
A Nimbus Two Thousand sit said Harry fighting not to laugh at the
look of horror on Malfoys face And its really thanks to Malfoy here
that Ive got it he added
Harry and Ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at Malfoys
obvious rage and confusion Well its true Harry chortled as they
reached the top of the marble staircase If he hadnt stolen Nevilles
Remembrall I woulnt be on the team
So I suppose you think thats a reward for breaking rules came an
angry voice from just behind them Hermione was stomping up the stairs
looking disapprovingly at the package in Harrys hand
I thought you werent speaking to us said Harry
Yes dont stop now said Ron its doing us so much good
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day It
kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying
under his bed or straying off to the Quidditch field where hed be
learning to play that night He bolted his dinner that evening without
noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap
the Nimbus Two Thousand at last
Wow Ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto Harrys bedspread
Even Harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it
looked wonderful Sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long
tail of neat straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold
near the top
As seven oclock drew nearer Harry left the castle and set off in the
dusk toward the Quidditch field Held never been inside the stadium
before Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that
the spectators were high enough to see what was going on At either end
