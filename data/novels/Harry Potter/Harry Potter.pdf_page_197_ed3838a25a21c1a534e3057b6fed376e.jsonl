walking with a new spring in his step  Quirrell seemed to have given
in at last
Harry went back to the library where Hermione was testing Ron on
Astronomy Harry told them what hed heard
Snapes done it then said Ron If Quirrells told him how to break
his AntiDark Force spell 
Theres still Fluffy though said Hermione
Maybe Snapes found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid
said Ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them I bet
theres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant
threeheaded dog So what do we do Harry
The light of adventure was kindling again in Rons eyes but Hermione
answered before Harry could
Go to Dumbledore Thats what we should have done ages ago If we try
anything ourselves well be thrown out for sure
But weve got no proof said Harry Quirrells too scared to back us
up Snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at
Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor  who do you
think theyll believe him or us Its not exactly a secret we hate him
Dumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked Filch wouldnt help
us if his life depended on it hes too friendly with Snape and the
more students get thrown out the better hell think And dont forget
were not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy Thatll take a lot
of explaining
Hermione looked convinced but Ron didnt
If we just do a bit of poking around 
No said Harry flatly weve done enough poking around
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of
its moons
The following morning notes were delivered to Harry Hermione and
Neville at the breakfast table They were all the same
