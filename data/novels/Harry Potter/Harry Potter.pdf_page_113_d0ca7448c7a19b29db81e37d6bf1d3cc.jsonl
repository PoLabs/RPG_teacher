Investigations continue into the breakin at Gringotts on 31 July
widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken The vault
that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day
But were not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if
you know whats good for you said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this
afternoon
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to
rob Gringotts but Ron hadnt mentioned the date
Hagrid said Harry that Gringotts breakin happened on my birthday
It mightve been happening while we were there
There was no doubt about it Hagrid definitely didnt meet Harrys eyes
this time He grunted and offered him another rock cake Harry read the
story again The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied
earlier that same day Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and
thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little
package Had that been what the thieves were looking for
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets
weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to refuse Harry
thought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much
to think about as tea with Hagrid Had Hagrid collected that package
just in time Where was it now And did Hagrid know something about
Snape that he didnt want to tell Harry
CHAPTER NINE
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley
but that was before he met Draco Malfoy
Still firstyear
Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins so they didnt have to
put up with Malfoy much Or at least they didnt until they spotted a
notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday  and Gryffindor and
Slytherin
would be learning together
