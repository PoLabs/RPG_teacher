Bye said Harry and Ron The twins slid the compartment door shut
behind them
Are you really Harry Potter Ron blurted out
Harry nodded
Oh well I thought it might be one of Fred and Georges jokes said
Ron And have you really got  you know
He pointed at Harrys forehead
Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar Ron stared
So thats where YouKnowWho
Yes said Harry but I cant remember it
Nothing said Ron eagerly
Well  I remember a lot of green light but nothing else
Wow said Ron He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments then as
though he had suddenly realized what he was doing he looked quickly out
of the window again
Are all your family wizards asked Harry who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him
Er  Yes I think so said Ron I think Moms got a second cousin
whos an accountant but we never talk about him
So you must know loads of magic already
The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale
boy in Diagon Alley had talked about
I heard you went to live with Muggles said Ron What are they like
Horrible well not all of them My aunt and uncle and cousin are
though Wish Id had three wizard brothers
