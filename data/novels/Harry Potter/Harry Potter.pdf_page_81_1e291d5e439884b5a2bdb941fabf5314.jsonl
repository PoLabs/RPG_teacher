What are these Harry asked Ron holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs
Theyre not really frogs are they He was starting to feel that
nothing would surprise him
No said Ron But see what the card is Im missing Agrippa

Oh of course you wouldnt know  Chocolate Frogs have cards inside
them you know to collect  famous witches and wizards Ive got about
five hundred but I havent got Agrippa or Ptolemy
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card It showed a
mans face He wore half moon glasses had a long crooked nose and
flowing silver hair beard and mustache Underneath the picture was the
name Albus Dumbledore
So this is Dumbledore said Harry
Dont tell me youd never heard of Dumbledore said Ron Can I have a
frog I might get Agrippa  thanks
Harry turned over his card and read
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in
1945 for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his
work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel Professor Dumbledore

Harry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that
Dumbledores face had disappeared
Hes gone
