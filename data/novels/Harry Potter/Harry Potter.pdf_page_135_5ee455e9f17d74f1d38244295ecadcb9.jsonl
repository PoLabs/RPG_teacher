Seeker Thats you And you dont have to worry about the Quaffle or the
Bludgers unless they crack my head open
Dont worry the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers  I
mean theyre like a pair of human Bludgers themselves
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball
Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers it was tiny about the size
of a large walnut It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver
wings
This said Wood is the Golden Snitch and its the most important
ball of the lot Its very hard to catch because its so fast and
difficult to see Its the Seekers job to catch it Youve got to weave
in and out of the Chasers Beaters Bludgers and Quaffle to get it
before the other teams Seeker because whichever Seeker catches the
Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they
nearly always win Thats why Seekers get fouled so much A game of
Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught so it can go on for ages
 I think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on
substitutes so the players could get some sleep Well thats it  any
questions
Harry shook his head He understood what he had to do all right it was
doing it that was going to be the problem
We wont practice with the Snitch yet said Wood carefully shutting
it back inside the crate its too dark we might lose it Lets try
you out with a few of these
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few
minutes later he and Harry were up in the air Wood throwing the golf
balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch
Harry didnt miss a single one and Wood was delighted After half an
hour night had really fallen and they couldnt carry on
That Quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said Wood happily
as they trudged back up to the castle I wouldnt be surprised if you
turn out better than Charlie Weasley and he could have played for
England if he hadnt gone off chasing dragons
