and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before She let Harry watch
television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though
shed had it for several years
That evening Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in
his brandnew uniform Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange
knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters They also carried
knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent
looking This was supposed to be good training for later life
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers Uncle Vernon said
gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life Aunt Petunia burst
into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins he
looked so handsome and grownup Harry didnt trust himself to speak He
thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to
laugh
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry
went in for breakfast It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in
the sink He went to have a look The tub was full of what looked like
dirty rags swimming in gray water
Whats this he asked Aunt Petunia Her lips tightened as they always
did if he dared to ask a question
Your new school uniform she said
Harry looked in the bowl again
Oh he said I didnt realize it had to be so wet
DotA be stupid snapped Aunt Petunia Im dyeing some of Dudleys old
things gray for you Itll look just like everyone elses when Ive
finished
Harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue He sat
down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look
on his first day at Stonewall High  like he was wearing bits of old
elephant skin probably
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the
smell from Harrys new uniform Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as
usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick which he carried everywhere
