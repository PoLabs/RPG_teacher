though the teddy was having his head torn off
Byebye Norbert Hagrid sobbed as Harry and Hermione covered the
crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves
Mommy will never forget you
How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never
knew Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble
staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors UP another
staircase then another  even one of Harrys shortcuts didnt make the
work much easier
Nearly there Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the
tallest tower
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate
Forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the
shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each
other ten feet away A lamp flared
Professor McGonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had Malfoy by
the ear
Detention she shouted And twenty points from Slytherin Wandering
around in the middle of the night how dare you 
You dont understand Professor Harry Potters coming  hes got a
dragon
What utter rubbish How dare you tell such lies Come on  I shall see
Professor Snape about you Malfoy
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest
thing in the world after that Not until theyd stepped out into the
cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe
properly again Hermione did a sort of jig
Malfoys got detention I could sing
Dont Harry advised her
Chuckling about Malfoy they waited Norbert thrashing about in his
crate About ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out
