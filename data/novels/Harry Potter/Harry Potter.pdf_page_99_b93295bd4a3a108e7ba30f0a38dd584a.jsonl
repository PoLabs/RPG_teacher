I havent eaten for nearly four hundred years said the ghost I dont
need to of course but one does miss it I dont think Ive in troduced
myself Sir Nicholas de MimsyPorpington at your service Resident ghost
of Gryffindor Tower
I know who you are said Ron suddenly My brothers told me about you
 youre Nearly Headless Nick
I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy  the ghost began
stiffly but sandyhaired Seamus Finnigan interrupted
Nearly Headless How can you be nearly headless
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasnt
going at all the way he wanted
Like this he said irritably He seized his left ear and pulled His
whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on
a hinge Someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it
properly Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces Nearly
Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said
So  new Gryffindors I hope youre going to help us win the house
championship this year Gryffindors have never gone so long without
winning Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row The Bloody
Barons becoming almost unbearable  hes the Slytherin ghost
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost
sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained
with silver blood He was right next to Malfoy who Harry was pleased to
see didnt look too pleased with the seating arrangements
How did he get covered in blood asked Seamus with great interest
Ive never asked said Nearly Headless Nick delicately
When everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food
faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before A moment
later the desserts appeared Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you
could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam
doughnuts trifle strawberries JellO rice pudding  
As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their
families
