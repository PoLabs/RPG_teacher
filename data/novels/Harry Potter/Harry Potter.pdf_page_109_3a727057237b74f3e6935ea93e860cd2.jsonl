hands Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class His
eyes were black like Hagrids but they had none of Hagrids warmth
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels
You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of
potionmaking he began He spoke in barely more than a whisper but
they caught every word  like Professor McGonagall Snape had y caught
every word  like Professor McGonagall Snape had the gift of keeping a
class silent without effort As there is little foolish wandwaving
here many of you will hardly believe this is magic I dont expect you
will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with
its shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through
human veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses I can teach
you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death  if you arent
as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach
More silence followed this little speech Harry and Ron exchanged looks
with raised eyebrows Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and
looked desperate to start proving that she wasnt a dunderhead
Potter said Snape suddenly What would I get if I added powdered
root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what Harry glanced at Ron who
looked as stumped as he was Hermiones hand had shot into the air
I dont know sit said Harry
Snapes lips curled into a sneer
Tut tut  fame clearly isnt everything
He ignored Hermiones hand
Lets try again Potter where would you look if I told you to find me
a bezoar
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without
her leaving her seat but Harry didnt have the faintest idea what a
bezoar was He tried not to look at Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle who were
shaking with laughter
I dont know sit Thought you wouldnt open a book before coming
