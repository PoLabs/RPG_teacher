See you in a minute I hope
And Harry let go Cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down
down and  FLUMP With a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on
something soft He sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the
gloom It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant
Its okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp
which was the open trapdoor its a soft landing you can jump
Ron followed right away He landed sprawled next to Harry
Whats this stuff were his first words
Dunno some sort of plant thing I suppose its here to break the fall
Come on Hermione
The distant music stopped There was a loud bark from the dog but
Hermione had already jumped She landed on Harrys other side
We must be miles under the school  she said
Lucky this plant things here really said Ron
Lucky shrieked Hermione Look at you both
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist
snakelike tendrils around her ankles As for Harry and Ron their legs
had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant
off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster
the plant wound around them
Stop moving Hermione ordered them I know what this is  its
Devils Snare
Oh Im so glad we know what its called thats a great help snarled
Ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his
neck Shut up Im trying to remember how to kill it said Hermione
