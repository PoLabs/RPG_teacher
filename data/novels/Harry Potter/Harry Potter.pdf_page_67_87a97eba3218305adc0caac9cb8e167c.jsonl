clapped and Mr Ollivander cried Oh bravo Yes indeed oh very
good Well well well how curious how very curious 
He put Harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper
still muttering Curious curious
Sorry said Harry but whats curious
Mr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare
I remember every wand Ive ever sold Mr Potter Every single wand It
so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave
another feather  just one other It is very curious indeed that you
should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave
you that scar
Harry swallowed
Yes thirteenandahalf inches Yew Curious indeed how these things
happen The wand chooses the wizard remember I think we must expect
great things from you Mr Potter After all He
WhoMustNotBeNamed did great things  terrible yes but great
Harry shivered He wasnt sure he liked Mr Ollivander too much He paid
seven gold Galleons for his wand and Mr Ollivander bowed them from his
shop
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made
their way back down Diagon Alley back through the wall back through
the Leaky Cauldron now empty Harry didnt speak at all as they walked
down the road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at
them on the Underground laden as they were with all their funnyshaped
packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harrys lap Up
another escalator out into Paddington station Harry only realized
where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder
Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said
He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat
them Harry kept looking around Everything looked so strange somehow
You all right Harry Yer very quiet said Hagrid
