Quirrell cursed again
Get out of the way he said As Harry moved aside he felt the
Sorcerers Stone against his leg Dare he make a break for it
But he hadnt walked five paces before a high voice spoke though
Quirrell wasnt moving his lips
He lies He lies
Potter come back here Quirrell shouted Tell me the truth What did
you just see
The high voice spoke again
Let me speak to him facetoface
Master you are not strong enough
I have strength enough for this
Harry felt as if Devils Snare was rooting him to the spot He couldnt
move a muscle Petrified he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to
unwrap his turban What was going on The turban fell away Quirrells
head looked strangely small without it Then he turned slowly on the
spot
Harry would have screamed but he couldnt make a sound Where there
should have been a back to Quirrells head there was a face the most
terrible face Harry had ever seen It was chalk white with glaring red
eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake
Harry Potter it whispered
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldnt move
See what I have become the face said Mere shadow and vapor  I
have form only when I can share anothers body but there have always
been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds Unicorn
blood has strengthened me these past weeks you saw faithful Quirrell
drinking it for me in the forest and once I have the Elixir of Life
I will be able to create a body of my own Now why dont you give
