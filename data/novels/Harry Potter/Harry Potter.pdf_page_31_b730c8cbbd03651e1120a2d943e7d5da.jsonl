letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets The Dursleys
ducked but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one
Out OUT
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall
When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their
faces Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut They could hear the letters
still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floor
That does it said Uncle Vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling

boardedup doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway
Dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the

computer in his sports bag
They drove And they drove Even Aunt Petunia didnt dare ask where they
were going Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and
drive in the opposite direction for a while Shakeem off shake em
off he would mutter whenever he did this
They didnt stop to eat or drink all day By nightfall Dudley was
howling Hed never had such a bad day in his life He was hungry hed
missed five television programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone
so long without blowing up an alien on his computer
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomylooking hotel on the
outskirts of a big city Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds
and damp musty sheets Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake sitting on
the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and
wondering
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for
breakfast the next day They had just finished when the owner of the
hotel came over to their table
Scuse me but is one of you Mr H Potter Only I got about an undred
