Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry
I want to hear youre training hard Potter or I may change my mind
about punishing you
Then she suddenly smiled
Your father would have been proud she said He was an excellent
Quidditch player himself
Youre joking
It was dinnertime Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened
when hed left the grounds with Professor McGonagall Ron had a piece of
steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but hed forgotten all about
it
Seeker he said But first years never  you must be the youngest
house player in about a century said Harry shoveling pie into his
mouth He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the
afternoon Wood told me
Ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at Harry

hurried over
