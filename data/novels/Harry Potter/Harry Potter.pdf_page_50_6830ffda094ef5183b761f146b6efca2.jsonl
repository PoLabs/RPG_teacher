job Bungler if ever there was one So he pelts Dumbledore with owls
every morning askin fer advice
But what does a Ministry of Magic do
Well their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that theres still
witches an wizards up an down the country

problems Nah were best left alone
At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall Hagrid
folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the
street
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town
to the station Harry couldnt blame them Not only was Hagrid twice as
tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like
parking meters and saying loudly See that Harry Things these Muggles
dream up eh
Hagrid said Harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say
there are dragons at Gringotts
Well so they say said Hagrid Crikey Id like a dragon
Youd like one
Wanted one ever since I was a kid  here we go
They had reached the station There was a train to London in five
minutes time Hagrid who didnt understand Muggle money as he
called it gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets
People stared more than ever on the train Hagrid took up two seats and
sat knitting what looked like a canaryyellow circus tent
Still got yer letter Harry he asked as he counted stitches Harry
took the parchment envelope out of his pocket
