of these at the front desk
She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address
Mr H Potter
Room 17
Railview Hotel
Cokeworth
Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out
of the way The woman stared
Ill take them said Uncle Vernon standing up quickly and following
her from the dining room
Wouldnt it be better just to go home dear Aunt Petunia suggested
timidly hours later but Uncle Vernon didnt seem to hear her Exactly
what he was looking for none of them knew He drove them into the
middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in
the car and off they went again The same thing happened in the middle
of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of
a multilevel parking garage
Daddys gone mad hasnt he Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that
afternoon Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside
the car and disappeared
It started to rain Great drops beat on the roof of the car Dud ley
sniveled
Its Monday he told his mother The Great Humbertos on tonight I
want to stay somewhere with a television 
Monday This reminded Harry of something If it was Monday  and you
could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week because of
television  then tomorrow Tuesday was Harrys eleventh birthday Of
course his birthdays were never exactly fun  last year the Dursleys
had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernons old socks
Still you werent eleven every day
