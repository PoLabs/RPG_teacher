Harry left before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor He
sprinted back upstairs
Did you get it Ron asked as Harry joined them Whats the matter
In a low whisper Harry told them what hed seen
You know what this means he finished breathlessly He tried to get
past that threeheaded dog at Halloween Thats where he was going when
we saw him  hes after whatever its guarding And Id bet my
broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion
Hermiones eyes were wide
No  he wouldnt she said I know hes not very nice but he
wouldnt try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe
Honestly Hermione you think all teachers are saints or something
snapped Ron Im with Harry I wouldnt put anything past Snape But
whats he after Whats that dog guarding
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question Neville
was snoring loudly but Harry couldnt sleep He tried to empty his mind
 he needed to sleep he had to he had his first Quidditch match in a
few hours  but the expression on Snapes face when Harry had seen his
leg wasnt easy to forget
The next morning dawned very bright and cold The Great Hall was full of
the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of
everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match
Youve got to eat some breakfast
I dont want anything
Just a bit of toast wheedled Hermione
Im not hungry
Harry felt terrible In an hours time hed be walking onto the field
Harry you need your strength said Seamus Finnigan Seekers are
always the ones who get clobbered by the other team
