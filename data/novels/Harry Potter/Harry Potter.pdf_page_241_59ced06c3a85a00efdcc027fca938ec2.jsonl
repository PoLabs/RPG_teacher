Well Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried
to stop him from killing me But why would he want to kill me in the
first place
Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time
Alas the first thing you ask me I cannot tell you Not today Not
now You will know one day put it from your mind for now Harry
When you are older I know you hate to hear this when you are
ready you will know
And Harry knew it would be no good to argue
But why couldnt Quirrell touch me
Your mother died to save you If there is one thing Voldemort cannot
understand it is love He didnt realize that love as powerful as your
mothers for you leaves its own mark Not a scar no visible sign to
have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone
will give us some protection forever It is in your very skin Quirrell
full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with Voldemort
could not touch you for this reason It was agony to touch a person
marked by something so good
Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill
which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet When he had found
his voice again Harry said And the invisibility cloak  do you know
who sent it to me
Ah  your father happened to leave it in my possession and I thought
you might like it Dumbledores eyes twinkled Useful things your
father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food
when he was here
And theres something else
Fire away
Quirrell said Snape 
Professor Snape Harry Yes him  Quirrell said he hates me because
he hated my father Is that true
