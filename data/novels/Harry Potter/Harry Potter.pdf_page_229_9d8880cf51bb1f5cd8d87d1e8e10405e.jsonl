Snapes said Harry What do we have to do
They stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind
them in the doorway It wasnt ordinary fire either it was purple At
the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward
They were trapped
Look Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles Harry
looked over her shoulder to read it
Danger lies before you while safety lies behind
Two of us will help you which ever you would find
One among us seven will let you move ahead
Another will transport the drinker back instead
Two among our number hold only nettle wine
Three of us are killers waiting bidden in line
Choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore
To help you in your choice we give you these clues four
First however slyly the poison tries to hide
You will always find some on nettle wines left side
Second different are those who stand at either end
But if you would move onward neither is your friend
Third as you see clearly all are different size
Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides
Fourth the second left and the second on the right
Are twins once you taste them though different at first sight
