thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the
letter in the hall Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each
other darkly
When the mail arrived Uncle Vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice
to Harry made Dudley go and get it They heard him banging things with
his Smelting stick all the way down the hall Then he shouted Theres
another one Mr H Potter The Smallest Bedroom 4 Privet Drive 
With a strangled cry Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the
hall Harry right behind him Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the
ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact
that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind After a
minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the
Smelting stick Uncle Vernon straightened up gasping for breath with
Harrys letter clutched in his hand
Go to your cupboard  I mean your bedroom he wheezed at Harry
Dudley  go  just go
Harry walked round and round his new room Someone knew he had moved out
of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first
letter Surely that meant theyd try again And this time hed make sure
they didnt fail He had a plan
The repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning Harry
turned it off quickly and dressed silently He mustnt wake the
Dursleys He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and
get the letters for number four first His heart hammered as he crept
across the dark hall toward the front door 
Harry leapt into the air hed trodden on something big and squashy on
the doormat  something alive
Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the
big squashy something had been his uncles face Uncle Vernon had been
lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making
sure that Harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do He
shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make
a cup of tea Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the
time he got back the mail had arrived right into Uncle Vernons lap
