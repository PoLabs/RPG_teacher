Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas What did you talk to him
about Hagrid Did you mention Hogwarts at all

He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after so I told
him an I said what Id always really wanted was a dragon an
then I can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinks
Lets see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play
cards fer it if I wanted but he had ter be sure I could handle it he
didn want it ter go ter any old home So I told him after Fluffy a
dragon would be easy

to keep his voice calm
Well  yeah  how many threeheaded dogs dyeh meet even around

Hagrid suddenly looked horrified

Harry Ron and Hermione didnt speak to each other at all until they
came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy
after the grounds
Weve got to go to Dumbledore said Harry Hagrid told that stranger
how to get past Fluffy and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that
