Ron started to direct the black pieces They moved silently wherever he
sent them Harrys knees were trembling What if they lost
Harry  move diagonally four squares to the right
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken The white
queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he
lay quite still facedown
Had to let that happen said Ron looking shaken Leaves you free to
take that bishop Hermione go on
Every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy
Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall
Twice Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in
danger He himself darted around the board taking almost as many white
pieces as they had lost black ones
Were nearly there he muttered suddenly Let me think let me
think
The white queen turned her blank face toward him
Yes said Ron softly Its the only way Ive got to be taken
NOF Harry and Hermione shouted
Thats chess snapped Ron Youve got to make some sacrifices I take
one step forward and shell take me  that leaves you free to checkmate
the king Harry
But 
Do you want to stop Snape or not
Ron 
Look if you dont hurry up hell already have the Stone
There was no alternative
Ready Ron called his face pale but determined Here I go  now
