Oh yeah Poor bloke Brilliant mind He was fine while he was
studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand
experience They say he met vampires in the Black Forest and there

Scared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me
umbrella
Vampires Hags Harrys head was swimming Hagrid meanwhile was
counting bricks in the wall above the trash can
Three up two across he muttered Right stand back Harry
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella
The brick he had touched quivered  it wriggled  in the middle a
small hole appeared  it grew wider and wider  a second later they
were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid an archway onto a
cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight
Welcome said Hagrid to Diagon Alley
He grinned at Harrys amazement They stepped through the archway Harry
looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly
back into solid wall
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop
Cauldrons  All Sizes  Copper Brass Pewter Silver  SelfStirring
 Collapsible said a sign hanging over them
Yeah youll be needin one said Hagrid but we gotta get yer money
first
Harry wished he had about eight more eyes He turned his head in every
direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at
once the shops the things outside them the people doing their
shopping A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as
they passed saying Dragon liver seventeen Sickles an ounce theyre
mad
