really has gone Dumbledore
It certainly seems so said Dumbledore We have much to be thankful
for Would you care for a lemon drop
A what
A lemon drop Theyre a kind of Muggle sweet Im rather fond of
No thank you said Professor McGonagall coldly as though she didnt
think this was the moment for lemon drops As I say even if
YouKnowWho has gone 
My dear Professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him
by his name All this You KnowWho nonsense  for eleven years I
have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name
Voldemort Professor McGonagall flinched but Dumbledore who was
unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice It all gets so
confusing if we keep saying YouKnowWho I have never seen any reason
to be frightened of saying Voldemorts name
I know you haven t said Professor McGonagall sounding half
exasperated half admiring But youre different Everyone knows youre
the only one YouKnow oh all right Voldemort was frightened of
You flatter me said Dumbledore calmly Voldemort had powers I will
never have
Only because youre too  well  noble to use them
Its lucky its dark I havent blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey
told me she liked my new earmuffs
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said The owls
are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around You know what
everyones saying About why hes disappeared About what finally
stopped him
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most
anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard
wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed
Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now It was plain that
whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until
