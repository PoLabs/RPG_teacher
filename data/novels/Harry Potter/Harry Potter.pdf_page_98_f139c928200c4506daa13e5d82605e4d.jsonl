Well done Ron excellent said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry
as Zabini Blaise was made a Slytherin Professor McGonagall rolled
up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate He had only just realized how
hungry he was The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet He was beaming at the students
his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to
see them all there
Welcome he said Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts Before we begin
our banquet I would like to say a few words And here they are Nitwit
Blubber Oddment Tweak
Thank you
He sat back down Everybody clapped and cheered Harry didnt know
whether to laugh or not
Is he  a bit mad he asked Percy uncertainly
Mad said Percy airily Hes a genius Best wizard in the world But
he is a bit mad yes Potatoes Harry
Harrys mouth fell open The dishes in front of him were now piled with
food He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table
roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon
and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries Yorkshire pudding
peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint
humbugs
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry but hed never been
allowed to eat as much as he liked Dudley had always taken anything
that Harry really wanted even if It made him sick Harry piled his
plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat
It was all delicious
That does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching Harry
cut up his steak
Cant you
