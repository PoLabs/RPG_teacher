happier Hed really done something to be proud of now  no one could
say he was just a famous name any more The evening air had never
smelled so sweet He walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour
in his head which was a happy blur Gryffindors running to lift him
onto their shoulders Ron and Hermione in the distance jumping up and
down Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed
Harry had reached the shed He leaned against the wooden door and looked
up at Hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun
Gryffindor in the lead Hed done it hed shown Snape
And speaking of Snape
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle Clearly
not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the
forbidden forest Harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched He
recognized the figures prowling walk Snape sneaking into the forest
while everyone else was at dinner  what was going on
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off Gliding
silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run He
followed
The trees were so thick he couldnt see where Snape had gone He flew in
circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he
heard voices He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering
beech tree
He climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his
broomstick trying to see through the leaves Below in a shadowy
clearing stood Snape but he wasnt alone Quirrell was there too
Harry couldnt make out the look on his face but he was stuttering
worse than ever Harry strained to catch what they were saying
 ddont know why you wanted ttto meet here of all pplaces
Severus
Oh I thought wed keep this private said Snape his voice icy
Students arent supposed to know about the Sorcerers Stone after
all
Harry leaned forward Quirrell was mumbling something Snape interrupted
him
