What about whatshername your friend  Yvonne
On vacation in Majorca snapped Aunt Petunia
You could just leave me here Harry put in hopefully hed be able to
watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go
on Dudleys computer
Aunt Petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemon
And come back and find the house in ruins she snarled
I wont blow up the house said Harry but they werent listening
I suppose we could take him to the zoo said Aunt Petunia slowly 
and leave him in the car
That cars new hes not sitting in it alone
Dudley began to cry loudly In fact he wasnt really crying  it had
been years since hed really cried  but he knew that if he screwed up
his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted
Dinky Duddydums dont cry Mummy wont let him spoil your special
day she cried flinging her arms around him
I dont want him ttto come Dudley yelled between huge
pretend sobs He always sp spoils everything He shot Harry a nasty
grin through the gap in his mothers arms
Just then the doorbell rang  Oh good Lord theyre here said Aunt
Petunia frantically  and a moment later Dudleys best friend Piers
Polkiss walked in with his mother Piers was a scrawny boy with a face
like a rat He was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their
backs while Dudley hit them Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once
Half an hour later Harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in
the back of the Dursleys car with Piers and Dudley on the way to the
zoo for the first time in his life His aunt and uncle hadnt been able
to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left Uncle
Vernon had taken Harry aside
Im warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up
