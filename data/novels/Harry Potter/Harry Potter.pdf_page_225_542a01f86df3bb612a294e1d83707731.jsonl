bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to
catch one
Not for nothing though was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century He
had a knack for spotting things other people didnt After a minutes
weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large
silver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and
stuffed roughly into the keyhole
That one he called to the others That big one  there  no there
 with bright blue wings  the feathers are all crumpled on one side
Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing crashed into
the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom
Weve got to close in on it Harry called not taking his eyes off the
key with the damaged wing Ron you come at it from above  Hermione
stay below and stop it from going down and Ill try and catch it Right
NOW
Ron dived Hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and Harry
streaked after it it sped toward the wall Harry leaned forward and
with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one
hand Ron and Hermiones cheers echoed around the high chamber
They landed quickly and Harry ran to the door the key struggling in
his hand He rammed it into the lock and turned  it worked The moment
the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very
battered now that it had been caught twice
Ready Harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle They
nodded He pulled the door open
The next chamber was so dark they couldnt see anything at all But as
they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an
astonishing sight
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black
chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what
looked like black stone Facing them way across the chamber were the
white pieces Harry Ron and Hermione shivered slightly  the towering
white chessmen had no faces
