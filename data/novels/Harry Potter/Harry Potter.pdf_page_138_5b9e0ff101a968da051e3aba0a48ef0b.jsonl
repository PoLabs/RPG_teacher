Prefects he rumbled lead your Houses back to the dormitories
immediately
Percy was in his element
Follow me Stick together first years No need to fear the troll if
you follow my orders Stay close behind me now Make way first years
coming through Excuse me Im a prefect
How could a troll get in Harry asked as they climbed the stairs
Dont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid said Ron Maybe
Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke
They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions
As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs Harry
suddenly grabbed Rons arm
Ive just thought  Hermione
What about her
She doesnt know about the troll
Ron bit his lip
Oh all right he snapped But Percyd better not see us
Ducking down they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way slipped
down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls
bathroom They had just turned the corner when they heard quick
footsteps behind them
Percy hissed Ron pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin
Peering around it however they saw not Percy but Snape He crossed the
corridor and disappeared from view
Whats he doing Harry whispered Why isnt he down in the dungeons
with the rest of the teachers
Search me
