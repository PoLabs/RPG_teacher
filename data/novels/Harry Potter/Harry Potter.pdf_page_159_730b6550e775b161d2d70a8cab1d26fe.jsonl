about even if they wouldnt work
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess This was exactly like
Muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot
like directing troops in battle Rons set was very old and battered
Like everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in
his family  in this case his grandfather However old chessmen
werent a drawback at all Ron knew them so well he never had trouble
getting them to do what he wanted
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him and they didnt
trust him at all He wasnt a very good player yet and they kept
shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing Dont
send me there cant you see his knight Send him we can afford to lose
him On Christmas Eve Harry went to bed looking forward to the next
day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all
When he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a
small pile of packages at the foot of his bed
Merry Christmas said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and
pulled on his bathrobe
You too said Harry Will you look at this Ive got some presents
What did you expect turnips said Ron turning to his own pile which
was a lot bigger than Harrys
Harry picked up the top parcel It was wrapped in thick brown paper and
scrawled across it was To Harry from Hagrid Inside was a roughly cut
wooden flute Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself Harry blew it 
it sounded a bit like an owl
A second very small parcel contained a note
We received your message and enclose your Christmas present From Uncle
Vernon and Aunt Petunia Taped to the note was a fiftypence piece
Thats friendly said Harry
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence
Weird he said NMat a shape This is money
