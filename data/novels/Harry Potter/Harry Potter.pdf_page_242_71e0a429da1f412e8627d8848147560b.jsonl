Well they did rather detest each other Not unlike yourself and Mr
Malfoy And then your father did something Snape could never forgive
What
He saved his life
What
Yes said Dumbledore dreamily Funny the way peoples minds work
isnt it Professor Snape couldnt bear being in your fathers debt
I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt
that would make him and your father even Then he could go back to
hating your fathers memory in peace
Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he
stopped
And sir theres one more thing
Just the one
How did I get the Stone out of the mirror
Ah now Im glad you asked me that It was one of my more brilliant
ideas and between you and me thats saying something You see only
one who wanted to find the Stone  find it but not use it  would be
able to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or
drinking Elixir of Life My brain surprises even me sometimes Now
enough questions I suggest you make a start on these sweets Ah Bettie
Botts Every Flavor Beans I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come
across a vomitflavored one and since then Im afraid Ive rather lost
my liking for them  but I think Ill be safe with a nice toffee dont
you
He smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his mouth Then he
choked and said Alas Ear wax
Madam Pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict
Just five minutes Harry pleaded
Absolutely not
