Weasleys and that Hagrid and itll rub off on you
Both Harry and Ron stood up

Oh youre going to fight us are you Malfoy sneered
Unless you get out now said Harry more bravely than he felt because
Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron
But we dont feet like leaving do we boys Weve eaten all our food
and you still seem to have some
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron  Ron leapt
forward but before hed so much as touched Goyle Goyle let out a
horrible yell
Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk
deep into Goyles knuckle  Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung
Scabbers round and round howling and when Scabbets finally flew off
and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once Perhaps they
thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps theyd
heard footsteps because a second later Hermione Granger had come in

Youve met Malfoy before
Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley
Ive heard of his family said Ron darkly They were some of the
first to come back to our side after YouKnowWho disappeared Said
theyd been bewitched My dad doesnt believe it He says Malfoys
father didnt need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side He turned to
Hermione Can we help you with something
