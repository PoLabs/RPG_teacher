mirror Sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head
suspended in midair his body completely invisible He pulled the cloak
over his head and his reflection vanished completely
Theres a note said Ron suddenly A note fell out of it
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter Written in narrow
loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words Your
father left this in my possession before he died It is time it was
returned to you Use it well
A Very Merry Christmas to you
There was no signature Harry stared at the note Ron was admiring the
cloak
Id give anything for one of these he said Anything Whats the
matter
Nothing said Harry He felt very strange Who had sent the cloak Had
it really once belonged to his father
Before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung
open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in Harry stuffed the cloak
quickly out of sight He didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else
yet
Merry Christmas
Hey look  Harrys got a Weasley sweater too
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow F on
it the other a G
Harrys is better than ours though said Fred holding up Harrys
sweater She obviously makes more of an effort if youre not family
Why arent you wearing yours Ron George demanded Come on get it
on theyre lovely and warm
I hate maroon Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head
