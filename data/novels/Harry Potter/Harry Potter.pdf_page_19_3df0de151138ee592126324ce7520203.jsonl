While he drove Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia He liked to
complain about things people at work Harry the council Harry the
bank and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects This morning
it was motorcycles
 roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a
motorcycle overtook them
I had a dream about a motorcycle said Harry remembering suddenly It
was flying
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front He turned right
around in his seat and yelled at Harry his face like a gigantic beet
with a mustache MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY
Dudley and Piers sniggered
I know they dont said Harry It was only a dream
But he wished he hadnt said anything If there was one thing the
Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking
about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a
dream or even a cartoon  they seemed to think he might get dangerous
ideas
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families The
Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the
entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry
what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap
lemon ice pop It wasnt bad either Harry thought licking it as they
watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley
except that it wasnt blond
Harry had the best morning hed had in a long time He was careful to
walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers who
were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall
back on their favorite hobby of hitting him They ate in the zoo
restaurant and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker
glory didnt have enough ice cream on top Uncle Vernon bought him
another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first
Harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to
last
