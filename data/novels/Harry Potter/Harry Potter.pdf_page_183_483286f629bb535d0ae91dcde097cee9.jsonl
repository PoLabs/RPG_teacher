Unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines
as Hermione They piled so much homework on them that the Easter
holidays werent nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones It was hard
to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons
blood or practicing wand movements Moaning and yawning Harry and Ron
spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get
through all their extra work
Ill never remember this Ron burst out one afternoon throwing down
his quill and looking longingly out of the library window It was the
first really fine day theyd had in months The sky was a clear
forgetmenot blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming
Harry who was looking up Dittany in One Thousand Magical Herbs and
Fungi didnt look up until he heard Ron say Hagrid What are you
doing in the library
Hagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back He looked
very out of place in his moleskin overcoat
Jus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at
once An whatre you lot up ter He looked suddenly suspicious Yer
not still lookin fer Nicolas Flamel are yeh Oh we found out who he
is ages ago said Ron impressively And we know what that dogs
guarding its a Sorcerers St 
Shhhh Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening
Don go shoutin about it whats the matter with yeh
There are a few things we wanted to ask you as a matter of fact said
Harry about whats guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy 
SHHHH said Hagrid again Listen  come an see me later Im not
promisin Ill tell yeh anythin mind but don go rabbitin about it

Hagrid shuffled off
What was he hiding behind his back said Hermione thoughtfully
