werent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time
After taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match
and started trying to turn it into a needle By the end of the lesson
only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match Professor
McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and
gave Hermione a rare smile
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense
Against the Dark Arts but Quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of
a joke His classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said
was to ward off a vampire hed met in Romania and was afraid would be
coming back to get him one of these days His turban he told them had
been given to him by an African prince as a thankyou for getting rid of
a troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this story
For one thing when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell
had fought off the zombie Quirrell went pink and started talking about
the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung
around the turban and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed
full of garlic as well so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went
Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone
else Lots of people had come from Muggle families and like him hadnt
had any idea that they were witches and wizards There was so much to
learn that even people like Ron didnt have much of a head start
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron They finally managed to
find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost
once
What have we got today Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his
porridge
Double Potions with the Slytherins said Ron Snapes Head of
Slytherin House They say he always favors them  well be able to see
if its true
Wish McGonagall favored us  said Harry Professor McGonagall was head
of Gryffindor House but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge
pile of homework the day before
Just then the mail arrived Harry had gotten used to this by now but
it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a
hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast
