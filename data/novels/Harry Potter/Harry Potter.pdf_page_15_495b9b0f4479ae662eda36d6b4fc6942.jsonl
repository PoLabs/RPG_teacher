Petunia was how he had gotten it
In the car crash when your parents died she had said And dont ask
questions
Dont ask questions  that was the first rule for a quiet life with the
Dursleys
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon
Comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting
About once a week Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and
shouted that Harry needed a haircut Harry must have had more haircuts
than the rest of the boys in his class put
together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way 
all over the place
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
mother Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon He had a large pink face
not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay
smoothly on his thick fat head Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley
looked like a baby angel  Harry often said that Dudley looked like a
pig in a wig
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult
as there wasnt much room Dudley meanwhile was counting his presents
His face fell
Thirtysix he said looking up at his mother and father Thats two
less than last year
Darling you havent counted Auntie Marges present see its here
under this big one from Mommy and Daddy
All right thirtyseven then said Dudley going red in the face
Harry who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down
his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly
And well buy you another two presents while were out today Hows
that popkin Two more presents Is that all right
