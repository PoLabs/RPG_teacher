fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape Harry moved
nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection
again He stepped in front of it
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming He
whirled around His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the
book had screamed  for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but
a whole crowd of people standing right behind him
But the room was empty Breathing very fast he turned slowly back to
the mirror
There he was reflected in it white and scaredlooking and there
reflected behind him were at least ten others Harry looked over his
shoulder  but still no one was there Or were they all invisible
too Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors
trick was that it reflected them invisible or not
He looked in the mirror again A woman standing right behind his
reflection was smiling at him and waving He reached out a hand and felt
the air behind him If she was really there hed touch her their
reflections were so close together but he felt only air  she and the
others existed only in the mirror
She was a very pretty woman She had dark red hair and her eyes  her
eyes are just like mine Harry thought edging a little closer to the
glass Bright green  exactly the same shape but then he noticed that
she was crying smiling but crying at the same time The tall thin
blackhaired man standing next to her put his arm around her He wore
glasses and his hair was very untidy It stuck up at the back just as
Harrys did
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching
that of his reflection
Mom he whispered Dad
They just looked at him smiling And slowly Harry looked into the
faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green
eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as
though he had Harrys knobbly knees  Harry was looking at his family
for the first time in his life
