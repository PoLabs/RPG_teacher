Five said Ron For some reason he was looking gloomy Im the sixth
in our family to go to Hogwarts You could say Ive got a lot to live up
to Bill and Charlie have already left  Bill was head boy and Charlie
was captain of Quidditch Now Percys a prefect Fred and George mess
around a lot but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks
theyre really funny Everyone expects me to do as well as the others
but if I do its no big deal because they did it first You never get
anything new either with five brothers Ive got Bills old robes
Charlies old wand and Percys old rat
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat which was
asleep
His names Scabbers and hes useless he hardly ever wakes up Percy
got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldnt aff
 I mean I got Scabbers instead
Rons ears went pink He seemed to think hed said too much because he
went back to staring out of the window
Harry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to
afford an owl After all hed never had any money in his life until a
month ago and he told Ron so all about having to wear Dudleys old
clothes and never getting proper birthday presents This seemed to cheer
Ron up
 and until Hagrid told me I didnt know anything about be ing a
wizard or about my parents or Voldemort
Ron gasped
What said Harry
You said YouKnowWhos name said Ron sounding both shocked and
impressed Id have thought you of all people 
Im not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said Harry I
just never knew you shouldnt See what I mean Ive got loads to
learn I bet he added voicing for the first time something that
had been worrying him a lot lately I bet Im the worst in the class
You wont be Theres loads of people who come from Muggle families and
they learn quick enough
