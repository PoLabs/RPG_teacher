 come on now Angelina  Keeper Bletchley dives  misses 
GRYFFINDORS SCORE
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the
Slytherins
Budge up there move along
Hagrid
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join
them
Bin watchin from me hut said Hagrid patting a large pair of
binoculars around his neck But it isnt the same as bein in the
crowd No sign of the Snitch yet eh
Nope said Ron Harry hasnt had much to do yet
Kept outta trouble though thats somethin said Hagrid raising his
binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry
Way up above them Harry was gliding over the game squinting about for
some sign of the Snitch This was part of his and Woods game plan
Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch Wood had
said We dont want you attacked before you have to be
When Angelina had scored Harry had done a couple of looptheloops to
let off his feelings Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch
Once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection
from one of the Weasleys wristwatches and once a Bludger decided to
come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but Harry
dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it
All right there Harry he had time to yell as he beat the Bludger
furiously toward Marcus Flint
Slytherin in possession Lee Jordan was saying Chaser Pucey ducks
two Bludgers two Weasleys and Chaser Bell and speeds toward the 
wait a moment  was that the Snitch
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle too
