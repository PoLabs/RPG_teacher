Malfoy didnt move He looked at Hagrid furiously but then dropped his
gaze
Right then said Hagrid now listen carefully cause its dangerous
what were gonna do tonight an I don want no one takin risks Follow
me over here a moment
He led them to the very edge of the forest Holding his lamp up high he
pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the
thick black trees A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into
the forest
Look there said Hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground
Silvery stuff Thats unicorn blood Theres a unicorn in there bin hurt
badly by summat This is the second time in a week I found one dead
last Wednesday Were gonna try an find the poor thing We might have
ter put it out of its misery
And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said Malfoy
unable to keep the fear out of his voice
Theres nothin that lives in the forest thatll hurt yeh if yer with
me or Fang said Hagrid An keep ter the path Right now were
gonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diffrent
directions Theres blood all over the place it mustve bin staggerin
around since last night at least
I want Fang said Malfoy quickly looking at Fangs long teeth
All right but I warn yeh hes a coward said Hagrid  So me Harry
an Hermionell go one way an Draco Neville an Fangll go the other
Now if any of us finds the unicorn well send up green sparks right
Get yer wands out an practice now  thats it  an if anyone gets in
trouble send up red sparks an well all come an find yeh  so be
careful  lets go
The forest was black and silent A little way into it they reached a
fork in the earth path and Harry Hermione and Hagrid took the left
path while Malfoy Neville and Fang took the right
They walked in silence their eyes on the ground Every now and then a
ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silverblue
