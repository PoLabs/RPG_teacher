The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at
them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping
to fall right through it and reach them He had a powerful kind of ache
inside him half joy half terrible sadness
How long he stood there he didnt know The reflections did not fade
and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his
senses He couldnt stay here he had to find his way back to bed He
tore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered Ill come back
and hurried from the room
You could have woken me up said Ron crossly
You can come tonight Im going back I want to show you the mirror
Id like to see your mom and dad Ron said eagerly
And I want to see all your family all the Weasleys youll be able to
show me your other brothers and everyone
You can see them any old time said Ron Just come round my house
this summer Anyway maybe it only shows dead people Shame about not
finding Flamel though Have some bacon or something why arent you
eating anything
Harry couldnt eat He had seen his parents and would be seeing them
again tonight He had almost forgotten about Flamel It didnt seem very
important anymore Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding
What did it matter if Snape stole it really
Are you all right said Ron You look odd
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror
room again With Ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much
more slowly the next night They tried retracing Harrys route from the
library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour
Im freezing said Ron Lets forget it and go back
No Harry hissed I know its here somewhere
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction
but saw no one else just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead
