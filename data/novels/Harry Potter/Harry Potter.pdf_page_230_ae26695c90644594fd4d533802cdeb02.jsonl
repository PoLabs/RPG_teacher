Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry amazed saw that she was
smiling the very last thing he felt like doing
Brilliant said Hermione This isnt magic  its logic  a puzzle
A lot of the greatest wizards havent got an ounce of logic theyd be
stuck in here forever
But so will we wont we Of course not said Hermione Everything
we need is here on this paper Seven bottles three are poison two are
wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us
back through the purple
But how do we know which to drink
Give me a minute
Hermione read the paper several times Then she walked up and down the
line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them At last she
clapped her hands
Got it she said The smallest bottle will get us through the black
fire  toward the Stone
Harry looked at the tiny bottle
Theres only enough there for one of us he said Thats hardly one
swallow
They looked at each other
Which one will get you back through the purple flames
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line
You drink that said Harry No listen get back and get Ron Grab
brooms from the flying key room theyll get you out of the trapdoor
and past Fluffy  go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to
Dumbledore we need him I might be able to hold Snape off for a while
but Im no match for him really
But Harry  what if YouKnowWhos with him
Well  I was lucky once wasnt I said Harry pointing at his scar
