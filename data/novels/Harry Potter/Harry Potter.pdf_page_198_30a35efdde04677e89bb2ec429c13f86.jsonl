Your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight Meet Mr Filch
in the entrance hall
Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do
in the furor over the points theyd lost He half expected Hermione to
complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt
say a word Like Harry she felt they deserved what theyd got
At eleven oclock that night they said goodbye to Ron in the common
room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville Filch was already
there  and so was Malfoy Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had
gotten a detention too
Follow me said Filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside
I bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you
eh he said leering at them Oh yes hard work and pain are the
best teachers if you ask me Its just a pity they let the old
punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a
few days Ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in
case theyre ever needed Right off we go and dont think of
running off now itll be worse for you if you do
They marched off across the dark grounds Neville kept sniffing Harry
wondered what their punishment was going to be It must be something
really horrible or Filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted
The moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them
into darkness Ahead Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrids
hut Then they heard a distant shout
Is that you Filch Hurry up I want ter get started
Harrys heart rose if they were going to be working with Hagrid it
wouldnt be so bad His relief must have showed in his face because
Filch said I suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that
oaf Well think again boy  its into the forest youre going and Im
much mistaken if youll all come out in one piece
At this Neville let out a little moan and Malfoy stopped dead in his
tracks
