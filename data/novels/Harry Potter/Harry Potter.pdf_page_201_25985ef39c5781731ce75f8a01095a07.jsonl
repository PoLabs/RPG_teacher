blood on the fallen leaves
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried
Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns Harry asked
Not fast enough said Hagrid Its not easy ter catch a unicorn
theyre powerful magic creatures I never knew one ter be hurt before
They walked past a mossy tree stump Harry could hear running water
there must be a stream somewhere close by There were still spots of
unicorn blood here and there along the winding path
You all right Hermione Hagrid whispered Don worry it cantve
gone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter  GET
BEHIND THAT TREE
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a
towering oak He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow
raising it ready to fire The three of them listened Something was
slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing
along the ground Hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few
seconds the sound faded away
I knew it  he murmured Theres summat in here that shouldn be
A werewolf Harry suggested
That wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said Hagrid
grimly Right follow me but careful now
They walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest sound
Suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved
Whos there Hagrid called Show yerself  Im armed
And into the clearing came  was it a man or a horse To the waist a
man with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming
chestnut body with a long reddish tail Harry and Hermiones jaws
dropped
Oh its you Ronan said Hagrid in relief How are yeh
