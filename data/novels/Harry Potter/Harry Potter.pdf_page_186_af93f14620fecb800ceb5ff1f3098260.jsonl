have a window open Im boiling
Cant Harry sorry said Hagrid Harry noticed him glance at the
fire Harry looked at it too
Hagrid  whats that
But he already knew what it was In the very heart of the fire
underneath the kettle was a huge black egg
Ah said Hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard Thats er
Where did you get it Hagrid said Ron crouching over the fire to get
a closer look at the egg It mustve cost you a fortune
Won it said Hagrid Las night I was down in the village havin a
few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger Think he was
quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honest
But what are you going to do with it when its hatched said Hermione
Well Ive bin doin some readin  said Hagrid pulling a large book
from under his pillow Got this outta the library  Dragon Breeding
for Pleasure and Profit  its a bit outta date o course but its
all in here Keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on I
em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with
chicken blood every half hour An see here  how ter recognize
diffrent eggs  what I got theres a Norwegian Ridgeback Theyre
rare them
He looked very pleased with himself but Hermione didnt
Hagrid you live in a wooden house she said
But Hagrid wasnt listening He was humming merrily as he stoked the
fire
So now they had something else to worry about what might happen to
Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut
Wonder what its like to have a peaceful life Ron sighed as evening
after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were
getting Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and
Ron too It was driving them nuts
