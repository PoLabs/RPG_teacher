Dumbledores around Anyway weve never had any proof Snape found out
how to get past Fluffy He nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not
going to try it again in a hurry And Neville will play Quidditch for
England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down
Harry nodded but he couldnt shake off a lurking feeling that there was
something hed forgotten to do something important When he tried to
explain this Hermione said Thats just the exams I woke up last
night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I
remembered wed done that one
Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything to do
with work though He watched an owl flutter toward the school across
the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth Hagrid was the only
one who ever sent him letters Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore
Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy never but 
Harry suddenly jumped to his feet
Wherere you going said Ron sleepily
Ive just thought of something said Harry He had turned white
Weve got to go and see Hagrid now
Why panted Hermione hurrying to keep up
Dont you think its a bit odd said Harry scrambling up the grassy
slope that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and
a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket How
many people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law
Lucky they found Hagrid dont you think Why didnt I see it before
What are you talking about said Ron but Harry sprinting across the
grounds toward the forest didnt answer
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and
sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl
Hullo he said smiling Finished yer exams Got time fer a drink
Yes please said Ron but Harry cut him off
No were in a hurry Hagrid Ive got to ask you something You know
