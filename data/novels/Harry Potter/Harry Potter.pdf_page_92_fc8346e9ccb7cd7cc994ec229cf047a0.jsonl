A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years
Nobody answered
New students said the Fat Friar smiling around at them About to be
Sorted I suppose
A few people nodded mutely
Hope to see you in Hufflepuff said the Friar My old house you
know
Move along now said a sharp voice The Sorting Ceremonys about to
start
Professor McGonagall had returned One by one the ghosts floated away
through the opposite wall
Now form a line Professor McGonagall told the first years and
follow me
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead Harry got into line
behind a boy with sandy hair with Ron behind him and they walked out
of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors
into the Great Hall
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place It was
lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair
over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting
These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets At the
top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a
halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind them
The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the
flickering candlelight Dotted here and there among the students the
ghosts shone misty silver Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes Harry
looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars He
heard
Hermione whisper Its bewitched to look like the sky outside I read
about it in Hogwarts A History
