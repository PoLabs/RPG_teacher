stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it
Make yerselves at home said Hagrid letting go of Fang who bounded
straight at Ron and started licking his ears Like Hagrid Fang was
clearly not as fierce as he looked
This is Ron Harry told Hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a
large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate
Another Weasley eh said Hagrid glancing at Rons freckles I spent
half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest
The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their
teeth but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told
Hagrid all about their first lessons Fang rested his head on Harrys
knee and drooled all over his robes
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch that old git
An as fer that cat Mrs Norris Id like ter introduce her to Fang
sometime Dyeh know every time I go up ter the school she follows me
everywhere Cant get rid of her  Fitch puts her up to it
Harry told Hagrid about Snapes lesson Hagrid like Ron told Harry not
to worry about it that Snape liked hardly any of the students
But he seemed to really hate me
Rubbish said Hagrid Why should he
Yet Harry couldnt help thinking that Hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes
when he said that
Hows yer brother Charlie Hagrid asked Ron I liked him a lot 
great with animals
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose While Ron
told Hagrid all about Charlies work with dragons Harry picked up a
piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy It was a
cutting from the Daily Prophet
