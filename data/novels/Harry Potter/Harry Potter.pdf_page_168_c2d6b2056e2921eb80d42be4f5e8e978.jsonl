with cold Harry spotted the suit of armor
Its here  just here  yes
They pushed the door open Harry dropped the cloak from around his
shoulders and ran to the mirror
There they were His mother and father beamed at the sight of him
See Harry whispered
I cant see anything
Look Look at them all there are loads of them
I can only see you
Look in it properly go on stand where I am
Harry stepped aside but with Ron in front of the mirror he couldnt
see his family anymore just Ron in his paisley pajamas
Ron though was staring transfixed at his image
Look at me he said
Can you see all your family standing around you
No  Im alone  but Im different  I look older  and Im head
boy

house cup and the Quidditch cup  Im Quidditch captain too
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at
Harry
Do you think this mirror shows the future
How can it All my family are dead  let me have another look
