Dudley thought for a moment It looked like hard work Finally he said
slowly So Ill have thirty  thirty
Thirtynine sweetums said Aunt Petunia
Oh Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel All right
then
Uncle Vernon chuckled Little tyke wants his moneys worth just like
his father Atta boy Dudley He ruffled Dudleys hair
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it
while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike a
video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and
a VCR He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia
came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried
Bad news Vernon she said Mrs Figgs broken her leg She cant
take him She jerked her head in Harrys direction
Dudleys mouth fell open in horror but Harrys heart gave a leap Every
year on Dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the
day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies Every
year Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg a mad old lady who lived two
streets away Harry hated it there The whole house smelled of cabbage
and Mrs Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever
owned
Now what said Aunt Petunia looking furiously at Harry as though hed
planned this Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had
broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be
a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles Snowy Mr Paws and
Tufty again
We could phone Marge Uncle Vernon suggested
Dont be silly Vernon she hates the boy
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this as though he wasnt
there  or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt
understand them like a slug
