had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror
But Snape always seemed to hate me so much
Oh he does said Quirrell casually heavens yes He was at Hogwarts
with your father didnt you know They loathed each other But he never
wanted you dead
But I heard you a few days ago sobbing  I thought Snape was
threatening you
For the first time a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrells face
Sometimes he said I find it hard to follow my masters instructions
 he is a great wizard and I am weak 
You mean he was there in the classroom with you Harry gasped
He is with me wherever I go said Quirrell quietly I met him when I
traveled around the world A foolish young man I was then full of
ridiculous ideas about good and evil Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong
I was There is no good and evil there is only power and those too
weak to seek it Since then I have served him faithfully although I
have let him down many times He has had to be very hard on me
Quirrell shivered suddenly He does not forgive mistakes easily When I
failed to steal the stone from Gringotts he was most displeased He
punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me
Quirrells voice trailed away Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon
Alley how could he have been so stupid Hed seen Quirrell there that
very day shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron
Quirrell cursed under his breath
I dont understand is the Stone inside the mirror Should I break
it
Harrys mind was racing
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment he
thought is to find the Stone before Quirrell does So if I look in the
mirror I should see myseff finding it  which means Ill see where
its hidden But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what Im up
