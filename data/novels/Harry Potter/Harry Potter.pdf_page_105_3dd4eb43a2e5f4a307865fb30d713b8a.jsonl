Next to the tall kid with the red hair
Wearing the glasses
Did you see his face
Did you see his scar
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next
day People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look
at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring
Harry wished they wouldnt because he was trying to concentrate on
finding his way to classes
There were a hundred and fortytwo staircases at Hogwarts wide
sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different
on a Friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to
remember to jump Then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you
asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors
that werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending It
was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed
to move around a lot The people in the portraits kept going to visit
each other and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk
The ghosts didnt help either It was always a nasty shock when one of
them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open Nearly
Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right
direction but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a
trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class He would
drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet
pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab
your nose and screech GOT YOUR CONK
Even worse than Peeves if that was possible was the caretaker Argus
Filch Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their
very first morning Filch found them trying to force their way through a
door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the outofbounds
corridor on the third floor He wouldnt believe they were lost was
sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening
to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor
Quirrell who was passing
