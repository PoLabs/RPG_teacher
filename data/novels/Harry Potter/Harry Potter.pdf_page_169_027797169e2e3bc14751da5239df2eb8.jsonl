You had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time
Youre only holding the Quidditch cup whats interesting about that I
want to see my parents
Dont push me 
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion
They hadnt realized how loudly they had been talking
Quick
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs Norris
came round the door Ron and Harry stood quite still both thinking the
same thing  did the cloak work on cats After what seemed an age she
turned and left
This isnt safe  she might have gone for Filch I bet she heard us
Come on
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room
The snow still hadnt melted the next morning
Want to play chess Harry said Ron
No
Why dont we go down and visit Hagrid
No you go
I know what youre thinking about Harry that mirror Dont go back
tonight
Why not
I dunno Ive just got a bad feeling about it  and anyway youve had
too many close shaves already Filch Snape and Mrs Norris are
wandering around So what if they cant see you What if they walk into
you What if you knock something over
You sound like Hermione
