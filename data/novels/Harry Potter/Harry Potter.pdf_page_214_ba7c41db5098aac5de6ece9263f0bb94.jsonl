Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected it wasnt that The books
she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didnt pick them up
How do you know  she spluttered
Professor I think  I know  that Sn that someones going to try
and steal the Stone Ive got to talk to Professor Dumbledore
She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion
Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally I dont
know how you found out about the Stone but rest assured no one can
possibly steal it its too well protected
But Professor 
Potter I know what Im talking about she said shortly She bent down
and gathered up the fallen books I suggest you all go back outside and
enjoy the sunshine
But they didnt
Its tonight said Harry once he was sure Professor McGonagall was
out of earshot Snapes going through the trapdoor tonight Hes found
out everything he needs and now hes got Dumbledore out of the way He
sent that note I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when
Dumbledore turns up
But what can we 
Hermione gasped Harry and Ron wheeled round
Snape was standing there
Good afternoon he said smoothly
They stared at him
You shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said with an odd
twisted smile
We were  Harry began without any idea what he was going to say
You want to be more careful said Snape Hanging around
