I know some things he said I can you know do math and stuff But
Hagrid simply waved his hand and said About our world I mean Your
world My world Yer parents world
What world
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode
DURSLEY he boomed
Uncle Vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded
like Mimblewimble Hagrid stared wildly at Harry
But yeh must know about yet mom and dad he said I mean theyre
famous Youre famous
What My  my mom and dad werent famous were they
Yeh don know yeh don know Hagrid ran his fingers through his
hair fixing Harry with a bewildered stare
Yeh don know what yeh are he said finally
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice
Stop he commanded Stop right there sit I forbid you to tell the
boy anything
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious
look Hagrid now gave him when Hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled
with rage
You never told him Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore
left fer him I was there I saw Dumbledore leave it Dursley An
youve kept it from him all these years
Kept what from me said Harry eagerly
STOP I FORBID YOU yelled Uncle Vernon in panic
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror
