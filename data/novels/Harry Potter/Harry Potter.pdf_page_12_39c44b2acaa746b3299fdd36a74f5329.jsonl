great shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very
scratchy whiskery kiss Then suddenly Hagrid let out a howl like a
wounded dog
Shhh hissed Professor McGonagall youll wake the Muggles
Sssorry sobbed Hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and
burying his face in it But I cccant stand it  Lily an James dead
 an poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles 
Yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself Hagrid or
well be found Professor McGonagall whispered patting Hagrid gingerly
on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to
the front door He laid Harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out
of his cloak tucked it inside Harrys blankets and then came back to
the other two For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle Hagrids shoulders shook Professor McGonagall
blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from
Dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out
Well said Dumbledore finally thats that Weve no business staying
here We may as well go and join the celebrations
Yeah said Hagrid in a very muffled voice Ill be takin Sirius his
bike back Gnight Professor McGonagall  Professor Dumbledore sir
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve Hagrid swung himself
onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose
into the air and off into the night
I shall see you soon I expect Professor McGonagall said Dumbledore
nodding to her Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street On the corner he
stopped and took out the silver PutOuter He clicked it once and
twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet
Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking
around the corner at the other end of the street He could just see the
bundle of blankets on the step of number four
Good luck Harry he murmured He turned on his heel and with a swish
of his cloak he was gone
