Well hurry up I cant breathe Harry gasped wrestling with it as it
curled around his chest
Devils Snare Devils Snare what did Professor Sprout say  it
likes the dark and the damp
So light a fire Harry choked
Yes  of course  but theres no wood Hermione cried wringing her
hands
HAVE YOU GONE MAD Ron bellowed ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT
Oh right said Hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it
muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had
used on Snape at the plant In a matter of seconds the two boys felt it
loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth
Wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they
were able to pull free
Lucky you pay attention in Herbology Hermione said Harry as he
joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face
Yeah said Ron and lucky Harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis 
theres no wood honestly
This way said Harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the
only way forward
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of
water trickling down the walls The passageway sloped downward and
Harry was reminded of Gringotts With an unpleasant jolt of the heart
he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards
bank If they met a dragon a fullygrown dragon  Norbert had been bad
enough
Can you hear something Ron whispered
Harry listened A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up
ahead
Do you think its a ghost
