of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end They
reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle
children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood Harry mounted his broomstick
and kicked off from the ground What a feeling  he swooped in and out
of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field The Nimbus Two
Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch
Hey Potter come down
Oliver Wood had arrived fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his
arm Harry landed next to him
Very nice said Wood his eyes glinting I see what McGonagall
meant you really are a natural Im just going to teach you the rules
this evening then youll be joining team practice three times a week
He opened the crate Inside were four differentsized balls
Right said Wood Now Quidditch is easy enough to understand even
if its not too easy to play There are seven players on each side
Three of them are called Chasers
Three Chasers Harry repeated as Wood took out a bright red ball
about the size of a soccer ball
This balls called the Quaffle said Wood The Chasers throw the
Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to
score a goal Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the
hoops Follow me
The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score
Harry recited So  thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with
six hoops isnt it
Whats basketball said Wood curiously Never mind said Harry
quickly
Now theres another player on each side whos called the Keeper Im
Keeper for Gryffindor I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other
team from scoring
