Hes late maybe hes chickened out Ron whispered
Then a noise in the next room made them jump Harry had only just raised
his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasnt Malfoy
Sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner
It was Filch speaking to Mrs Norris Horrorstruck Harry waved madly
at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried
silently toward the door away from Filchs voice Nevilles robes had
barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy
room
Theyre in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding
This way Harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to
creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor They could hear Filch
getting nearer Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke
into a run he tripped grabbed Ron around the waist and the pair of
them toppled right into a suit of armor
The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle
RUN Harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not
looking back to see whether Filch was following  they swung around the
doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another Harry in the lead
without any idea where they were or where they were going  they ripped
through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled
along it and came out near their Charms classroom which they knew was
miles from the trophy room
I think weve lost him Harry panted leaning against the cold wall
and wiping his forehead Neville was bent double wheezing and
spluttering
I  told you Hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest
I  told  you
Weve got to get back to Gryffindor tower said Ron quickly as
possible
Malfoy tricked you Hermione said to Harry You realize that dont
you He was never going to meet you  Filch knew someone was going to
