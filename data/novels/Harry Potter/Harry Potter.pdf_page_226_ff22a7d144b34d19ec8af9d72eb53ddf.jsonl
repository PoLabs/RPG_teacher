Now what do we do Harry whispered
Its obvious isnt it said Ron Weve got to play our way across
the room
Behind the white pieces they could see another door
How said Hermione nervously
I think said Ron were going to have to be chessmen
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the
knights horse At once the stone sprang to life The horse pawed the
ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron
Do we  er  have to join you to get across The black knight
nodded Ron turned to the other two
This needs thinking about 
he said I suppose weve got to take the
place of three of the black pieces
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet watching Ron think Finally he said
Now dont be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at
chess 
Were not offended said Harry quickly Just tell us what to do
Well Harry you take the place of that bishop and Hermione YOU 90
next to him instead of that castle
What about you
Im going to be a knight said Ron
The chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a
knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces
and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that Harry Ron
and Hermione took
White always plays first in chess said Ron peering across the board
Yes look
A white pawn had moved forward two squares
