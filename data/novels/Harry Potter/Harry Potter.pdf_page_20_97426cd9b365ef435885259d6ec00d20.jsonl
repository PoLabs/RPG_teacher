After lunch they went to the reptile house It was cool and dark in
there with lit windows all along the walls Behind the glass all sorts
of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and
stone Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick
mancrushing pythons Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the
place It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernons car
and crushed it into a trash can  but at the moment it didnt look in
the mood In fact it was fast asleep
Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the
glistening brown coils
Make it move he whined at his father Uncle Vernon tapped on the
glass but the snake didnt budge
Do it again Dudley ordered Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly
with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on
This is boring Dudley moaned He shuffled away
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake He
wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself  no
company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying
to disturb it all day long It was worse than having a cupboard as a
bedroom where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door
to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes Slowly very slowly it raised
its head until its eyes were on a level with Harrys
It winked
Harry stared Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was
watching They werent He looked back at the snake and winked too
The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley then raised
its eyes to the ceiling It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly
I get that all the time
I know Harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the
snake could hear him It must be really annoying
