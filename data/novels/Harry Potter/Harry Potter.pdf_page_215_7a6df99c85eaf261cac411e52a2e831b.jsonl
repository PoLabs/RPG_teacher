like this people will think youre up to something And Gryffindor
really cant afford to lose any more points can it
Harry flushed They turned to go outside but Snape called them back
Be warned Potter  any more nighttime wanderings and I will
personally make sure you are expelled Good day to you
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom
Out on the stone steps Harry turned to the others
Right heres what weve got to do he whispered urgently One of us
has got to keep an eye on Snape  wait outside the staff room and
follow him if he leaves it Hermione youd better do that
Why me
Its obvious said Ron You can pretend to be waiting for Professor
Flitwick you know He put on a high voice Oh Professor Flitwick
Im so worried I think I got question fourteen b wrong
Oh shut up said Hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for
Snape
And wed better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor Harry told Ron
Come on
But that part of the plan didnt work No sooner had they reached the
door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor
McGonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temper
I suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of
enchantments she stormed Enough of this nonsense If I hear you ve
come anywhere near here again Ill take another fifty points from
Gryffindor Yes Weasley from my own house Harry and Ron went back to
the common room Harry had just said At least Hermiones on Snapes
tail when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came
in
Im sorry Harry she wailed Snape came out and asked me what I was
doing so I said I was waiting for Flitwick and Snape went to get him
