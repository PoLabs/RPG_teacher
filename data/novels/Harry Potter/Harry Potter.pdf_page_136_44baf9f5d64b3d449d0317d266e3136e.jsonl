Perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with Quidditch practice
three evenings a week on top of all his homework but Harry could hardly
believe it when he realized that hed already been at Hogwarts two
months The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had His
lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had
mastered the basics
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin
wafting through the corridors Even better Professor Flitwick announced
in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly
something they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make
Nevilles toad zoom around the classroom Professor Flitwick put the
class into pairs to practice Harrys partner was Seamus Finnigan which
was a relief because Neville had been trying to catch his eye Ron
however was to be working with Hermione Granger It was hard to tell
whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this She hadnt spoken to
either of them since the day Harrys broomstick had arrived
Now dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicing
squeaked Professor Flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as
usual Swish and flick remember swish and flick And saying the magic
words properly is very important too  never forget Wizard Baruffio
who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a
buffalo on his chest
It was very difficult Harry and Seamus swished and flicked but the
feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the
desktop Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and
set fire to it  Harry had to put it out with his hat
Ron at the next table wasnt having much more luck
Wingardium Leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill
Youre saying it wrong Harry heard Hermione snap Its Winggardium
Leviosa make the gar nice and long
You do it then if youre so clever Ron snarled
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said
Wingardium Leviosa
