there Unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the
teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew hed never
get one These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never
taught at Hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced
Defense Against the Dark Arts
What are you looking for boy
Nothing said Harry
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him
Youd better get out then Go on  out
Wishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some story Harry left
the library He Ron and Hermione had already agreed theyd better not
ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel They were sure shed be
able to tell them but they couldnt risk Snape hearing what they were
up to
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found
anything but he wasnt very hopeful They had been looking for two
weeks after A but as they only had odd moments between lessons it
wasnt surprising theyd found nothing What they really needed was a
nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks
Five minutes later Ron and Hermione joined him shaking their heads
They went off to lunch
You will keep looking while Im away wont you said Hermione And
send me an owl if you find anything
And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is said Ron
Itd be safe to ask them
Very safe as theyre both dentists said Hermione
Once the holidays had started Ron and Harry were having too good a time
to think much about Flamel They had the dormitory to themselves and the
common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the
good armchairs by the fire They sat by the hour eating anything they
could spear on a toasting fork  bread English muffins marshmallows
 and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled which were fun to talk
