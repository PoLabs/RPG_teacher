Hurry up their mother said and the three boys clambered onto the
train They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them goodbye and
their younger sister began to cry
Dont Ginny well send you loads of owls
Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat
George
Only joking Mom
The train began to move Harry saw the boys mother waving and their
sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train
until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the
corner Houses flashed past the window Harry felt a great leap of
excitement He didnt know what he was going to but it had to be better
than what he was leaving behind
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy
came in
Anyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite Harry
Everywhere else is full
Harry shook his head and the boy sat down He glanced at Harry and then
looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadnt looked Harry saw
he still had a black mark on his nose
Hey Ron
The twins were back
Listen were going down the middle of the train  Lee Jordans got a
giant tarantula down there
Right mumbled Ron
Harry said the other twin did we introduce ourselves Fred and
George Weasley And this is Ron our brother See you later then
