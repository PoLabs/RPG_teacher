Firenze Bane thundered What are you doing You have a human on your

donkeys after stray humans in our forest

with humans alongside me if I must
And Firenze whisked around with Harry clutching on as best he could
they plunged off into the trees leaving Ronan and Bane behind them
Harry didnt have a clue what was going on

particularly dense patch of trees however when Firenze suddenly
