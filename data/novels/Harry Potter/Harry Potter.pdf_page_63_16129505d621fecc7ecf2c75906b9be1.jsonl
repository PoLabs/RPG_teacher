Years an years ago said Hagrid
They bought Harrys school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as
paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in
covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with
nothing in them at all Even Dudley who never read anything would have
been wild to get his hands on some of these Hagrid almost had to drag
Harry away from Curses and Countercurses Bewitch Your Friends and
Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges Hair Loss JellyLegs
Tongue Tying and Much Much More by Professor Vindictus Viridian
I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley
Im not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the
Muggle world except in very special circumstances said Hagrid An
anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot more
study before yeh get ter that level
Hagrid wouldnt let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron either It says
pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing
potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope Then they visited
the Apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible
smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages Barrels of slimy stuff
stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined
the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung
from the ceiling While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a
supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry Harry himself
examined silver unicorn horns at twentyone Galleons each and minuscule
glitteryblack beetle eyes five Knuts a scoop
Outside the Apothecary Hagrid checked Harrys list again
Just yer wand left  A yeah an I still havent got yeh a birthday
present
Harry felt himself go red
You dont have to 
I know I dont have to Tell yeh what Ill get yer animal Not a toad
toads went outta fashion years ago yehd be laughed at  an I don
like cats they make me sneeze Ill get yer an owl All the kids want
