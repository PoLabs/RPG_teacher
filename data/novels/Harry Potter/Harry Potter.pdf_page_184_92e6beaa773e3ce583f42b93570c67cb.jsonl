Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone
Im going to see what section he was in said Ron whod had enough of
working He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms
and slammed them down on the table
Dragons he whispered Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons
Look at these Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland From Egg to
Inferno A Dragon Keepers Guide
Hagrids always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time I ever
met him  said Harry
But its against our laws said Ron Dragon breeding was outlawed by
the Warlocks Convention of 1709 everyone knows that Its hard to stop
Muggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in the back garden 
anyway you cant tame dragons its dangerous You should see the burns
Charlies got off wild ones in Romania
But there arent wild dragons in Britain said Harry
Of course there are said Ron Common Welsh Green and Hebridean
Blacks The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up I can tell you
Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles whove spotted them to
make them forget
So what on earths Hagrid up to said Hermione
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour later
they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed Hagrid
called Who is it before he let them in and then shut the door
quickly behind them
It was stifling hot inside Even though it was such a warm day there
was a blazing fire in the grate Hagrid made them tea and offered them
stoat sandwiches which they refused
So  yeh wanted to ask me somethin
Yes said Harry There was no point beating around the bush We were
wondering if you could tell us whats guarding the Sorcerers Stone
apart from Fluffy
