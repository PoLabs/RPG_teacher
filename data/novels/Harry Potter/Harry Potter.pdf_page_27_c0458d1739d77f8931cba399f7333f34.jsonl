Harry didnt move
I WANT MY LETTER he shouted
Let me see it demanded Dudley
OUT roared Uncle Vernon and he took both Harry and Dudley by the
scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the
kitchen door behind them Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but
silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole Dudley won so Harry
his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at
the crack between door and floor
Vernon Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the
address  how could they possibly know where he sleeps You dont think
theyre watching the house
Watching  spying  might be following us muttered Uncle Vernon
wildly
But what should we do Vernon Should we write back Tell them we dont
want 
Harry could see Uncle Vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the
kitchen
No he said finally No well ignore it If they dont get an
answer Yes thats best we wont do anything
But 
Im not having one in the house Petunia Didnt we swear when we took
him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsense
That evening when he got back from work Uncle Vernon did something hed
never done before he visited Harry in his cupboard
Wheres my letter said Harry the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed
through the door Whos writing to me
No one it was addressed to you by mistake said Uncle Vernon shortly
I have burned it
