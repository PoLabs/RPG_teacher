But if we get caught you two will be expelled too
Not if I can help it said Hermione grimly Flitwick told me in
secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam Theyre not
throwing me out after that
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room
Nobody bothered them none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to
Harry any more after all This was the first night he hadnt been upset
by it Hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come
across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break Harry
and Ron didnt talk much Both of them were thinking about what they
were about to do
Slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed
Better get the cloak Ron muttered as Lee Jordan finally left
stretching and yawning Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory He
putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had
given him for Christmas He pocketed it to use on Fluffy  he didnt
feel much like singing
He ran back down to the common room
Wed better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of
us  if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own 
What are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room Neville
appeared from behind an armchair clutching Trevor the toad who looked
as though hed been making another bid for freedom
Nothing Neville nothing said Harry hurriedly putting the cloak
behind his back
Neville stared at their guilty faces
Youre going out again he said
No no no said Hermione No were not Why dont you go to bed
Neville
Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door They couldnt afford
to waste any more time Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep
