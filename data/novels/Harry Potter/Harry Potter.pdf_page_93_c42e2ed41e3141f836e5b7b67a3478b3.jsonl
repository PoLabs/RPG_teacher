It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the
Great Hall didnt simply open on to the heavens
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed
a fourlegged stool in front of the first years On top of the stool she
put a pointed wizards hat This hat was patched and frayed and
extremely dirty Aunt Petunia wouldnt have let it in the house
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it Harry thought wildly
that seemed the sort of thing  noticing that everyone in the hall was
now staring at the hat he stared at it too For a few seconds there
was complete silence Then the hat twitched A rip near the brim opened
wide like a mouth  and the hat began to sing
Oh you may not think Im pretty
But dont judge on what you see
Ill eat myself if you can find
A smarter hat than me
You can keep your bowlers black
Your top hats sleek and tall
For Im the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
And I can cap them all
Theres nothing hidden in your head
The Sorting Hat cant see
So try me on and I will tell you
Where you ought to be
You might belong in Gryffindor
Where dwell the brave at heart
Their daring nerve and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart
