Hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
them next to the bakers He eyed them angrily as he passed He didnt
know why but they made him uneasy This bunch were whispering
excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin It was on
his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he
caught a few words of what they were saying
The Potters thats right thats what I heard yes their son Harry
Mr Dursley stopped dead Fear flooded him He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better
of it
He dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his
secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost

receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was
being stupid Potter wasnt such an unusual name He was sure there were

seen the boy It might have been Harvey Or Harold There was no point

sister He didnt blame her  if hed had a sister like that but all

He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and
when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that
he walked straight into someone just outside the door
Sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell It
was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realized that the man was wearing a
violet cloak He didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the
ground On the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in
a squeaky voice that made passersby stare Dont be sorry my dear sir
for nothing could upset me today Rejoice for YouKnowWho has gone at
last Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy
happy day
And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off
Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot He had been hugged by a complete
stranger He also thought he had been called a Muggle whatever that
was He was rattled He hurried to his car and set off for home hoping
