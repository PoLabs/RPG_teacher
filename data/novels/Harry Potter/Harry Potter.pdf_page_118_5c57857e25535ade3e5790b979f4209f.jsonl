No shouted Hermione Granger Madam Hooch told us not to move 
youll get us all into trouble
Harry ignored her Blood was pounding in his ears He mounted the broom
and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed
through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of
fierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being
taught  this was easy this was wonderful He pulled his broomstick up
a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls
back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair Malfoy looked
stunned
Give it here Harry called or Ill knock you off that broom Oh
yeah said Malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried
Harry knew somehow what to do He leaned forward and grasped the broom
tightly in both hands and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin Malfoy
only just got out of the way in time Harry made a sharp aboutface and
held the broom steady A few people below were clapping
No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck Malfoy Harry called
The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy
Catch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball
high into the air and streaked back toward the ground
Harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and
then start to fall He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down
 next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball
 wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people
watching  he stretched out his hand  a foot from the ground he
caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled
gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist
HARRY POTTER
His heart sank faster than hed just dived Professor McGonagall was
running toward them He got to his feet trembling
Never  in all my time at Hogwarts
