broomstick Come on hurry up
Harry glanced down at his broom It was old and some of the twigs stuck
out at odd angles
Stick out your right hand over your broom called Madam Hooch at the
front and say Up
UPF everyone shouted
Harrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few
that did Hermione Grangers had simply rolled over on the ground and
Nevilles hadnt moved at all Perhaps brooms like horses could tell
when you were afraid thought Harry there was a quaver in Nevilles
voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the
ground
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding
off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips
Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy hed been doing it
wrong for years
Now when I blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said
Madam Hooch Keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come
straight back down by leaning forward slightly On my whistle  three
 two 
But Neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the
ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hoochs
lips
Come back boy she shouted but Neville was rising straight up like a
cork shot out of a bottle  twelve feet  twenty feet Harry saw his
scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp
slip sideways off the broom and 
WHAM  a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass
in a heap His broomstick was still rising higher and higher and
started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville her face as white as his
Broken wrist Harry heard her mutter Come on boy  its all right
