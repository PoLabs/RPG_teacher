down the corridor outside  stuffing the shrieking book back on the
shelf he ran for it He passed Filch in the doorway Filchs pale wild
eyes looked straight through him and Harry slipped under Filchs
outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the books shrieks
still ringing in his ears
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor He had been
so busy getting away from the library he hadnt paid attention to where
he was going Perhaps because it was dark he didnt recognize where he
was at all There was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he

It was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold
frame standing on two clawed feet There was an inscription carved
around the top Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi His panic
