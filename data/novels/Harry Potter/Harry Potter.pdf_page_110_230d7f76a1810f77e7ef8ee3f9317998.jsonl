eh Potter Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those
cold eyes He had looked through his books at the Dursleys but did
Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs
and Fungi
Snape was still ignoring Hermiones quivering hand
What is the difference Potter between monkshood and wolfsbane
At this Hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon
ceiling
I dont know said Harry quietly I think Hermione does though why
dont you try her
A few people laughed Harry caught Seamuss eye and Seamus winked
Snape however was not pleased
Sit down he snapped at Hermione For your information Potter
asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as
the Draught of Living Death A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach
of a goat and it will save you from most poisons As for monkshood and
wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of
aconite Well Why arent you all copying that down
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment Over the noise
Snape said And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your
cheek Potter
Things didnt improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson
continued Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a
simple potion to cure boils He swept around in his long black cloak
watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing
almost everyone except Malfoy whom he seemed to like He was just
telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned
slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the
dungeon Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamuss cauldron into a
twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor
burning holes in peoples shoes Within seconds the whole class was
standing on their stools while Neville who had been drenched in the
potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils
sprang up all over his arms and legs
