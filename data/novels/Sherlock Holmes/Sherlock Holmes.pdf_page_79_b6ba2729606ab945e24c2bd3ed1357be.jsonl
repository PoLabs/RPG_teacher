The Man with the Twisted Lip
He only as I understand gave an inarticulate
cry
Yes
A call for help you thought
Yes He waved his hands
But it might have been a cry of surprise Aston
ishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause
him to throw up his hands
It is possible
And you thought he was pulled back
He disappeared so suddenly
He might have leaped back You did not see
anyone else in the room
No but this horrible man confessed to having
been there and the Lascar was at the foot of the
stairs
Quite so Your husband as far as you could see
had his ordinary clothes on
But without his collar or tie I distinctly saw his
bare throat
Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane
Never
Had he ever showed any signs of having taken
opium
Never
Thank you Mrs St Clair Those are the principal
points about which I wished to be absolutely clear
We shall now have a little supper and then retire for
we may have a very busy day tomorrow
A large and comfortable doublebedded room had
been placed at our disposal and I was quickly be
tween the sheets for I was weary after my night of
adventure Sherlock Holmes was a man however
who when he had an unsolved problem upon his
mind would go for days and even for a week with
out rest turning it over rearranging his facts looking
at it from every point of view until he had either
fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were
insufcient It was soon evident to me that he was
now preparing for an allnight sitting He took off
his coat and waistcoat put on a large blue dressing
gown and then wandered about the room collecting
pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and
armchairs With these he constructed a sort of Eastern
divan upon which he perched himself crosslegged
with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches
laid out in front of him In the dim light of the lamp I
saw him sitting there an old briar pipe between his
lips his eyes xed vacantly upon the corner of the
ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him silent
motionless with the light shining upon his strongset
aquiline features So he sat as I dropped off to sleep
and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me
to wake up and I found the summer sun shining into
the apartment The pipe was still between his lips the
smoke still curled upward and the room was full of a
dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap
of shag which I had seen upon the previous night
Awake Watson he asked
Yes
Game for a morning drive
Certainly
Then dress No one is stirring yet but I know
where the stableboy sleeps and we shall soon have
the trap out He chuckled to himself as he spoke his
eyes twinkled and he seemed a different man to the
sombre thinker of the previous night
As I dressed I glanced at my watch It was no
wonder that no one was stirring It was twentyve
minutes past four I had hardly nished when Holmes
returned with the news that the boy was putting in
the horse
I want to test a little theory of mine said he
pulling on his boots I think Watson that you are
now standing in the presence of one of the most ab
solute fools in Europe I deserve to be kicked from
here to Charing Cross But I think I have the key of
the affair now
And where is it I asked smiling
In the bathroom he answered
Oh yes I
am not joking he continued seeing my look of in
credulity I have just been there and I have taken it
out and I have got it in this Gladstone bag Come on
my boy and we shall see whether it will not t the
lock
We made our way downstairs as quietly as pos
sible and out into the bright morning sunshine In
the road stood our horse and trap with the halfclad
stableboy waiting at the head We both sprang in
and away we dashed down the London Road A few
country carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to
the metropolis but the lines of villas on either side
were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream
It has been in some points a singular case said
Holmes icking the horse on into a gallop I confess
that I have been as blind as a mole but it is better to
learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all
In town the earliest risers were just beginning to
look sleepily from their windows as we drove through
