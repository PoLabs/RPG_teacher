A Scandal in Bohemia
And why
Because she has said that she would send it on
the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed
That will be next Monday
Oh then we have three days yet said Holmes
with a yawn That is very fortunate as I have one or
two matters of importance to look into just at present
Your Majesty will of course stay in London for the
present
Certainly You will nd me at the Langham under
the name of the Count Von Kramm
Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how
we progress
Pray do so I shall be all anxiety
Then as to money
You have carte blanche
Absolutely
I tell you that I would give one of the provinces
of my kingdom to have that photograph
And for present expenses
The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from
under his cloak and laid it on the table
There are three hundred pounds in gold and
seven hundred in notes he said
Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his
notebook and handed it to him
And Mademoiselles address he asked
Is Briony Lodge Serpentine Avenue St Johns
Wood
Holmes took a note of it One other question
said he Was the photograph a cabinet
It was
Then goodnight your Majesty and I trust that
we shall soon have some good news for you And
goodnight Watson he added as the wheels of the
royal brougham rolled down the street If you will
be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three
oclock I should like to chat this little matter over with
you
CHAPTER II
At three oclock precisely I was at Baker Street
but Holmes had not yet returned The landlady in
formed me that he had left the house shortly after
eight oclock in the morning I sat down beside the
re however with the intention of awaiting him how
ever long he might be I was already deeply inter
ested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded
by none of the grim and strange features which were
associated with the two crimes which I have already
recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted
station of his client gave it a character of its own In
deed apart from the nature of the investigation which
my friend had on hand there was something in his
masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive
reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study
his system of work and to follow the quick subtle
methods by which he disentangled the most inextrica
ble mysteries So accustomed was I to his invariable
success that the very possibility of his failing had
ceased to enter into my head
It was close upon four before the door opened
and a drunkenlooking groom illkempt and side
whiskered with an inamed face and disreputable
clothes walked into the room Accustomed as I was
to my friends amazing powers in the use of disguises
I had to look three times before I was certain that
it was indeed he With a nod he vanished into the
bedroom whence he emerged in ve minutes tweed
suited and respectable as of old Putting his hands
into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of
the re and laughed heartily for some minutes
Well really he cried and then he choked and
laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp
and helpless in the chair
What is it
Its quite too funny I am sure you could never
guess how I employed my morning or what I ended
by doing
I cant imagine I suppose that you have been
watching the habits and perhaps the house of Miss
Irene Adler
