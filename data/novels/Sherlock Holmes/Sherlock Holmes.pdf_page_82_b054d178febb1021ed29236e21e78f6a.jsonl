The Man with the Twisted Lip
her voice downstairs but I knew that she could not
ascend Swiftly I threw off my clothes pulled on
those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig
Even a wifes eyes could not pierce so complete a
disguise But then it occurred to me that there might
be a search in the room and that the clothes might
betray me I threw open the window reopening by
my violence a small cut which I had inicted upon
myself in the bedroom that morning Then I seized
my coat which was weighted by the coppers which I
had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which
I carried my takings I hurled it out of the window
and it disappeared into the Thames The other clothes
would have followed but at that moment there was
a rush of constables up the stair and a few minutes
after I found rather I confess to my relief that in
stead of being identied as Mr Neville St Clair I was
arrested as his murderer
I do not know that there is anything else for me
to explain I was determined to preserve my disguise
as long as possible and hence my preference for a
dirty face Knowing that my wife would be terribly
anxious I slipped off my ring and conded it to the
Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching
me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that
she had no cause to fear
That note only reached her yesterday said
Holmes
Good God What a week she must have spent
The police have watched this Lascar said In
spector Bradstreet and I can quite understand that
he might nd it difcult to post a letter unobserved
Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his
who forgot all about it for some days
That was it said Holmes nodding approvingly
I have no doubt of it But have you never been prose
cuted for begging
Many times but what was a ne to me
It must stop here however said Bradstreet If
the police are to hush this thing up there must be no
more of Hugh Boone
I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which
a man can take
In that case I think that it is probable that no fur
ther steps may be taken But if you are found again
then all must come out I am sure Mr Holmes that
we are very much indebted to you for having cleared
the matter up I wish I knew how you reach your
results
I reached this one said my friend by sitting
upon ve pillows and consuming an ounce of shag
I think Watson that if we drive to Baker Street we
shall just be in time for breakfast
