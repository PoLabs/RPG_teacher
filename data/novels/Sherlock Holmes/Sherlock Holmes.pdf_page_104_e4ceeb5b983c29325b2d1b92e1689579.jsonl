The Adventure of the Speckled Band
And the lady I fancy is Miss Stoner observed
Holmes shading his eyes Yes I think we had better
do as you suggest
We got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back
on its way to Leatherhead
I thought it as well said Holmes as we climbed
the stile that this fellow should think we had come
here as architects or on some denite business It
may stop his gossip Goodafternoon Miss Stoner
You see that we have been as good as our word
Our client of the morning had hurried forward to
meet us with a face which spoke her joy I have been
waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands
with us warmly All has turned out splendidly Dr
Roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he
will be back before evening
We have had the pleasure of making the doctors
acquaintance said Holmes and in a few words he
sketched out what had occurred Miss Stoner turned
white to the lips as she listened
Good heavens she cried he has followed me
then
So it appears
He is so cunning that I never know when I am
safe from him What will he say when he returns
He must guard himself for he may nd that there
is someone more cunning than himself upon his track
You must lock yourself up from him tonight If he
is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at
Harrow Now we must make the best use of our time
so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are
to examine
The building was of grey lichenblotched stone
with a high central portion and two curving wings
like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side In
one of these wings the windows were broken and
blocked with wooden boards while the roof was
partly caved in a picture of ruin The central por
tion was in little better repair but the righthand
block was comparatively modern and the blinds in
the windows with the blue smoke curling up from
the chimneys showed that this was where the family
resided Some scaffolding had been erected against
the end wall and the stonework had been broken
into but there were no signs of any workmen at the
moment of our visit Holmes walked slowly up and
down the illtrimmed lawn and examined with deep
attention the outsides of the windows
This I take it belongs to the room in which you
used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and
the one next to the main building to Dr Roylotts
chamber
Exactly so But I am now sleeping in the middle
one
Pending the alterations as I understand By the
way there does not seem to be any very pressing need
for repairs at that end wall
There were none I believe that it was an excuse
to move me from my room
Ah that is suggestive Now on the other side
of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which
these three rooms open There are windows in it of
course
Yes but very small ones Too narrow for anyone
to pass through
As you both locked your doors at night your
rooms were unapproachable from that side Now
would you have the kindness to go into your room
and bar your shutters
Miss Stoner did so and Holmes after a careful
examination through the open window endeavoured
in every way to force the shutter open but without
success There was no slit through which a knife
could be passed to raise the bar Then with his lens
he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built
rmly into the massive masonry Hum said he
scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory
certainly presents some difculties No one could
pass these shutters if they were bolted Well we shall
see if the inside throws any light upon the matter
A small side door led into the whitewashed corri
dor from which the three bedrooms opened Holmes
refused to examine the third chamber so we passed
at once to the second that in which Miss Stoner was
now sleeping and in which her sister had met with
her fate It was a homely little room with a low ceil
ing and a gaping replace after the fashion of old
countryhouses A brown chest of drawers stood in
one corner a narrow whitecounterpaned bed in an
other and a dressingtable on the lefthand side of the
window These articles with two small wickerwork
chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for
a square of Wilton carpet in the centre The boards
round and the panelling of the walls were of brown
wormeaten oak so old and discoloured that it may
have dated from the original building of the house
Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat
silent while his eyes travelled round and round and
up and down taking in every detail of the apartment
Where does that bell communicate with he
asked at last pointing to a thick bellrope which hung
