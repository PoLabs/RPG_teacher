A Scandal in Bohemia
parallel cuts Obviously they have been caused by
someone who has very carelessly scraped round the
edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud
from it Hence you see my double deduction that
you had been out in vile weather and that you had a
particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the
London slavey As to your practice if a gentleman
walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a
black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right foren
ger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to
show where he has secreted his stethoscope I must
be dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be an
active member of the medical profession
I could not help laughing at the ease with which
he explained his process of deduction When I hear
you give your reasons I remarked the thing always
appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could
easily do it myself though at each successive instance
of your reasoning I am bafed until you explain your
process And yet I believe that my eyes are as good
as yours
Quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and
throwing himself down into an armchair You see
but you do not observe The distinction is clear For
example you have frequently seen the steps which
lead up from the hall to this room
Frequently
How often
Well some hundreds of times
Then how many are there
How many I dont know
Quite so You have not observed And yet you
have seen That is just my point Now I know that
there are seventeen steps because I have both seen
and observed Bytheway since you are interested in
these little problems and since you are good enough
to chronicle one or two of my triing experiences you
may be interested in this He threw over a sheet of
thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying
open upon the table It came by the last post said
he Read it aloud
The note was undated and without either signa
ture or address
There will call upon you tonight at a quarter to
eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to
consult you upon a matter of the very deepest mo
ment Your recent services to one of the royal houses
of Europe have shown that you are one who may
safely be trusted with matters which are of an impor
tance which can hardly be exaggerated This account
of you we have from all quarters received Be in your
chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if
your visitor wear a mask
This is indeed a mystery I remarked What do
you imagine that it means
I have no data yet It is a capital mistake to the
orize before one has data Insensibly one begins to
twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit
facts But the note itself What do you deduce from
it
I carefully examined the writing and the paper
upon which it was written
The man who wrote it was presumably well to
do I remarked endeavouring to imitate my com
panions processes Such paper could not be bought
under half a crown a packet It is peculiarly strong
and stiff
Peculiarthat is the very word said Holmes
It is not an English paper at all Hold it up to the
light
I did so and saw a large E with a small g a
P and a large G with a small t woven into the
texture of the paper
What do you make of that asked Holmes
The name of the maker no doubt or his mono
gram rather
Not at all The G with the small t stands for
Gesellschaft which is the German for Company
It is a customary contraction like our Co P of
course stands for Papier Now for the Eg Let us
glance at our Continental Gazetteer He took down
a heavy brown volume from his shelves
Eglow
Eglonitzhere we are Egria
It is in a German
speaking countryin Bohemia not far from Carls
bad Remarkable as being the scene of the death of
Wallenstein and for its numerous glassfactories and
papermills Ha ha my boy what do you make of
that His eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue
triumphant cloud from his cigarette
The paper was made in Bohemia I said
Precisely And the man who wrote the note is
a German Do you note the peculiar construction of
the sentenceThis account of you we have from all
quarters received A Frenchman or Russian could
not have written that It is the German who is so un
courteous to his verbs It only remains therefore to
discover what is wanted by this German who writes
upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask
to showing his face And here he comes if I am not
mistaken to resolve all our doubts
