The Adventure of the Copper Beeches
Excellent We shall then look thoroughly into
the affair Of course there is only one feasible expla
nation You have been brought there to personate
someone and the real person is imprisoned in this
chamber That is obvious As to who this prisoner
is I have no doubt that it is the daughter Miss Al
ice Rucastle if I remember right who was said to
have gone to America You were chosen doubtless
as resembling her in height gure and the colour
of your hair Hers had been cut off very possibly in
some illness through which she has passed and so of
course yours had to be sacriced also By a curious
chance you came upon her tresses The man in the
road was undoubtedly some friend of herspossibly
her anceand no doubt as you wore the girls dress
and were so like her he was convinced from your
laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from
your gesture that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy
and that she no longer desired his attentions The dog
is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring
to communicate with her So much is fairly clear The
most serious point in the case is the disposition of the
child
What on earth has that to do with it I ejacu
lated
My dear Watson you as a medical man are con
tinually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child
by the study of the parents Dont you see that the
converse is equally valid I have frequently gained
my rst real insight into the character of parents by
studying their children This childs disposition is ab
normally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether
he derives this from his smiling father as I should
suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor
girl who is in their power
I am sure that you are right Mr Holmes cried
our client
A thousand things come back to me
which make me certain that you have hit it Oh let
us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor
creature
We must be circumspect for we are dealing with
a very cunning man We can do nothing until seven
oclock At that hour we shall be with you and it will
not be long before we solve the mystery
We were as good as our word for it was just seven
when we reached the Copper Beeches having put
up our trap at a wayside publichouse The group of
trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished
metal in the light of the setting sun were sufcient
to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been
standing smiling on the doorstep
Have you managed it asked Holmes
A loud thudding noise came from somewhere
downstairs That is Mrs Toller in the cellar said
she Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug
Here are his keys which are the duplicates of Mr
Rucastles
You have done well indeed cried Holmes with
enthusiasm Now lead the way and we shall soon
see the end of this black business
We passed up the stair unlocked the door fol
lowed on down a passage and found ourselves in
front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had de
scribed Holmes cut the cord and removed the trans
verse bar Then he tried the various keys in the lock
but without success No sound came from within
and at the silence Holmes face clouded over
I trust that we are not too late said he I think
Miss Hunter that we had better go in without you
Now Watson put your shoulder to it and we shall
see whether we cannot make our way in
It was an old rickety door and gave at once be
fore our united strength Together we rushed into the
room It was empty There was no furniture save a
little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen
The skylight above was open and the prisoner gone
There has been some villainy here said Holmes
this beauty has guessed Miss Hunters intentions
and has carried his victim off
But how
Through the skylight We shall soon see how
he managed it He swung himself up onto the roof
Ah yes he cried heres the end of a long light
ladder against the eaves That is how he did it
But it is impossible said Miss Hunter the lad
der was not there when the Rucastles went away
He has come back and done it I tell you that he
is a clever and dangerous man I should not be very
much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now
upon the stair I think Watson that it would be as
well for you to have your pistol ready
The words were hardly out of his mouth before
a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat
and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand Miss
Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the
sight of him but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward
and confronted him
You villain said he wheres your daughter
The fat man cast his eyes round and then up at
the open skylight
It is for me to ask you that he shrieked you
thieves Spies and thieves I have caught you have I
