A Case of Identity
and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to
come at any rate she would not listen to another man
As far as the church door he brought her and then
as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished
away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a
fourwheeler and out at the other I think that was
the chain of events Mr Windibank
Our visitor had recovered something of his assur
ance while Holmes had been talking and he rose
from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale
face
It may be so or it may not Mr Holmes said he
but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp
enough to know that it is you who are breaking the
law now and not me I have done nothing action
able from the rst but as long as you keep that door
locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault
and illegal constraint
The law cannot as you say touch you said
Holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet
there never was a man who deserved punishment
more If the young lady has a brother or a friend he
ought to lay a whip across your shoulders By Jove
he continued ushing up at the sight of the bitter
sneer upon the mans face it is not part of my duties
to my client but heres a hunting crop handy and I
think I shall just treat myself to He took two swift
steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there
was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy
hall door banged and from the window we could see
Mr James Windibank running at the top of his speed
down the road
Theres a coldblooded scoundrel said Holmes
laughing as he threw himself down into his chair
once more That fellow will rise from crime to crime
until he does something very bad and ends on a gal
lows The case has in some respects been not entirely
devoid of interest
I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your
reasoning I remarked
Well of course it was obvious from the rst that
this Mr Hosmer Angel must have some strong object
for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that
the only man who really proted by the incident as
far as we could see was the stepfather Then the fact
that the two men were never together but that the
one always appeared when the other was away was
suggestive So were the tinted spectacles and the curi
ous voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the
bushy whiskers My suspicions were all conrmed
by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature
which of course inferred that his handwriting was
so familiar to her that she would recognise even the
smallest sample of it You see all these isolated facts
together with many minor ones all pointed in the
same direction
And how did you verify them
Having once spotted my man it was easy to
get corroboration I knew the rm for which this
man worked Having taken the printed description
I eliminated everything from it which could be the
result of a disguisethe whiskers the glasses the
voice and I sent it to the rm with a request that
they would inform me whether it answered to the
description of any of their travellers I had already
noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and I wrote
to the man himself at his business address asking him
if he would come here As I expected his reply was
typewritten and revealed the same trivial but char
acteristic defects The same post brought me a letter
from Westhouse  Marbank of Fenchurch Street to
say that the description tallied in every respect with
that of their employee James Windibank Voila tout
And Miss Sutherland
If I tell her she will not believe me You may
remember the old Persian saying There is danger
for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for
whoso snatches a delusion from a woman There is
as much sense in Haz as in Horace and as much
knowledge of the world
