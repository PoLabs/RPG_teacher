The Boscombe Valley Mystery
of importance Good has come out of evil however
for the barmaid nding from the papers that he is in
serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown
him over utterly and has written to him to say that
she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard
so that there is really no tie between them I think
that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy
for all that he has suffered
But if he is innocent who has done it
Ah who I would call your attention very partic
ularly to two points One is that the murdered man
had an appointment with someone at the pool and
that the someone could not have been his son for his
son was away and he did not know when he would
return The second is that the murdered man was
heard to cry Cooee before he knew that his son had
returned Those are the crucial points upon which
the case depends And now let us talk about George
Meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor
matters until tomorrow
There was no rain as Holmes had foretold and
the morning broke bright and cloudless
At nine
oclock Lestrade called for us with the carriage and
we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool
There is serious news this morning Lestrade
observed It is said that Mr Turner of the Hall is so
ill that his life is despaired of
An elderly man I presume said Holmes
About sixty but his constitution has been shat
tered by his life abroad and he has been in failing
health for some time This business has had a very
bad effect upon him He was an old friend of Mc
Carthys and I may add a great benefactor to him
for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm
rent free
Indeed That is interesting said Holmes
Oh yes In a hundred other ways he has helped
him Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to
him
Really Does it not strike you as a little singular
that this McCarthy who appears to have had little
of his own and to have been under such obligations
to Turner should still talk of marrying his son to
Turners daughter who is presumably heiress to the
estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if
it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would
follow It is the more strange since we know that
Turner himself was averse to the idea The daughter
told us as much Do you not deduce something from
that
We have got to the deductions and the infer
ences said Lestrade winking at me I nd it hard
enough to tackle facts Holmes without ying away
after theories and fancies
You are right said Holmes demurely you do
nd it very hard to tackle the facts
Anyhow I have grasped one fact which you seem
to nd it difcult to get hold of replied Lestrade with
some warmth
And that is
That McCarthy senior met his death from Mc
Carthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are
the merest moonshine
Well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog
said Holmes laughing But I am very much mis
taken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left
Yes that is it It was a widespread comfortable
looking building twostoried slateroofed with great
yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls The
drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however
gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this
horror still lay heavy upon it We called at the door
when the maid at Holmes request showed us the
boots which her master wore at the time of his death
and also a pair of the sons though not the pair which
he had then had Having measured these very care
fully from seven or eight different points Holmes
desired to be led to the courtyard from which we all
followed the winding track which led to Boscombe
Pool
Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was
hot upon such a scent as this Men who had only
known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street
would have failed to recognise him His face ushed
and darkened His brows were drawn into two hard
black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath
them with a steely glitter His face was bent down
ward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and
the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy
neck His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely ani
mal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely
concentrated upon the matter before him that a ques
tion or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the
most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply
Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track
which ran through the meadows and so by way of the
woods to the Boscombe Pool It was damp marshy
ground as is all that district and there were marks
of many feet both upon the path and amid the short
grass which bounded it on either side Sometimes
Holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and
once he made quite a little detour into the meadow
