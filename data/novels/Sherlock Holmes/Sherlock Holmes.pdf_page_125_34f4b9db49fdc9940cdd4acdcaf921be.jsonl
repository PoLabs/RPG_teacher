The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor
Was UnderSecretary for the colonies in a late admin
istration The Duke his father was at one time Sec
retary for Foreign Affairs They inherit Plantagenet
blood by direct descent and Tudor on the distaff side
Ha Well there is nothing very instructive in all this
I think that I must turn to you Watson for something
more solid
I have very little difculty in nding what I want
said I for the facts are quite recent and the matter
struck me as remarkable I feared to refer them to you
however as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand
and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters
Oh you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor
Square furniture van
That is quite cleared up
nowthough indeed it was obvious from the rst
Pray give me the results of your newspaper selec
tions
Here is the rst notice which I can nd It is in
the personal column of the Morning Post and dates
as you see some weeks back
 A marriage has been arranged it says and
will if rumour is correct very shortly take
place between Lord Robert St Simon second
son of the Duke of Balmoral and Miss Hatty
Doran the only daughter of Aloysius Doran
Esq of San Francisco Cal USA
That is all
Terse and to the point remarked Holmes
stretching his long thin legs towards the re
There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of
the society papers of the same week Ah here it is
 There will soon be a call for protection in
the marriage market for the present freetrade
principle appears to tell heavily against our
home product One by one the management
of the noble houses of Great Britain is pass
ing into the hands of our fair cousins from
across the Atlantic
An important addition
has been made during the last week to the
list of the prizes which have been borne away
by these charming invaders Lord St Simon
who has shown himself for over twenty years
proof against the little gods arrows has now
denitely announced his approaching mar
riage with Miss Hatty Doran the fascinating
daughter of a California millionaire Miss Do
ran whose graceful gure and striking face at
tracted much attention at the Westbury House
festivities is an only child and it is currently
reported that her dowry will run to consider
ably over the six gures with expectancies for
the future As it is an open secret that the
Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell
his pictures within the last few years and as
Lord St Simon has no property of his own
save the small estate of Birchmoor it is obvi
ous that the Californian heiress is not the only
gainer by an alliance which will enable her to
make the easy and common transition from a
Republican lady to a British peeress 
Anything else asked Holmes yawning
Oh yes plenty Then there is another note in
the Morning Post to say that the marriage would
be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at St
Georges Hanover Square that only half a dozen in
timate friends would be invited and that the party
would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate
which has been taken by Mr Aloysius Doran Two
days laterthat is on Wednesday lastthere is a
curt announcement that the wedding had taken place
and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord
Backwaters place near Peterseld Those are all the
notices which appeared before the disappearance of
the bride
Before the what asked Holmes with a start
The vanishing of the lady
When did she vanish then
At the wedding breakfast
Indeed This is more interesting than it promised
to be quite dramatic in fact
Yes it struck me as being a little out of the com
mon
They often vanish before the ceremony and occa
sionally during the honeymoon but I cannot call to
mind anything quite so prompt as this Pray let me
have the details
I warn you that they are very incomplete
Perhaps we may make them less so
Such as they are they are set forth in a single
article of a morning paper of yesterday which I will
read to you It is headed Singular Occurrence at a
Fashionable Wedding
 The family of Lord Robert St Simon has
been thrown into the greatest consternation by
the strange and painful episodes which have
taken place in connection with his wedding
The ceremony as shortly announced in the
papers of yesterday occurred on the previous
morning but it is only now that it has been
possible to conrm the strange rumours which
have been so persistently oating about In
spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the
