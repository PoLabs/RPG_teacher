The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle
I had a friend once called Maudsley who went
to the bad and has just been serving his time in Pen
tonville One day he had met me and fell into talk
about the ways of thieves and how they could get
rid of what they stole I knew that he would be true
to me for I knew one or two things about him so I
made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn where
he lived and take him into my condence He would
show me how to turn the stone into money But how
to get to him in safety I thought of the agonies I had
gone through in coming from the hotel I might at
any moment be seized and searched and there would
be the stone in my waistcoat pocket I was leaning
against the wall at the time and looking at the geese
which were waddling about round my feet and sud
denly an idea came into my head which showed me
how I could beat the best detective that ever lived
My sister had told me some weeks before that
I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas
present and I knew that she was always as good as
her word I would take my goose now and in it I
would carry my stone to Kilburn There was a little
shed in the yard and behind this I drove one of the
birdsa ne big one white with a barred tail I
caught it and prying its bill open I thrust the stone
down its throat as far as my nger could reach The
bird gave a gulp and I felt the stone pass along its gul
let and down into its crop But the creature apped
and struggled and out came my sister to know what
was the matter As I turned to speak to her the brute
broke loose and uttered off among the others
 Whatever were you doing with that bird Jem
says she
 Well said I you said youd give me one for
Christmas and I was feeling which was the fattest
 Oh says she weve set yours aside for
youJems bird we call it Its the big white one
over yonder Theres twentysix of them which makes
one for you and one for us and two dozen for the
market
 Thank you Maggie says I but if it is all the
same to you Id rather have that one I was handling
just now
 The other is a good three pound heavier said
she and we fattened it expressly for you
 Never mind Ill have the other and Ill take it
now said I
 Oh just as you like said she a little huffed
Which is it you want then
 That white one with the barred tail right in the
middle of the ock
 Oh very well Kill it and take it with you
Well I did what she said Mr Holmes and I car
ried the bird all the way to Kilburn I told my pal
what I had done for he was a man that it was easy to
tell a thing like that to He laughed until he choked
and we got a knife and opened the goose My heart
turned to water for there was no sign of the stone
and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred
I left the bird rushed back to my sisters and hurried
into the back yard There was not a bird to be seen
there
 Where are they all Maggie I cried
 Gone to the dealers Jem
 Which dealers
 Breckinridge of Covent Garden
 But was there another with a barred tail I
asked the same as the one I chose
 Yes Jem there were two barredtailed ones and
I could never tell them apart
Well then of course I saw it all and I ran off as
hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breck
inridge but he had sold the lot at once and not one
word would he tell me as to where they had gone
You heard him yourselves tonight Well he has al
ways answered me like that My sister thinks that
I am going mad Sometimes I think that I am my
self And nowand now I am myself a branded thief
without ever having touched the wealth for which I
sold my character God help me God help me He
burst into convulsive sobbing with his face buried in
his hands
There was a long silence broken only by his heavy
breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock
Holmes ngertips upon the edge of the table Then
my friend rose and threw open the door
Get out said he
What sir Oh Heaven bless you
No more words Get out
And no more words were needed There was a
rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and
the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street
After all Watson said Holmes reaching up his
hand for his clay pipe I am not retained by the po
lice to supply their deciencies If Horner were in
danger it would be another thing but this fellow will
not appear against him and the case must collapse I
suppose that I am commuting a felony but it is just
possible that I am saving a soul This fellow will not
go wrong again he is too terribly frightened Send
him to jail now and you make him a jailbird for life
