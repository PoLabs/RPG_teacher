The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet
But what other is there cried the banker with
a gesture of despair If his motives were innocent
why does he not explain them
It is our task to nd that out replied Holmes
so now if you please Mr Holder we will set off for
Streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a
little more closely into details
My friend insisted upon my accompanying them
in their expedition which I was eager enough to do
for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred
by the story to which we had listened I confess that
the guilt of the bankers son appeared to me to be as
obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still I had
such faith in Holmes judgment that I felt that there
must be some grounds for hope as long as he was
dissatised with the accepted explanation He hardly
spoke a word the whole way out to the southern sub
urb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his
hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought
Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the
little glimpse of hope which had been presented to
him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me
over his business affairs A short railway journey and
a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank the modest
residence of the great nancier
Fairbank was a goodsized square house of white
stone standing back a little from the road A dou
ble carriagesweep with a snowclad lawn stretched
down in front to two large iron gates which closed
the entrance On the right side was a small wooden
thicket which led into a narrow path between two
neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen
door and forming the tradesmens entrance On the
left ran a lane which led to the stables and was not
itself within the grounds at all being a public though
little used thoroughfare Holmes left us standing
at the door and walked slowly all round the house
across the front down the tradesmens path and
so round by the garden behind into the stable lane
So long was he that Mr Holder and I went into the
diningroom and waited by the re until he should
return We were sitting there in silence when the door
opened and a young lady came in She was rather
above the middle height slim with dark hair and
eyes which seemed the darker against the absolute
pallor of her skin I do not think that I have ever seen
such deadly paleness in a womans face Her lips too
were bloodless but her eyes were ushed with crying
As she swept silently into the room she impressed me
with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done
in the morning and it was the more striking in her as
she was evidently a woman of strong character with
immense capacity for selfrestraint Disregarding my
presence she went straight to her uncle and passed
her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress
You have given orders that Arthur should be
liberated have you not dad she asked
No no my girl the matter must be probed to
the bottom
But I am so sure that he is innocent You know
what womans instincts are I know that he has done
no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted
so harshly
Why is he silent then if he is innocent
Who knows Perhaps because he was so angry
that you should suspect him
How could I help suspecting him when I actually
saw him with the coronet in his hand
Oh but he had only picked it up to look at it Oh
do do take my word for it that he is innocent Let
the matter drop and say no more It is so dreadful to
think of our dear Arthur in a prison
I shall never let it drop until the gems are
foundnever Mary Your affection for Arthur blinds
you as to the awful consequences to me Far from
hushing the thing up I have brought a gentleman
down from London to inquire more deeply into it
This gentleman she asked facing round to me
No his friend He wished us to leave him alone
He is round in the stable lane now
The stable lane She raised her dark eyebrows
What can he hope to nd there Ah this I suppose
is he I trust sir that you will succeed in proving
what I feel sure is the truth that my cousin Arthur is
innocent of this crime
I fully share your opinion and I trust with you
that we may prove it returned Holmes going back to
the mat to knock the snow from his shoes I believe
I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder
Might I ask you a question or two
Pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible
affair up
You heard nothing yourself last night
Nothing until my uncle here began to speak
loudly I heard that and I came down
You shut up the windows and doors the night
before Did you fasten all the windows
Yes
Were they all fastened this morning
Yes
