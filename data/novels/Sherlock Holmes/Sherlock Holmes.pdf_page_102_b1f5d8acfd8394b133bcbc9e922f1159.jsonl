The Adventure of the Speckled Band
Miss Roylott you have not You are screening
your stepfather
Why what do you mean
For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black
lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visi
tors knee Five little livid spots the marks of four
ngers and a thumb were printed upon the white
wrist
You have been cruelly used said Holmes
The lady coloured deeply and covered over her
injured wrist He is a hard man she said and
perhaps he hardly knows his own strength
There was a long silence during which Holmes
leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the
crackling re
This is a very deep business he said at last
There are a thousand details which I should desire
to know before I decide upon our course of action
Yet we have not a moment to lose If we were to come
to Stoke Moran today would it be possible for us to
see over these rooms without the knowledge of your
stepfather
As it happens he spoke of coming into town
today upon some most important business
It is
probable that he will be away all day and that there
would be nothing to disturb you We have a house
keeper now but she is old and foolish and I could
easily get her out of the way
Excellent You are not averse to this trip Wat
son
By no means
Then we shall both come What are you going to
do yourself
I have one or two things which I would wish to
do now that I am in town But I shall return by the
twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your
coming
And you may expect us early in the afternoon I
have myself some small business matters to attend to
Will you not wait and breakfast
No I must go My heart is lightened already
since I have conded my trouble to you
I shall
look forward to seeing you again this afternoon She
dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided
from the room
And what do you think of it all Watson asked
Sherlock Holmes leaning back in his chair
It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister
business
Dark enough and sinister enough
Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the ooring
and walls are sound and that the door window and
chimney are impassable then her sister must have
been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious
end
What becomes then of these nocturnal whistles
and what of the very peculiar words of the dying
woman
I cannot think
When you combine the ideas of whistles at night
the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate
terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every
reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in
preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying al
lusion to a band and nally the fact that Miss Helen
Stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been
caused by one of those metal bars that secured the
shutters falling back into its place I think that there is
good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared
along those lines
But what then did the gipsies do
I cannot imagine
I see many objections to any such theory
And so do I It is precisely for that reason that
we are going to Stoke Moran this day I want to see
whether the objections are fatal or if they may be
explained away But what in the name of the devil
The ejaculation had been drawn from my com
panion by the fact that our door had been suddenly
dashed open and that a huge man had framed him
self in the aperture His costume was a peculiar mix
ture of the professional and of the agricultural having
a black tophat a long frockcoat and a pair of high
gaiters with a huntingcrop swinging in his hand So
tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar
of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it
across from side to side A large face seared with a
thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and
marked with every evil passion was turned from one
to the other of us while his deepset bileshot eyes
and his high thin eshless nose gave him somewhat
the resemblance to a erce old bird of prey
Which of you is Holmes asked this apparition
My name sir but you have the advantage of me
said my companion quietly
I am Dr Grimesby Roylott of Stoke Moran
Indeed Doctor said Holmes blandly Pray take
a seat
