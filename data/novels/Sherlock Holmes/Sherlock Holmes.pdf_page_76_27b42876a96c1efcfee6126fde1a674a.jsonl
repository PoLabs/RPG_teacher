The Man with the Twisted Lip
name is Hugh Boone and his hideous face is one
which is familiar to every man who goes much to
the City He is a professional beggar though in or
der to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a
small trade in wax vestas Some little distance down
Threadneedle Street upon the lefthand side there
is as you may have remarked a small angle in the
wall Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat
crosslegged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap
and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity
descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon
the pavement beside him I have watched the fellow
more than once before ever I thought of making his
professional acquaintance and I have been surprised
at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time
His appearance you see is so remarkable that no
one can pass him without observing him A shock of
orange hair a pale face disgured by a horrible scar
which by its contraction has turned up the outer
edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of
very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular
contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out
from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so
too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to
any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the
passersby This is the man whom we now learn to
have been the lodger at the opium den and to have
been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we
are in quest
But a cripple said I What could he have done
singlehanded against a man in the prime of life
He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a
limp but in other respects he appears to be a pow
erful and wellnurtured man Surely your medical
experience would tell you Watson that weakness
in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional
strength in the others
Pray continue your narrative
Mrs St Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood
upon the window and she was escorted home in a
cab by the police as her presence could be of no help
to them in their investigations Inspector Barton who
had charge of the case made a very careful exami
nation of the premises but without nding anything
which threw any light upon the matter One mistake
had been made in not arresting Boone instantly as
he was allowed some few minutes during which he
might have communicated with his friend the Las
car but this fault was soon remedied and he was
seized and searched without anything being found
which could incriminate him There were it is true
some bloodstains upon his right shirtsleeve but he
pointed to his ringnger which had been cut near
the nail and explained that the bleeding came from
there adding that he had been to the window not
long before and that the stains which had been ob
served there came doubtless from the same source
He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr Neville
St Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes
in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the
police As to Mrs St Clairs assertion that she had
actually seen her husband at the window he declared
that she must have been either mad or dreaming He
was removed loudly protesting to the policestation
while the inspector remained upon the premises in
the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh
clue
And it did though they hardly found upon the
mudbank what they had feared to nd
It was
Neville St Clairs coat and not Neville St Clair
which lay uncovered as the tide receded And what
do you think they found in the pockets
I cannot imagine
No I dont think you would guess Every pocket
stuffed with pennies and halfpennies421 pennies
and 270 halfpennies It was no wonder that it had
not been swept away by the tide But a human body
is a different matter There is a erce eddy between
the wharf and the house It seemed likely enough that
the weighted coat had remained when the stripped
body had been sucked away into the river
But I understand that all the other clothes were
found in the room Would the body be dressed in a
coat alone
No sir but the facts might be met speciously
enough Suppose that this man Boone had thrust
Neville St Clair through the window there is no
human eye which could have seen the deed What
would he do then It would of course instantly strike
him that he must get rid of the telltale garments
He would seize the coat then and be in the act of
throwing it out when it would occur to him that
it would swim and not sink He has little time for
he has heard the scufe downstairs when the wife
tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already
heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are
hurrying up the street There is not an instant to be
lost He rushes to some secret hoard where he has
accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs
all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the
pockets to make sure of the coats sinking He throws
it out and would have done the same with the other
garments had not he heard the rush of steps below
