A Case of Identity
Quite an interesting study that maiden he ob
served I found her more interesting than her little
problem which by the way is rather a trite one You
will nd parallel cases if you consult my index in
Andover in 77 and there was something of the sort
at The Hague last year Old as is the idea however
there were one or two details which were new to me
But the maiden herself was most instructive
You appeared to read a good deal upon her
which was quite invisible to me I remarked
Not invisible but unnoticed Watson You did not
know where to look and so you missed all that was
important I can never bring you to realise the impor
tance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumbnails or
the great issues that may hang from a bootlace Now
what did you gather from that womans appearance
Describe it
Well she had a slatecoloured broadbrimmed
straw hat with a feather of a brickish red Her jacket
was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe
of little black jet ornaments Her dress was brown
rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple
plush at the neck and sleeves Her gloves were greyish
and were worn through at the right forenger Her
boots I didnt observe She had small round hang
ing gold earrings and a general air of being fairly
welltodo in a vulgar comfortable easygoing way
Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together
and chuckled
Pon my word Watson you are coming along
wonderfully You have really done very well indeed
It is true that you have missed everything of impor
tance but you have hit upon the method and you
have a quick eye for colour Never trust to general
impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon
details My rst glance is always at a womans sleeve
In a man it is perhaps better rst to take the knee of
the trouser As you observe this woman had plush
upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for
showing traces The double line a little above the
wrist where the typewritist presses against the table
was beautifully dened The sewingmachine of the
hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left
arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb
instead of being right across the broadest part as
this was I then glanced at her face and observing
the dint of a pincenez at either side of her nose I
ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting
which seemed to surprise her
It surprised me
But surely it was obvious I was then much sur
prised and interested on glancing down to observe
that though the boots which she was wearing were
not unlike each other they were really odd ones the
one having a slightly decorated toecap and the other
a plain one One was buttoned only in the two lower
buttons out of ve and the other at the rst third
and fth Now when you see that a young lady other
wise neatly dressed has come away from home with
odd boots halfbuttoned it is no great deduction to
say that she came away in a hurry
And what else I asked keenly interested as I
always was by my friends incisive reasoning
I noted in passing that she had written a note
before leaving home but after being fully dressed
You observed that her right glove was torn at the
forenger but you did not apparently see that both
glove and nger were stained with violet ink She
had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep
It must have been this morning or the mark would
not remain clear upon the nger All this is amus
ing though rather elementary but I must go back to
business Watson Would you mind reading me the
advertised description of Mr Hosmer Angel
I held the little printed slip to the light
Missing it said on the morning of
the fourteenth a gentleman named Hos
mer Angel
About ve ft seven in in
height strongly built sallow complex
ion black hair a little bald in the cen
tre bushy black sidewhiskers and mous
tache tinted glasses slight inrmity of
speech
Was dressed when last seen
in black frockcoat faced with silk black
waistcoat gold Albert chain and grey Har
ris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over
elasticsided boots Known to have been
employed in an ofce in Leadenhall Street
Anybody bringing
That will do said Holmes As to the letters
he continued glancing over them they are very com
monplace Absolutely no clue in them to Mr Angel
save that he quotes Balzac once There is one remark
able point however which will no doubt strike you
They are typewritten I remarked
Not only that but the signature is typewritten
Look at the neat little Hosmer Angel at the bottom
There is a date you see but no superscription except
Leadenhall Street which is rather vague The point
