The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle
evening but the stone could not be found ei
ther upon his person or in his rooms Cather
ine Cusack maid to the Countess deposed to
having heard Ryders cry of dismay on dis
covering the robbery and to having rushed
into the room where she found matters as de
scribed by the last witness Inspector Brad
street B division gave evidence as to the ar
rest of Horner who struggled frantically and
protested his innocence in the strongest terms
Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery
having been given against the prisoner the
magistrate refused to deal summarily with the
offence but referred it to the Assizes Horner
who had shown signs of intense emotion dur
ing the proceedings fainted away at the con
clusion and was carried out of court
Hum So much for the policecourt said Holmes
thoughtfully tossing aside the paper The question
for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading
from a ried jewelcase at one end to the crop of a
goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other You
see Watson our little deductions have suddenly as
sumed a much more important and less innocent
aspect Here is the stone the stone came from the
goose and the goose came from Mr Henry Baker the
gentleman with the bad hat and all the other char
acteristics with which I have bored you So now we
must set ourselves very seriously to nding this gen
tleman and ascertaining what part he has played in
this little mystery To do this we must try the sim
plest means rst and these lie undoubtedly in an
advertisement in all the evening papers If this fail I
shall have recourse to other methods
What will you say
Give me a pencil and that slip of paper Now
then Found at the corner of Goodge Street a goose
and a black felt hat Mr Henry Baker can have the
same by applying at 630 this evening at 221b Baker
Street That is clear and concise
Very But will he see it
Well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers
since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one He
was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking
the window and by the approach of Peterson that he
thought of nothing but ight but since then he must
have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him
to drop his bird Then again the introduction of
his name will cause him to see it for everyone who
knows him will direct his attention to it Here you
are Peterson run down to the advertising agency and
have this put in the evening papers
In which sir
Oh in the Globe Star Pall Mall St Jamess
Evening News Standard Echo and any others that oc
cur to you
Very well sir And this stone
Ah yes I shall keep the stone Thank you And
I say Peterson just buy a goose on your way back
and leave it here with me for we must have one to
give to this gentleman in place of the one which your
family is now devouring
When the commissionaire had gone Holmes took
up the stone and held it against the light Its a
bonny thing said he Just see how it glints and
sparkles Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime
Every good stone is They are the devils pet baits
In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand
for a bloody deed This stone is not yet twenty years
old It was found in the banks of the Amoy River
in southern China and is remarkable in having every
characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in
shade instead of ruby red In spite of its youth it
has already a sinister history There have been two
murders a vitriolthrowing a suicide and several rob
beries brought about for the sake of this fortygrain
weight of crystallised charcoal Who would think that
so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows
and the prison Ill lock it up in my strong box now
and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have
it
Do you think that this man Horner is innocent
I cannot tell
Well then do you imagine that this other one
Henry Baker had anything to do with the matter
It is I think much more likely that Henry Baker
is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that
the bird which he was carrying was of considerably
more value than if it were made of solid gold That
however I shall determine by a very simple test if we
have an answer to our advertisement
And you can do nothing until then
Nothing
In that case I shall continue my professional
round But I shall come back in the evening at the
hour you have mentioned for I should like to see the
solution of so tangled a business
Very glad to see you I dine at seven There is
a woodcock I believe By the way in view of recent
occurrences perhaps I ought to ask Mrs Hudson to
examine its crop
