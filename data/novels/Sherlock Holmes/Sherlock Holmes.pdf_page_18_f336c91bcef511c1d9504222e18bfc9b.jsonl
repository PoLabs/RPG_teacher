A Scandal in Bohemia
My dear Mr Sherlock Holmes
You really did it very well You took
me in completely Until after the alarm of
re I had not a suspicion But then when
I found how I had betrayed myself I be
gan to think I had been warned against
you months ago I had been told that if the
King employed an agent it would certainly
be you And your address had been given
me Yet with all this you made me reveal
what you wanted to know Even after I be
came suspicious I found it hard to think
evil of such a dear kind old clergyman
But you know I have been trained as an
actress myself Male costume is nothing
new to me I often take advantage of the
freedom which it gives I sent John the
coachman to watch you ran up stairs got
into my walkingclothes as I call them
and came down just as you departed
Well I followed you to your door and
so made sure that I was really an ob
ject of interest to the celebrated Mr Sher
lock Holmes Then I rather imprudently
wished you goodnight and started for
the Temple to see my husband
We both thought the best resource was
ight when pursued by so formidable an
antagonist so you will nd the nest empty
when you call tomorrow As to the pho
tograph your client may rest in peace I
love and am loved by a better man than
he The King may do what he will without
hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
wronged I keep it only to safeguard my
self and to preserve a weapon which will
always secure me from any steps which
he might take in the future I leave a pho
tograph which he might care to possess
and I remain dear Mr Sherlock Holmes
 Very truly yours
Irene Norton nee Adler
What a womanoh what a woman cried the
King of Bohemia when we had all three read this
epistle Did I not tell you how quick and resolute
she was Would she not have made an admirable
queen Is it not a pity that she was not on my level
From what I have seen of the lady she seems
indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty
said Holmes coldly I am sorry that I have not been
able to bring your Majestys business to a more suc
cessful conclusion
On the contrary my dear sir cried the King
nothing could be more successful I know that her
word is inviolate The photograph is now as safe as if
it were in the re
I am glad to hear your Majesty say so
I am immensely indebted to you Pray tell me in
what way I can reward you This ring He slipped
an emerald snake ring from his nger and held it out
upon the palm of his hand
Your Majesty has something which I should value
even more highly said Holmes
You have but to name it
This photograph
The King stared at him in amazement
Irenes photograph he cried Certainly if you
wish it
I thank your Majesty Then there is no more to
be done in the matter I have the honour to wish
you a very goodmorning He bowed and turning
away without observing the hand which the King had
stretched out to him he set off in my company for his
chambers
And that was how a great scandal threatened to af
fect the kingdom of Bohemia and how the best plans
of Mr Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a womans
wit He used to make merry over the cleverness of
women but I have not heard him do it of late And
when he speaks of Irene Adler or when he refers to
her photograph it is always under the honourable
title of the woman
