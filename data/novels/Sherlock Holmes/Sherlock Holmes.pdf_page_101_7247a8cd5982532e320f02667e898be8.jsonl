The Adventure of the Speckled Band
the opening her face blanched with terror her hands
groping for help her whole gure swaying to and fro
like that of a drunkard I ran to her and threw my
arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed
to give way and she fell to the ground She writhed as
one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dread
fully convulsed At rst I thought that she had not
recognised me but as I bent over her she suddenly
shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget Oh
my God Helen It was the band The speckled band
There was something else which she would fain have
said and she stabbed with her nger into the air in
the direction of the doctors room but a fresh con
vulsion seized her and choked her words I rushed
out calling loudly for my stepfather and I met him
hastening from his room in his dressinggown When
he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and
though he poured brandy down her throat and sent
for medical aid from the village all efforts were in
vain for she slowly sank and died without having
recovered her consciousness Such was the dreadful
end of my beloved sister
One moment said Holmes are you sure about
this whistle and metallic sound Could you swear to
it
That was what the county coroner asked me at
the inquiry It is my strong impression that I heard it
and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking
of an old house I may possibly have been deceived
Was your sister dressed
No she was in her nightdress In her right hand
was found the charred stump of a match and in her
left a matchbox
Showing that she had struck a light and looked
about her when the alarm took place That is impor
tant And what conclusions did the coroner come
to
He investigated the case with great care for Dr
Roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the
county but he was unable to nd any satisfactory
cause of death My evidence showed that the door
had been fastened upon the inner side and the win
dows were blocked by oldfashioned shutters with
broad iron bars which were secured every night The
walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be
quite solid all round and the ooring was also thor
oughly examined with the same result The chimney
is wide but is barred up by four large staples It is
certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when
she met her end Besides there were no marks of any
violence upon her
How about poison
The doctors examined her for it but without suc
cess
What do you think that this unfortunate lady
died of then
It is my belief that she died of pure fear and ner
vous shock though what it was that frightened her I
cannot imagine
Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time
Yes there are nearly always some there
Ah and what did you gather from this allusion
to a banda speckled band
Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the
wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have re
ferred to some band of people perhaps to these very
gipsies in the plantation I do not know whether the
spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear
over their heads might have suggested the strange
adjective which she used
Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from
being satised
These are very deep waters said he pray go
on with your narrative
Two years have passed since then and my life
has been until lately lonelier than ever A month ago
however a dear friend whom I have known for many
years has done me the honour to ask my hand in mar
riage His name is ArmitagePercy Armitagethe
second son of Mr Armitage of Crane Water near
Reading My stepfather has offered no opposition to
the match and we are to be married in the course of
the spring Two days ago some repairs were started
in the west wing of the building and my bedroom
wall has been pierced so that I have had to move into
the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep
in the very bed in which she slept Imagine then
my thrill of terror when last night as I lay awake
thinking over her terrible fate I suddenly heard in the
silence of the night the low whistle which had been
the herald of her own death I sprang up and lit the
lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room I was
too shaken to go to bed again however so I dressed
and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down got
a dogcart at the Crown Inn which is opposite and
drove to Leatherhead from whence I have come on
this morning with the one object of seeing you and
asking your advice
You have done wisely said my friend But have
you told me all
Yes all
