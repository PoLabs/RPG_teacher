The Man with the Twisted Lip
And on what day did he meet his death
On Monday
Then perhaps Mr Holmes you will be good
enough to explain how it is that I have received a
letter from him today
Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he
had been galvanised
What he roared
Yes today She stood smiling holding up a little
slip of paper in the air
May I see it
Certainly
He snatched it from her in his eagerness and
smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the
lamp and examined it intently I had left my chair
and was gazing at it over his shoulder The envelope
was a very coarse one and was stamped with the
Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very
day or rather of the day before for it was considerably
after midnight
Coarse writing murmured Holmes Surely this
is not your husbands writing madam
No but the enclosure is
I perceive also that whoever addressed the enve
lope had to go and inquire as to the address
How can you tell that
The name you see is in perfectly black ink
which has dried itself The rest is of the greyish colour
which shows that blottingpaper has been used If it
had been written straight off and then blotted none
would be of a deep black shade This man has written
the name and there has then been a pause before he
wrote the address which can only mean that he was
not familiar with it It is of course a trie but there
is nothing so important as tries Let us now see the
letter Ha there has been an enclosure here
Yes there was a ring His signetring
And you are sure that this is your husbands
hand
One of his hands
One
His hand when he wrote hurriedly It is very
unlike his usual writing and yet I know it well
Dearest do not be frightened All will
come well There is a huge error which it
may take some little time to rectify Wait
in patience

Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb Ha And the
ap has been gummed if I am not very much in error
by a person who had been chewing tobacco And
you have no doubt that it is your husbands hand
madam
None Neville wrote those words
And they were posted today at Gravesend Well
Mrs St Clair the clouds lighten though I should not
venture to say that the danger is over
But he must be alive Mr Holmes
Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the
wrong scent The ring after all proves nothing It
may have been taken from him
No no it is it is his very own writing
Very well It may however have been written on
Monday and only posted today
That is possible
If so much may have happened between
Oh you must not discourage me Mr Holmes
I know that all is well with him There is so keen a
sympathy between us that I should know if evil came
upon him On the very day that I saw him last he cut
himself in the bedroom and yet I in the diningroom
rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty
that something had happened Do you think that I
would respond to such a trie and yet be ignorant of
his death
I have seen too much not to know that the im
pression of a woman may be more valuable than the
conclusion of an analytical reasoner And in this letter
you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to
corroborate your view But if your husband is alive
and able to write letters why should he remain away
from you
I cannot imagine It is unthinkable
And on Monday he made no remarks before leav
ing you
No
And you were surprised to see him in Swandam
Lane
Very much so
Was the window open
Yes
Then he might have called to you
He might
