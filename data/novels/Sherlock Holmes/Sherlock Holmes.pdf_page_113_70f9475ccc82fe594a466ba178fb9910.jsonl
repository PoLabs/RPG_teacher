The Adventure of the Engineers Thumb
have been It had been hacked or torn right out from
the roots
Good heavens I cried this is a terrible injury
It must have bled considerably
Yes it did I fainted when it was done and I
think that I must have been senseless for a long time
When I came to I found that it was still bleeding so I
tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round
the wrist and braced it up with a twig
Excellent You should have been a surgeon
It is a question of hydraulics you see and came
within my own province
This has been done said I examining the
wound by a very heavy and sharp instrument
A thing like a cleaver said he
An accident I presume
By no means
What a murderous attack
Very murderous indeed
You horrify me
I sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and
nally covered it over with cotton wadding and car
bolised bandages
He lay back without wincing
though he bit his lip from time to time
How is that I asked when I had nished
Capital Between your brandy and your bandage
I feel a new man I was very weak but I have had a
good deal to go through
Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter
It is evidently trying to your nerves
Oh no not now I shall have to tell my tale to the
police but between ourselves if it were not for the
convincing evidence of this wound of mine I should
be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a
very extraordinary one and I have not much in the
way of proof with which to back it up and even if
they believe me the clues which I can give them are
so vague that it is a question whether justice will be
done
Ha cried I if it is anything in the nature of
a problem which you desire to see solved I should
strongly recommend you to come to my friend Mr
Sherlock Holmes before you go to the ofcial police
Oh I have heard of that fellow answered my
visitor and I should be very glad if he would take
the matter up though of course I must use the ofcial
police as well Would you give me an introduction to
him
Ill do better Ill take you round to him myself
I should be immensely obliged to you
Well call a cab and go together We shall just be
in time to have a little breakfast with him Do you
feel equal to it
Yes I shall not feel easy until I have told my
story
Then my servant will call a cab and I shall be
with you in an instant I rushed upstairs explained
the matter shortly to my wife and in ve minutes was
inside a hansom driving with my new acquaintance
to Baker Street
Sherlock Holmes was as I expected lounging
about his sittingroom in his dressinggown read
ing the agony column of The Times and smoking his
beforebreakfast pipe which was composed of all the
plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day be
fore all carefully dried and collected on the corner of
the mantelpiece He received us in his quietly genial
fashion ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined
us in a hearty meal When it was concluded he set
tled our new acquaintance upon the sofa placed a
pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy
and water within his reach
It is easy to see that your experience has been no
common one Mr Hatherley said he Pray lie down
there and make yourself absolutely at home Tell us
what you can but stop when you are tired and keep
up your strength with a little stimulant
Thank you said my patient but I have felt an
other man since the doctor bandaged me and I think
that your breakfast has completed the cure I shall
take up as little of your valuable time as possible so I
shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences
Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary
heavylidded expression which veiled his keen and
eager nature while I sat opposite to him and we lis
tened in silence to the strange story which our visitor
detailed to us
You must know said he that I am an orphan
and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in London
By profession I am a hydraulic engineer and I have
had considerable experience of my work during the
seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner  Math
eson the wellknown rm of Greenwich Two years
ago having served my time and having also come
into a fair sum of money through my poor fathers
death I determined to start in business for myself
and took professional chambers in Victoria Street
I suppose that everyone nds his rst indepen

has been exceptionally so During two years I have
