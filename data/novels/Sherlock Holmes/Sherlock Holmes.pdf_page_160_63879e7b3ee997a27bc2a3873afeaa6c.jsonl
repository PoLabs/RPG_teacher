The Adventure of the Copper Beeches
You are in my power Ill serve you He turned and
clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go
Hes gone for the dog cried Miss Hunter
I have my revolver said I
Better close the front door cried Holmes and
we all rushed down the stairs together We had hardly
reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound
and then a scream of agony with a horrible worry
ing sound which it was dreadful to listen to An
elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came
staggering out at a side door
My God he cried Someone has loosed the
dog Its not been fed for two days Quick quick or
itll be too late
Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle
of the house with Toller hurrying behind us There
was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried
in Rucastles throat while he writhed and screamed
upon the ground Running up I blew its brains out
and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting
in the great creases of his neck With much labour
we separated them and carried him living but hor
ribly mangled into the house We laid him upon
the drawingroom sofa and having dispatched the
sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife I did what
I could to relieve his pain We were all assembled
round him when the door opened and a tall gaunt
woman entered the room
Mrs Toller cried Miss Hunter
Yes miss Mr Rucastle let me out when he came
back before he went up to you Ah miss it is a pity
you didnt let me know what you were planning for
I would have told you that your pains were wasted
Ha said Holmes looking keenly at her It is
clear that Mrs Toller knows more about this matter
than anyone else
Yes sir I do and I am ready enough to tell what
I know
Then pray sit down and let us hear it for there
are several points on which I must confess that I am
still in the dark
I will soon make it clear to you said she and
Id have done so before now if I could ha got out
from the cellar If theres policecourt business over
this youll remember that I was the one that stood
your friend and that I was Miss Alices friend too
She was never happy at home Miss Alice wasnt
from the time that her father married again
She
was slighted like and had no say in anything but it
never really became bad for her until after she met
Mr Fowler at a friends house As well as I could
learn Miss Alice had rights of her own by will but
she was so quiet and patient she was that she never
said a word about them but just left everything in
Mr Rucastles hands He knew he was safe with her
but when there was a chance of a husband coming
forward who would ask for all that the law would
give him then her father thought it time to put a stop
on it He wanted her to sign a paper so that whether
she married or not he could use her money When
she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until she
got brainfever and for six weeks was at deaths door
Then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and
with her beautiful hair cut off but that didnt make
no change in her young man and he stuck to her as
true as man could be
Ah said Holmes I think that what you have
been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly
clear and that I can deduce all that remains Mr
Rucastle then I presume took to this system of im
prisonment
Yes sir
And brought Miss Hunter down from London in
order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr
Fowler
That was it sir
But Mr Fowler being a persevering man as a
good seaman should be blockaded the house and
having met you succeeded by certain arguments
metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your
interests were the same as his
Mr Fowler was a very kindspoken freehanded
gentleman said Mrs Toller serenely
And in this way he managed that your good
man should have no want of drink and that a ladder
should be ready at the moment when your master
had gone out
You have it sir just as it happened
I am sure we owe you an apology Mrs Toller
said Holmes for you have certainly cleared up every
thing which puzzled us And here comes the country
surgeon and Mrs Rucastle so I think Watson that
we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester
as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a
questionable one
And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister
house with the copper beeches in front of the door Mr
Rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept
alive solely through the care of his devoted wife They
still live with their old servants who probably know
so much of Rucastles past life that he nds it difcult
