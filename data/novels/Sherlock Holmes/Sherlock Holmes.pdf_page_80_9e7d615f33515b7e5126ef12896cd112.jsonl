The Man with the Twisted Lip
the streets of the Surrey side Passing down the Wa
terloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river and
dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the
right and found ourselves in Bow Street Sherlock
Holmes was well known to the force and the two
constables at the door saluted him One of them held
the horses head while the other led us in
Who is on duty asked Holmes
Inspector Bradstreet sir
Ah Bradstreet how are you A tall stout of
cial had come down the stoneagged passage in a
peaked cap and frogged jacket I wish to have a quiet
word with you Bradstreet Certainly Mr Holmes
Step into my room here It was a small ofcelike
room with a huge ledger upon the table and a tele
phone projecting from the wall The inspector sat
down at his desk
What can I do for you Mr Holmes
I called about that beggarman Boonethe one
who was charged with being concerned in the disap
pearance of Mr Neville St Clair of Lee
Yes He was brought up and remanded for fur
ther inquiries
So I heard You have him here
In the cells
Is he quiet
Oh he gives no trouble
But he is a dirty
scoundrel
Dirty
Yes it is all we can do to make him wash his
hands and his face is as black as a tinkers Well
when once his case has been settled he will have a
regular prison bath and I think if you saw him you
would agree with me that he needed it
I should like to see him very much
Would you That is easily done Come this way
You can leave your bag
No I think that Ill take it
Very good Come this way if you please He
led us down a passage opened a barred door passed
down a winding stair and brought us to a white
washed corridor with a line of doors on each side
The third on the right is his said the inspector
Here it is He quietly shot back a panel in the upper
part of the door and glanced through
He is asleep said he You can see him very
well
We both put our eyes to the grating The pris
oner lay with his face towards us in a very deep
sleep breathing slowly and heavily He was a middle
sized man coarsely clad as became his calling with
a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his
tattered coat He was as the inspector had said ex
tremely dirty but the grime which covered his face
could not conceal its repulsive ugliness A broad
wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to
chin and by its contraction had turned up one side
of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a
perpetual snarl A shock of very bright red hair grew
low over his eyes and forehead
Hes a beauty isnt he said the inspector
He certainly needs a wash remarked Holmes
I had an idea that he might and I took the liberty of
bringing the tools with me He opened the Gladstone
bag as he spoke and took out to my astonishment a
very large bathsponge
He he You are a funny one chuckled the
inspector
Now if you will have the great goodness to open
that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a
much more respectable gure
Well I dont know why not said the inspector
He doesnt look a credit to the Bow Street cells does
he He slipped his key into the lock and we all
very quietly entered the cell The sleeper half turned
and then settled down once more into a deep slum
ber Holmes stooped to the waterjug moistened his
sponge and then rubbed it twice vigorously across
and down the prisoners face
Let me introduce you he shouted to Mr
Neville St Clair of Lee in the county of Kent
Never in my life have I seen such a sight The
mans face peeled off under the sponge like the bark
from a tree Gone was the coarse brown tint Gone
too was the horrid scar which had seamed it across
and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive
sneer to the face A twitch brought away the tan
gled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was
a pale sadfaced renedlooking man blackhaired
and smoothskinned rubbing his eyes and staring
about him with sleepy bewilderment Then suddenly
realising the exposure he broke into a scream and
threw himself down with his face to the pillow
Great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed
the missing man I know him from the photograph
The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man
who abandons himself to his destiny Be it so said
he And pray what am I charged with
