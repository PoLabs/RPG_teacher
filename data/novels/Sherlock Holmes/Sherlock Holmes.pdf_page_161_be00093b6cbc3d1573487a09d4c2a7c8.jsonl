The Adventure of the Copper Beeches
to part from them Mr Fowler and Miss Rucastle
were married by special license in Southampton the
day after their ight and he is now the holder of a
government appointment in the island of Mauritius

in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of
one of his problems and she is now the head of a
private school at Walsall where I believe that she has
met with considerable success
