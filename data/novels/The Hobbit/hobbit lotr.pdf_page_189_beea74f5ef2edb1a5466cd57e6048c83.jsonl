way and Oin and Gloin were sent back to their bundles at the top of the tunnel
After a while a twinkling gleam showed them returning Oin with a small
pinetorch alight in his hand and Gloin with a bundle of others under his arm
Quickly Bilbo trotted to the door and took the torch but he could not persuade
the dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet As Thorin carefully
explained Mr Baggins was still officially their expert burglar and investigator If
he liked to risk a light that was his affair They would wait in the tunnel for his
report So they sat near the door and watched
They saw the little dark shape of the hobbit start across the floor holding his
tiny light aloft Every now and again while he was still near enough they caught
a glint and a tinkle as he stumbled on some golden thing The light grew smaller
as he wandered away into the vast hall then it began to rise dancing into the air
Bilbo was climbing the great mound of treasure Soon he stood upon the top and

Suddenly Bilbos arm went towards it drawn by its enchantment His small
hand would not close about it for it was a large and heavy gem but he lifted it
shut his eyes and put it in his deepest pocket
Now I am a burglar indeed thought he But I suppose I must tell the
dwarves about itsome time They did say I could pick and choose my own
share and I think I would choose this if they took all the rest All the same he
had an uncomfortable feeling that the picking and choosing had not really been
meant to include this marvellous gem and that trouble would yet come of it
Now he went on again Down the other side of the great mound he climbed
and the spark of his torch vanished from the sight of the watching dwarves But
