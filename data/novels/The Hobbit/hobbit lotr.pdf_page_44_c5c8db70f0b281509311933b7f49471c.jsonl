he said We need food for one thing and rest in reasonable safetyalso it is
very necessary to tackle the Misty Mountains by the proper path or else you will
get lost in them and have to come back and start at the beginning again if you
ever get back at all
They asked him where he was making for and he answered You are come
to the very edge of the Wild as some of you may know Hidden somewhere
ahead of us is the fair valley of Rivendell where Elrond lives in the Last Homely
House I sent a message by my friends and we are expected
That sounded nice and comforting but they had not got there yet and it was
not so easy as it sounds to find the Last Homely House west of the Mountains
There seemed to be no trees and no valleys and no hills to break the ground in
front of them only one vast slope going slowly up and up to meet the feet of the
nearest mountain a wide land the colour of heather and crumbling rock with
patches and slashes of grassgreen and mossgreen showing where water might
be
Morning passed afternoon came but in all the silent waste there was no sign
of any dwelling They were growing anxious for they saw now that the house
might be hidden almost anywhere between them and the mountains They came
on unexpected valleys narrow with steep sides that opened suddenly at their
feet and they looked down surprised to see trees below them and running water
at the bottom There were gullies that they could almost leap over but very deep
with waterfalls in them There were dark ravines that one could neither jump
over nor climb into There were bogs some of them green pleasant places to
look at with flowers growing bright and tall but a pony that walked there with a
pack on its back would never have come out again
It was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever
you would have guessed Bilbo was astonished The only path was marked with
white stones some of which were small and others were half covered with moss
or heather Altogether it was a very slow business following the track even
guided by Gandalf who seemed to know his way about pretty well
His head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for the stones and
they followed his lead but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search when
the day began to fail Teatime had long gone by and it seemed suppertime
would soon do the same There were moths fluttering about and the light
became very dim for the moon had not risen Bilbos pony began to stumble
over roots and stones They came to the edge of a steep fall in the ground so
suddenly that Gandalfs horse nearly slipped down the slope
