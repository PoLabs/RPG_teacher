A just question replied Bard But you are not dead and we are not
robbers Moreover the wealthy may have pity beyond right on the needy that
befriended them when they were in want And still my other claims remain
unanswered
I will not parley as I have said with armed men at my gate Nor at all with
the people of the Elvenking whom I remember with small kindness In this
debate they have no place Begone now ere our arrows fly And if you would
speak with me again first dismiss the elvish host to the woods where it belongs
and then return laying down your arms before you approach the threshold

You may eat that if you will
With that the messengers departed swiftly and the dwarves were left to
consider their case So grim had Thorin become that even if they had wished
the others would not have dared to find fault with him but indeed most of them
seemed to share his mindexcept perhaps old fat Bombur and Fili and Kili
