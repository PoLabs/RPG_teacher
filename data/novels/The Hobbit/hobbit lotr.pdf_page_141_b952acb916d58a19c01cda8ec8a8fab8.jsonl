was not very often he did no good He did not wish to desert the dwarves and
indeed he did not know where in the world to go without them He could not
keep up with the hunting elves all the time they were out so he never discovered
the ways out of the wood and was left to wander miserably in the forest
terrified of losing himself until a chance came of returning He was hungry too
outside for he was no hunter but inside the caves he could pick up a living of
some sort by stealing food from store or table when no one was at hand
I am like a burglar that cant get away but must go on miserably burgling
the same house day after day he thought This is the dreariest and dullest part
of all this wretched tiresome uncomfortable adventure I wish I was back in my
hobbithole by my own warm fireside with the lamp shining He often wished
too that he could get a message for help sent to the wizard but that of course

which shows how lowspirited he had become when he heard Bilbos little
voice at his keyhole He could hardly believe his ears Soon however he made up

whispered talk with the hobbit on the other side
So it was that Bilbo was able to take secretly Thorins message to each of the
other imprisoned dwarves telling them that Thorin their chief was also in prison
close at hand and that no one was to reveal their errand to the king not yet nor
before Thorin gave the word For Thorin had taken heart again hearing how the
hobbit had rescued his companions from the spiders and was determined once
