True true said Thorin
Well your father gave me this to give to you and if I have chosen my own
time and way for handing it over you can hardly blame me considering the
trouble I had to find you Your father could not remember his own name when he
gave me the paper and he never told me yours so on the whole I think I ought to
be praised and thanked Here it is said he handing the map to Thorin
I dont understand said Thorin and Bilbo felt he would have liked to say
the same The explanation did not seem to explain
Your grandfather said the wizard slowly and grimly gave the map to his
son for safety before he went to the mines of Moria Your father went away to
try his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed and lots of
adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had but he never got near the Mountain
How he got there I dont know but I found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the
Necromancer
Whatever were you doing there asked Thorin with a shudder and all the
dwarves shivered
Never you mind I was finding things out as usual and a nasty dangerous
business it was Even I Gandalf only just escaped I tried to save your father
but it was too late He was witless and wandering and had forgotten almost
everything except the map and the key
We have long ago paid the goblins of Moria said Thorin we must give a
thought to the Necromancer
Dont be absurd He is an enemy far beyond the powers of all the dwarves
put together if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the
world The one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use
the key The dragon and the Mountain are more than big enough tasks for you
Hear hear said Bilbo and accidentally said it aloud
Hear what they all said turning suddenly towards him and he was so
flustered that he answered Hear what I have got to say
Whats that they asked
Well I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round After all
there is the Sidedoor and dragons must sleep sometimes I suppose If you sit
on the doorstep long enough I daresay you will think of something And well
dont you know I think we have talked long enough for one night if you see
what I mean What about bed and an early start and all that I will give you a
good breakfast before you go
Before we go I suppose you mean said Thorin Arent you the burglar
