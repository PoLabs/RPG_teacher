Chapter VIII
FLIES AND SPIDERS
They walked in single file The entrance to the path was like a sort of arch
leading into a gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that leant together too old
and strangled with ivy and hung with lichen to bear more than a few blackened
leaves The path itself was narrow and wound in and out among the trunks Soon
the light at the gate was like a little bright hole far behind and the quiet was so
deep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them
and listened
As their eyes became used to the dimness they could see a little way to either
side in a sort of darkened green glimmer Occasionally a slender beam of sun
that had the luck to slip in through some opening in the leaves far above and
still more luck in not being caught in the tangled boughs and matted twigs
beneath stabbed down thin and bright before them But this was seldom and it
soon ceased altogether
There were black squirrels in the wood As Bilbos sharp inquisitive eyes got
used to seeing things he could catch glimpses of them whisking off the path and
scuttling behind treetrunks There were queer noises too grunts scufflings and
hurryings in the undergrowth and among the leaves that lay piled endlessly thick
in places on the forestfloor but what made the noises he could not see The
nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs dark dense cobwebs with threads
extraordinarily thick often stretched from tree to tree or tangled in the lower
branches on either side of them There were none stretched across the path but
whether because some magic kept it clear or for what other reason they could
not guess
It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had
hated the tunnels of the goblins and it seemed to offer even less hope of any
