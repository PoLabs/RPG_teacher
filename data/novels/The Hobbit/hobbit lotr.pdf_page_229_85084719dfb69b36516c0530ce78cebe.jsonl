Victory had been assured before the fall of night but the pursuit was still on
foot when Bilbo returned to the camp and not many were in the valley save the
more grievously wounded
Where are the Eagles he asked Gandalf that evening as he lay wrapped in
many warm blankets
Some are in the hunt said the wizard but most have gone back to their
eyries They would not stay here and departed with the first light of morning
Dain has crowned their chief with gold and sworn friendship with them
forever
I am sorry I mean I should have liked to see them again said Bilbo
sleepily perhaps I shall see them on the way home I suppose I shall be going
home soon
As soon as you like said the wizard
Actually it was some days before Bilbo really set out They buried Thorin
deep beneath the Mountain and Bard laid the Arkenstone upon his breast
There let it lie till the Mountain falls he said May it bring good fortune
to all his folk that dwell here after
Upon his tomb the Elvenking then laid Orcrist the elvish sword that had been
taken from Thorin in captivity It is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the dark
if foes approached and the fortress of the dwarves could not be taken by
surprise There now Dain son of Nain took up his abode and he became King
under the Mountain and in time many other dwarves gathered to his throne in
the ancient halls Of the twelve companions of Thorin ten remained Fili and
Kili had fallen defending him with shield and body for he was their mothers
elder brother The others remained with Dain for Dain dealt his treasure well
There was of course no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such
shares as had been planned to Balin and Dwalin and Dori and Nori and Ori and
Oin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bomburor to Bilbo Yet a fourteenth
share of all the silver and gold wrought and unwrought was given up to Bard
for Dain said We will honour the agreement of the dead and he has now the
Arkenstone in his keeping
Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great greater than that of
many mortal kings From that treasure Bard sent much gold to the Master of
Laketown and he rewarded his followers and friends freely To the Elvenking
he gave the emeralds of Girion such jewels as he most loved which Dain had
restored to him
To Bilbo he said This treasure is as much yours as it is mine though old
