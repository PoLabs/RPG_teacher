Woodelves realm I speak to the Master of the town of the Men of the Lake not
to the raftmen of the king
Then the Master hesitated and looked from one to the other The Elvenking
was very powerful in those parts and the Master wished for no enmity with him
nor did he think much of old songs giving his mind to trade and tolls to cargoes
and gold to which habit he owed his position Others were of different mind
however and quickly the matter was settled without him The news had spread
from the doors of the hall like fire through all the town People were shouting
inside the hall and outside it The quays were thronged with hurrying feet Some
began to sing snatches of old songs concerning the return of the King under the
Mountain that it was Thrors grandson not Thror himself that had come back did
not bother them at all Others took up the song and it rolled loud and high over
the lake
The King beneath the mountains
    The King of carven stone
The lord of silver fountains
    Shall come into his own
His crown shall be upholden
    His harp shall be restrung
His halls shall echo golden
    To songs of yore resung
The woods shall wave on mountains
    And grass beneath the sun
His wealth shall flow in fountains
    And the rivers golden run
The streams shall run in gladness
    The lakes shall shine and burn
All sorrow fail and sadness
    At the Mountainkings return
