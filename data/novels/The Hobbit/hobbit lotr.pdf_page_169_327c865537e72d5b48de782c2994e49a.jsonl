hang down the cliff to the valley before anything happens here What is our
burglar doing for us Since he has got an invisible ring and ought to be a
specially excellent performer now I am beginning to think he might go through
the Front Gate and spy things out a bit
Bilbo heard thisthe dwarves were on the rocks just above the enclosure
where he was sittingand Good Gracious he thought so that is what they
are beginning to think is it It is always poor me that has to get them out of their
difficulties at least since the wizard left Whatever am I going to do I might
have known that something dreadful would happen to me in the end I dont
think I could bear to see the unhappy valley of Dale again and as for that
steaming gate  
That night he was very miserable and hardly slept Next day the dwarves all
went wandering off in various directions some were exercising the ponies down
below some were roving about the mountainside All day Bilbo sat gloomily in
the grassy bay gazing at the stone or out west through the narrow opening He
had a queer feeling that he was waiting for something Perhaps the wizard will
suddenly come back today he thought
If he lifted his head he could see a glimpse of the distant forest As the sun
turned west there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof as if the light caught
the last pale leaves Soon he saw the orange ball of the sun sinking towards the
level of his eyes He went to the opening and there pale and faint was a thin new
moon above the rim of Earth
At that very moment he heard a sharp crack behind him There on the grey
stone in the grass was an enormous thrush nearly coal black its pale yellow
breast freckled with dark spots Crack It had caught a snail and was knocking it
on the stone Crack Crack
Suddenly Bilbo understood Forgetting all danger he stood on the ledge and
hailed the dwarves shouting and waving Those that were nearest came
tumbling over the rocks and as fast as they could along the ledge to him
wondering what on earth was the matter the others shouted to be hauled up the
ropes except Bombur of course he was asleep
Quickly Bilbo explained They all fell silent the hobbit standing by the grey
stone and the dwarves with wagging beards watching impatiently The sun sank
lower and lower and their hopes fell It sank into a belt of reddened cloud and
disappeared The dwarves groaned but still Bilbo stood almost without moving
The little moon was dipping to the horizon Evening was coming on Then
suddenly when their hope was lowest a red ray of the sun escaped like a finger
