crushed it seemed safer to them than the dreadful pathways under the trees
Moreover Beorn was going that way too
Farewell O Elvenking said Gandalf Merry be the greenwood while the
world is yet young And merry be all your folk
Farewell O Gandalf said the king May you ever appear where you are
most needed and least expected The oftener you appear in my halls the better
shall I be pleased
I beg of you said Bilbo stammering and standing on one foot to accept
this gift and he brought out a necklace of silver and pearls that Dain had given
him at their parting
In what way have I earned such a gift O hobbit said the king
Well er I thought dont you know said Bilbo rather confused that er
some little return should be made for your er hospitality I mean even a burglar
has his feelings I have drunk much of your wine and eaten much of your bread
I will take your gift O Bilbo the Magnificent said the king gravely And I
name you elffriend and blessed May your shadow never grow less or stealing
would be too easy Farewell
Then the elves turned towards the Forest and Bilbo started on his long road
home
He had many hardships and adventures before he got back The Wild was still
the Wild and there were many other things in it in those days beside goblins but
he was well guided and well guardedthe wizard was with him and Beorn for
much of the wayand he was never in great danger again Anyway by
midwinter Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back along both edges of the
Forest to the doors of Beorns house and there for a while they both stayed
Yuletide was warm and merry there and men came from far and wide to feast at
Beorns bidding The goblins of the Misty Mountains were now few and
terrified and hidden in the deepest holes they could find and the Wargs had
vanished from the woods so that men went abroad without fear Beorn indeed
became a great chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between
the mountains and the wood and it is said that for many generations the men of
his line had the power of taking bears shape and some were grim men and bad
but most were in heart like Beorn if less in size and strength In their day the last
goblins were hunted from the Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the
edge of the Wild
