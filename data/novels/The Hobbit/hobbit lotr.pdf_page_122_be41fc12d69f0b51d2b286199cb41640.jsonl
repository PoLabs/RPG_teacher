climb up and feel
That night they ate their very last scraps and crumbs of food and next morning
when they woke the first thing they noticed was that they were still gnawingly
hungry and the next thing was that it was raining and that here and there the drip
of it was dropping heavily on the forest floor That only reminded them that they
were also parchingly thirsty without doing anything to relieve them you cannot
quench a terrible thirst by standing under giant oaks and waiting for a chance
drip to fall on your tongue The only scrap of comfort there was came
unexpectedly from Bombur
He woke up suddenly and sat up scratching his head He could not make out
where he was at all nor why he felt so hungry for he had forgotten everything
that had happened since they started their journey that May morning long ago
The last thing that he remembered was the party at the hobbits house and they
had great difficulty in making him believe their tale of all the many adventures
they had had since
When he heard that there was nothing to eat he sat down and wept for he
felt very weak and wobbly in the legs Why ever did I wake up he cried I
was having such beautiful dreams I dreamed I was walking in a forest rather
like this one only lit with torches on the trees and lamps swinging from the
branches and fires burning on the ground and there was a great feast going on
going on for ever A woodland king was there with a crown of leaves and there
was a merry singing and I could not count or describe the things there were to
eat and drink
You need not try said Thorin In fact if you cant talk about something
else you had better be silent We are quite annoyed enough with you as it is If
you hadnt waked up we should have left you to your idiotic dreams in the
forest you are no joke to carry even after weeks of short commons
There was nothing now to be done but to tighten the belts round their empty
stomachs and hoist their empty sacks and packs and trudge along the track
without any great hope of ever getting to the end before they lay down and died
of starvation This they did all that day going very slowly and wearily while
Bombur kept on wailing that his legs would not carry him and that he wanted to
lie down and sleep
No you dont they said Let your legs take their share we have carried
you far enough
