fancy for fish from the lake and sometimes neither goblin nor fish came back
Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of rock in the middle of the lake He
was watching Bilbo now from the distance with his pale eyes like telescopes
Bilbo could not see him but he was wondering a lot about Bilbo for he could
see that he was no goblin at all
Gollum got into his boat and shot off from the island while Bilbo was sitting
on the brink altogether flummoxed and at the end of his way and his wits
Suddenly up came Gollum and whispered and hissed
Bless us and splash us my precioussss I guess its a choice feast at least a
tasty morsel itd make us gollum And when he said gollum he made a horrible
swallowing noise in his throat That is how he got his name though he always
called himself my precious
The hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin when the hiss came in his ears and
he suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him
Who are you he said thrusting his dagger in front of him
What iss he my preciouss whispered Gollum who always spoke to
himself through never having anyone else to speak to This is what he had come
to find out for he was not really very hungry at the moment only curious
otherwise he would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards
I am Mr Bilbo Baggins I have lost the dwarves and I have lost the wizard
and I dont know where I am and I dont want to know if only I can get away
Whats he got in his handses said Gollum looking at the sword which he
did not quite like
A sword a blade which came out of Gondolin
Sssss said Gollum and became quite polite Praps ye sits here and chats
with it a bitsy my preciousss It likes riddles praps it does does it He was
anxious to appear friendly at any rate for the moment and until he found out
more about the sword and the hobbit whether he was quite alone really whether
he was good to eat and whether Gollum was really hungry Riddles were all he
could think of Asking them and sometimes guessing them had been the only
game he had ever played with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in the
long long ago before he lost all his friends and was driven away alone and
crept down down into the dark under the mountains
Very well said Bilbo who was anxious to agree until he found out more
about the creature whether he was quite alone whether he was fierce or hungry
and whether he was a friend of the goblins
You ask first he said because he had not had time to think of a riddle
