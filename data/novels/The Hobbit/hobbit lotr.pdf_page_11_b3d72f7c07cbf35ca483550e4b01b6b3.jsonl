and prosperous and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast
smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly
toes neatly brushedGandalf came by Gandalf If you had heard only a
quarter of what I have heard about him and I have only heard very little of all
there is to hear you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale Tales and
adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went in the most
extraordinary fashion He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages
and ages not since his friend the Old Took died in fact and the hobbits had
