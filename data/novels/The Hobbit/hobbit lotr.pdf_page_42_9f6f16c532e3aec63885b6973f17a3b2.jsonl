along
To look ahead said he
And what brought you back in the nick of time
Looking behind said he
Exactly said Thorin but could you be more plain
I went on to spy out our road It will soon become dangerous and difficult
Also I was anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions I had not
gone very far however when I met a couple of friends of mine from Rivendell
Wheres that asked Bilbo
Dont interrupt said Gandalf You will get there in a few days now if
were lucky and find out all about it As I was saying I met two of Elronds
people They were hurrying along for fear of the trolls It was they who told me
that three of them had come down from the mountains and settled in the woods
not far from the road they had frightened everyone away from the district and
they waylaid strangers
I immediately had a feeling that I was wanted back Looking behind I saw a
fire in the distance and made for it So now you know Please be more careful
next time or we shall never get anywhere
Thank you said Thorin
