So they sang or very like that only there was a great deal more of it and
there was much shouting as well as the music of harps and of fiddles mixed up
with it Indeed such excitement had not been known in the town in the memory
of the oldest grandfather The Woodelves themselves began to wonder greatly
and even to be afraid They did not know of course how Thorin had escaped and
they began to think their king might have made a serious mistake As for the
Master he saw there was nothing else for it but to obey the general clamour for
the moment at any rate and to pretend to believe that Thorin was what he said
So he gave up to him his own great chair and set Fili and Kili beside him in
places of honour Even Bilbo was given a seat at the high table and no
explanation of where he came inno songs had alluded to him even in the
obscurest waywas asked for in the general bustle
Soon afterwards the other dwarves were brought into the town amid scenes of
astonishing enthusiasm They were all doctored and fed and housed and
pampered in the most delightful and satisfactory fashion A large house was
given up to Thorin and his company boats and rowers were put at their service
and crowds sat outside and sang songs all day or cheered if any dwarf showed
so much as his nose
Some of the songs were old ones but some of them were quite new and
spoke confidently of the sudden death of the dragon and of cargoes of rich
presents coming down the river to Laketown These were inspired largely by the
Master and they did not particularly please the dwarves but in the meantime
they were well contented and they quickly grew fat and strong again Indeed
within a week they were quite recovered fitted out in fine cloth of their proper
colours with beards combed and trimmed and proud steps Thorin looked and
walked as if his kingdom was already regained and Smaug chopped up into little
pieces
Then as he had said the dwarves good feeling towards the little hobbit grew
stronger every day There were no more groans or grumbles They drank his
health and they patted him on the back and they made a great fuss of him
which was just as well for he was not feeling particularly cheerful He had not
forgotten the look of the Mountain nor the thought of the dragon and he had
besides a shocking cold For three days he sneezed and coughed and he could
not go out and even after that his speeches at banquets were limited to Thag
you very buch
