Well if you know of anywhere better take us there said Gandalf who was
feeling very grumpy and was far from happy about the giants himself
The end of their argument was that they sent Fili and Kili to look for a better
shelter They had very sharp eyes and being the youngest of the dwarves by
some fifty years they usually got these sort of jobs when everybody could see
that it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo There is nothing like looking if you
want to find something or so Thorin said to the young dwarves You certainly
usually find something if you look but it is not always quite the something you
were after So it proved on this occasion
Soon Fili and Kili came crawling back holding on to the rocks in the wind
We have found a dry cave they said not far round the next corner and
ponies and all could get inside
Have you thoroughly explored it said the wizard who knew that caves up
in the mountains were seldom unoccupied
Yes yes they said though everybody knew they could not have been long

his wandas he did that day in Bilbos diningroom that seemed so long ago if
you remember and by its light they explored the cave from end to end
It seemed quite a fair size but not too large and mysterious It had a dry floor
and some comfortable nooks At one end there was room for the ponies and
there they stood mighty glad of the change steaming and champing in their
nosebags Oin and Gloin wanted to light a fire at the door to dry their clothes
but Gandalf would not hear of it So they spread out their wet things on the floor
and got dry ones out of their bundles then they made their blankets comfortable
got out their pipes and blew smoke rings which Gandalf turned into different
