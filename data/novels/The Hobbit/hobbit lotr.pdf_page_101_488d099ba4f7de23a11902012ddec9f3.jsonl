their names could be as he had never seen half of them before
I was coming over the mountains with a friend or two   said the wizard
Or two I can only see one and a little one at that said Beorn
Well to tell you the truth I did not like to bother you with a lot of us until I
found out if you were busy I will give a call if I may
Go on call away
So Gandalf gave a long shrill whistle and presently Thorin and Dori came
round the house by the garden path and stood bowing low before them
One or three you meant I see said Beorn But these arent hobbits they
are dwarves
Thorin Oakenshield at your service Dori at your service said the two
dwarves bowing again
I dont need your service thank you said Beorn but I expect you need
mine I am not over fond of dwarves but if it is true you are Thorin son of
Thrain son of Thror I believe and that your companion is respectable and that
you are enemies of goblins and are not up to any mischief in my landswhat are
you up to by the way
They are on their way to visit the land of their fathers away east beyond
Mirkwood put in Gandalf and it is entirely an accident that we are in your
lands at all We were crossing by the High Pass that should have brought us to
the road that lies to the south of your country when we were attacked by the evil
goblinsas I was about to tell you
Go on telling then said Beorn who was never very polite
There was a terrible storm the stonegiants were out hurling rocks and at
the head of the pass we took refuge in a cave the hobbit and I and several of our
companions  
Do you call two several
Well no As a matter of fact there were more than two
Where are they Killed eaten gone home
Well no They dont seem all to have come when I whistled Shy I expect
You see we are very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you to entertain
Go on whistle again I am in for a party it seems and one or two more
wont make much difference growled Beorn
Gandalf whistled again but Nori and Ori were there almost before he had
stopped for if you remember Gandalf had told them to come in pairs every five
minutes
Hullo said Beorn You came pretty quickwhere were you hiding
