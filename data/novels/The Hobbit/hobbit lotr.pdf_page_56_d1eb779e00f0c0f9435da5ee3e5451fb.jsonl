sing or croak keeping time with the flap of their flat feet on the stone and
shaking their prisoners as well
Clap Snap the black crack
Grip grab Pinch nab
And down down to Goblintown
    You go my lad
Clash crash Crush smash
Hammer and tongs Knocker and gongs
Pound pound far underground
    Ho ho my lad
Swish smack Whip crack
Batter and beat Yammer and bleat
Work work Nor dare to shirk
While Goblins quaff and Goblins laugh
Round and round far underground
    Below my lad
It sounded truly terrifying The walls echoed to the clap snap and the crush
smash and to the ugly laughter of their ho ho my lad The general meaning of
the song was only too plain for now the goblins took out whips and whipped
them with a swish smack and set them running as fast as they could in front of
them and more than one of the dwarves were already yammering and bleating
like anything when they stumbled into a big cavern
It was lit by a great red fire in the middle and by torches along the walls and
it was full of goblins They all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands
when the dwarves with poor little Bilbo at the back and nearest to the whips
came running in while the goblindrivers whooped and cracked their whips
behind The ponies were already there huddled in a corner and there were all the
baggages and packages lying broken open and being rummaged by goblins and
smelt by goblins and fingered by goblins and quarrelled over by goblins
I am afraid that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies
