managed and now he was left alone again running round putting the finishing
touches to the packing and hoping against hope that his plan would come off
It had not been done a bit too soon Only a minute or two after Balins lid had
been fitted on there came the sound of voices and the flicker of lights A number
of elves came laughing and talking into the cellars and singing snatches of song
They had left a merry feast in one of the halls and were bent on returning as soon
as they could
Wheres old Galion the butler said one I havent seen him at the tables
tonight He ought to be here now to show us what is to be done
I shall be angry if the old slowcoach is late said another I have no wish to
waste time down here while the song is up
Ha ha came a cry Heres the old villain with his head on a jug Hes
been having a little feast all to himself and his friend the captain
Shake him Wake him shouted the others impatiently
Galion was not at all pleased at being shaken or wakened and still less at
being laughed at Youre all late he grumbled Here am I waiting and waiting
down here while you fellows drink and make merry and forget your tasks Small
wonder if I fall asleep from weariness
Small wonder said they when the explanation stands close at hand in a
jug Come give us a taste of your sleepingdraught before we fall to No need to
wake the turnkey yonder He has had his share by the looks of it
Then they drank once round and became mighty merry all of a sudden But
they did not quite lose their wits Save us Galion cried some you began
your feasting early and muddled your wits You have stacked some full casks
here instead of the empty ones if there is anything in weight
Get on with the work growled the butler There is nothing in the feeling
of weight in an idle tosspots arms These are the ones to go and no others Do
as I say
Very well very well they answered rolling the barrels to the opening On
your head be it if the kings full buttertubs and his best wine is pushed into the
river for the Lakemen to feast on for nothing
Rollrollrollroll
rollrollrolling down the hole
Heave ho Splash plump
Down they go down they bump
