Its trolls said Bilbo from behind a tree They had forgotten all about him
Theyre hiding in the bushes with sacks said he
O are they said Thorin and he jumped forward to the fire before they
could leap on him He caught up a big branch all on fire at one end and Bert got
that end in his eye before he could step aside That put him out of the battle for a
bit Bilbo did his best He caught hold of Toms legas well as he could it was
thick as a young treetrunkbut he was sent spinning up into the top of some
bushes when Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorins face
