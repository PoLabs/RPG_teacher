could now see a light shining a reddish comfortablelooking light as it might be
a fire or torches twinkling
When they had looked at it for some while they fell to arguing Some said
no and some said yes Some said they could but go and see and anything
was better than little supper less breakfast and wet clothes all the night
Others said These parts are none too well known and are too near the
mountains Travellers seldom come this way now The old maps are no use
things have changed for the worse and the road is unguarded They have seldom

move quietly in woods absolutely quietly They take a pride in it and Bilbo had
sniffed more than once at what he called all this dwarvish racket as they went
along though I dont suppose you or I would have noticed anything at all on a
windy night not if the whole cavalcade had passed two feet off As for Bilbo
walking primly towards the red light I dont suppose even a weasel would have
stirred a whisker at it So naturally he got right up to the firefor fire it was
