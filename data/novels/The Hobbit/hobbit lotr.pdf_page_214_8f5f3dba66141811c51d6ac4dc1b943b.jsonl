will help him more than us if it is that queer little creature that is said to be their
servant
Servant indeed snorted Bilbo and in the middle of his snort he sneezed
loudly and the elves immediately gathered towards the sound
Lets have a light he said I am here if you want me and he slipped off
his ring and popped from behind a rock
They seized him quickly in spite of their surprise Who are you Are you
the dwarves hobbit What are you doing How did you get so far past our
sentinels they asked one after another
I am Mr Bilbo Baggins he answered companion of Thorin if you want
to know I know your king well by sight though perhaps he doesnt know me to
look at But Bard will remember me and it is Bard I particularly want to see
Indeed said they and what may be your business
Whatever it is its my own my good elves But if you wish ever to get back
to your own woods from this cold cheerless place he answered shivering you
will take me along quick to a fire where I can dryand then you will let me
speak to your chiefs as quick as may be I have only an hour or two to spare
That is how it came about that some two hours after his escape from the Gate
Bilbo was sitting beside a warm fire in front of a large tent and there sat too
gazing curiously at him both the Elvenking and Bard A hobbit in elvish armour
partly wrapped in an old blanket was something new to them
Really you know Bilbo was saying in his best business manner things are
impossible Personally I am tired of the whole affair I wish I was back in the
West in my own home where folk are more reasonable But I have an interest in
this matterone fourteenth share to be precise according to a letter which
fortunately I believe I have kept He drew from a pocket in his old jacket
which he still wore over his mail crumpled and much folded Thorins letter
that had been put under the clock on his mantelpiece in May
A share in the profits mind you he went on I am aware of that
Personally I am only too ready to consider all your claims carefully and deduct
what is right from the total before putting in my own claim However you dont
know Thorin Oakenshield as well as I do now I assure you he is quite ready to
sit on a heap of gold and starve as long as you sit here
Well let him said Bard Such a fool deserves to starve
Quite so said Bilbo I see your point of view At the same time winter is
