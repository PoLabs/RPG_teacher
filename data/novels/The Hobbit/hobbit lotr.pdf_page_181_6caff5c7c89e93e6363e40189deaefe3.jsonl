this important point too or were they laughing in their sleeves at him all the
time That is the effect that dragontalk has on the inexperienced Bilbo of
course ought to have been on his guard but Smaug had rather an overwhelming
personality
I tell you he said in an effort to remain loyal to his friends and to keep his
end up that gold was only an afterthought with us We came over hill and under
hill by wave and wind for Revenge Surely O Smaug the unassessably wealthy
you must realize that your success has made you some bitter enemies
Then Smaug really did laugha devastating sound which shook Bilbo to the
floor while far up in the tunnel the dwarves huddled together and imagined that
the hobbit had come to a sudden and a nasty end
Revenge he snorted and the light of his eyes lit the hall from floor to
ceiling like scarlet lightning Revenge The King under the Mountain is dead
and where are his kin that dare seek revenge Girion Lord of Dale is dead and I
have eaten his people like a wolf among sheep and where are his sons sons that
dare approach me I kill where I wish and none dare resist I laid low the
warriors of old and their like is not in the world today Then I was but young and
tender Now I am old and strong strong strong Thief in the Shadows he
gloated My armour is like tenfold shields my teeth are swords my claws
spears the shock of my tail a thunderbolt my wings a hurricane and my breath

waistcoat of fine diamonds
Yes it is rare and wonderful indeed said Smaug absurdly pleased He did
not know that the hobbit had already caught a glimpse of his peculiar under
covering on his previous visit and was itching for a closer view for reasons of
his own The dragon rolled over Look he said What do you say to that
Dazzlingly marvellous Perfect Flawless Staggering exclaimed Bilbo
aloud but what he thought inside was Old fool Why there is a large patch in
the hollow of his left breast as bare as a snail out of its shell
