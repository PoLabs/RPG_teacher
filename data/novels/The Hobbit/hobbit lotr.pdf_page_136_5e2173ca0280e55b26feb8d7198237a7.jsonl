I dont know but I expect starving in the forest
What were you doing in the forest
Looking for food and drink because we were starving
But what brought you into the forest at all asked the king angrily
At that Thorin shut his mouth and would not say another word
Very well said the king Take him away and keep him safe until he feels
inclined to tell the truth even if he waits a hundred years
Then the elves put thongs on him and shut him in one of the inmost caves
with strong wooden doors and left him They gave him food and drink plenty of
both if not very fine for Woodelves were not goblins and were reasonably
wellbehaved even to their worst enemies when they captured them The giant
spiders were the only living things that they had no mercy upon
There in the kings dungeon poor Thorin lay and after he had got over his
thankfulness for bread and meat and water he began to wonder what had
become of his unfortunate friends It was not very long before he discovered but
that belongs to the next chapter and the beginning of another adventure in which
the hobbit again showed his usefulness
