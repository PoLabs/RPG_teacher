why he was so nice to them for he told them himself He had been over the river
and right back up into the mountainsfrom which you can guess that he could
travel quickly in bears shape at any rate From the burnt wolfglade he had soon
found out that part of their story was true but he had found more than that he

news the goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for the dwarves and they
were fiercely angry because of the death of the Great Goblin and also because

them with food to last them for weeks with care and packed so as to be as easy
as possible to carrynuts flour sealed jars of dried fruits and red earthenware
pots of honey and twicebaked cakes that would keep good a long time and on a
