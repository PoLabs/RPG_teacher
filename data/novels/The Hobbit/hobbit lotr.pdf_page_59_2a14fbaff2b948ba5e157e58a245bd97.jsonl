floor biting and kicking and fighting as if they had all gone mad
Suddenly a sword flashed in its own light Bilbo saw it go right through the
Great Goblin as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his rage He fell dead
and the goblin soldiers fled before the sword shrieking into the darkness
The sword went back into its sheath Follow me quick said a voice fierce
and quiet and before Bilbo understood what had happened he was trotting along
again as fast as he could trot at the end of the line down more dark passages
with the yells of the goblinhall growing fainter behind him A pale light was
leading them on
Quicker quicker said the voice The torches will soon be relit
Half a minute said Dori who was at the back next to Bilbo and a decent
fellow He made the hobbit scramble on his shoulders as best he could with his
tied hands and then off they all went at a run with a clinkclink of chains and
many a stumble since they had no hands to steady themselves with Not for a
long while did they stop and by that time they must have been right down in the
very mountains heart
Then Gandalf lit up his wand Of course it was Gandalf but just then they
were too busy to ask how he got there He took out his sword again and again it
flashed in the dark by itself It burned with a rage that made it gleam if goblins
were about now it was bright as blue flame for delight in the killing of the great
lord of the cave It made no trouble whatever of cutting through the goblin
chains and setting all the prisoners free as quickly as possible This swords
name was Glamdring the Foehammer if you remember The goblins just called
it Beater and hated it worse than Biter if possible Orcrist too had been saved
for Gandalf had brought it along as well snatching it from one of the terrified
guards Gandalf thought of most things and though he could not do everything
he could do a great deal for friends in a tight corner
Are we all here said he handing his sword back to Thorin with a bow
Let me see onethats Thorin two three four five six seven eight nine
ten eleven where are Fili and Kili Here they are twelve thirteenand heres
Mr Baggins fourteen Well well it might be worse and then again it might be
a good deal better No ponies and no food and no knowing quite where we are
and hordes of angry goblins just behind On we go
On they went Gandalf was quite right they began to hear goblin noises and
horrible cries far behind in the passages they had come through That sent them
on faster than ever and as poor Bilbo could not possibly go half as fastfor
dwarves can roll along at a tremendous pace I can tell you when they have to
