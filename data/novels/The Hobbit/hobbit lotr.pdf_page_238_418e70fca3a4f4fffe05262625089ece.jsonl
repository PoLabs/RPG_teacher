many were going in and outnot even wiping their feet on the mat as Bilbo
noticed with annoyance
If he was surprised they were more surprised still He had arrived back in the
middle of an auction There was a large notice in black and red hung on the gate
stating that on June the Twentysecond Messrs Grubb Grubb and Burrowes
would sell by auction the effects of the late Bilbo Baggins Esquire of BagEnd
Underhill Hobbiton Sale to commence at ten oclock sharp It was now nearly
lunchtime and most of the things had already been sold for various prices from
next to nothing to old songs as is not unusual at auctions Bilbos cousins the
