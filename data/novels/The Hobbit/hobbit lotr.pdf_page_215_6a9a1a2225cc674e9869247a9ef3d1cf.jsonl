coming on fast Before long you will be having snow and what not and supplies
will be difficulteven for elves I imagine Also there will be other difficulties
You have not heard of Dain and the dwarves of the Iron Hills
We have a long time ago but what has he got to do with us asked the
king
I thought as much I see I have some information you have not got Dain I
may tell you is now less than two days march off and has at least five hundred
grim dwarves with hima good many of them have had experience in the
dreadful dwarf and goblin wars of which you have no doubt heard When they
arrive there may be serious trouble
Why do you tell us this Are you betraying your friends or are you
threatening us asked Bard grimly
My dear Bard squeaked Bilbo Dont be so hasty I never met such
suspicious folk I am merely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned Now I
will make you an offer 
Let us hear it they said
You may see it said he It is this and he drew forth the Arkenstone and
threw away the wrapping
The Elvenking himself whose eyes were used to things of wonder and
beauty stood up in amazement Even Bard gazed marvelling at it in silence It
was as if a globe had been filled with moonlight and hung before them in a net
woven of the glint of frosty stars
This is the Arkenstone of Thrain said Bilbo the Heart of the Mountain
and it is also the heart of Thorin He values it above a river of gold I give it to
you It will aid you in your bargaining Then Bilbo not without a shudder not
without a glance of longing handed the marvellous stone to Bard and he held it
in his hand as though dazed
But how is it yours to give he asked at last with an effort
O well said the hobbit uncomfortably It isnt exactly but well I am
willing to let it stand against all my claim dont you know I may be a burglar
or so they say personally I never really felt like onebut I am an honest one I
hope more or less Anyway I am going back now and the dwarves can do what
they like to me I hope you will find it useful
The Elvenking looked at Bilbo with a new wonder Bilbo Baggins he said
You are more worthy to wear the armour of elfprinces than many that have
looked more comely in it But I wonder if Thorin Oakenshield will see it so I
have more knowledge of dwarves in general than you have perhaps I advise you
