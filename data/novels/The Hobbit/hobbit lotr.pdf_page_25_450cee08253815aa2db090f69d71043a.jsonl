on his business manner usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money
off him and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live
up to Gandalfs recommendation Also I should like to know about risks out
ofpocket expenses time required and remuneration and so forthby which he
meant What am I going to get out of it and am I going to come back alive
O very well said Thorin Long ago in my grandfather Thrors time our
family was driven out of the far North and came back with all their wealth and
their tools to this Mountain on the map It had been discovered by my far
ancestor Thrain the Old but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made
huger halls and greater workshopsand in addition I believe they found a good
deal of gold and a great many jewels too Anyway they grew immensely rich and
famous and my grandfather was King under the Mountain again and treated
with great reverence by the mortal men who lived to the South and were
gradually spreading up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed by
the Mountain They built the merry town of Dale there in those days Kings used
to send for our smiths and reward even the least skillful most richly Fathers
would beg us to take their sons as apprentices and pay us handsomely
especially in foodsupplies which we never bothered to grow or find for
ourselves Altogether those were good days for us and the poorest of us had
money to spend and to lend and leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun
of it not to speak of the most marvellous and magical toys the like of which is
not to be found in the world nowadays So my grandfathers halls became full
of armour and jewels and carvings and cups and the toy market of Dale was the
wonder of the North
Undoubtedly that was what brought the dragon Dragons steal gold and
jewels you know from men and elves and dwarves wherever they can find
them and they guard their plunder as long as they live which is practically for
ever unless they are killed and never enjoy a brass ring of it Indeed they
hardly know a good bit of work from a bad though they usually have a good
notion of the current market value and they cant make a thing for themselves
not even mend a little loose scale of their armour There were lots of dragons in
the North in those days and gold was probably getting scarce up there with the
dwarves flying south or getting killed and all the general waste and destruction
that dragons make going from bad to worse There was a most specially greedy
strong and wicked worm called Smaug One day he flew up into the air and
came south The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the
North and the pinetrees on the Mountain creaking and cracking in the wind
