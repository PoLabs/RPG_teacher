to be parted from it any longer or when he was very very hungry and tired of
fish Then he would creep along dark passages looking for stray goblins He
might even venture into places where the torches were lit and made his eyes
blink and smart for he would be safe Oh yes quite safe No one would see him
no one would notice him till he had his fingers on their throat Only a few hours
ago he had worn it and caught a small goblinimp How it squeaked He still
had a bone or two left to gnaw but he wanted something softer
Quite safe yes he whispered to himself It wont see us will it my
precious No It wont see us and its nassty little sword will be useless yes

That is what was in his wicked little mind as he slipped suddenly from
Bilbos side and flapped back to his boat and went off into the dark Bilbo
thought he had heard the last of him Still he waited a while for he had no idea

could hardly be something good Come along he shouted
No not yet precious Gollum answered We must search for it its lost
gollum
But you never guessed my last question and you promised said Bilbo
Never guessed said Gollum Then suddenly out of the gloom came a sharp
hiss What has it got in its pocketses Tell us that It must tell first
As far as Bilbo knew there was no particular reason why he should not tell
Gollums mind had jumped to a guess quicker than his naturally for Gollum had
brooded for ages on this one thing and he was always afraid of its being stolen
But Bilbo was annoyed at the delay After all he had won the game pretty fairly
at a horrible risk Answers were to be guessed not given he said
