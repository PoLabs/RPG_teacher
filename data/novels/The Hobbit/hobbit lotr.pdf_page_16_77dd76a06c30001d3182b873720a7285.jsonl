very haughty and said nothing about service but poor Mr Baggins said he was
sorry so many times that at last he grunted pray dont mention it and stopped
frowning
Now we are all here said Gandalf looking at the row of thirteen hoods
the best detachable party hoodsand his own hat hanging on the pegs Quite a
merry gathering I hope there is something left for the latecomers to eat and
drink Whats that Tea No thank you A little red wine I think for me
And for me said Thorin
And raspberry jam and appletart said Bifur
And mincepies and cheese said Bofur
And porkpie and salad said Bombur
And more cakesand aleand coffee if you dont mind called the other
dwarves through the door
Put on a few eggs theres a good fellow Gandalf called after him as the
hobbit stumped off to the pantries And just bring out the cold chicken and
pickles
Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself
thought Mr Baggins who was feeling positively flummoxed and was beginning
to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house
By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses
and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays he was getting very hot
and red in the face and annoyed
Confusticate and bebother these dwarves he said aloud Why dont they
come and lend a hand Lo and behold there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door
of the kitchen and Fili and Kili behind them and before he could say knife they
had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out
everything afresh
Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round and
Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside nibbling at a biscuit his appetite was quite
taken away and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not in the
least an adventure The dwarves ate and ate and talked and talked and time got
on At last they pushed their chairs back and Bilbo made a move to collect the
plates and glasses
I suppose you will all stay to supper he said in his politest unpressing
tones
Of course said Thorin And after We shant get through the business till
late and we must have some music first Now to clear up
