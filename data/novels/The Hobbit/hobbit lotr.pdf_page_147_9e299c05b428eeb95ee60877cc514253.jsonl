So they sang as first one barrel and then another rumbled to the dark opening
and was pushed over into the cold water some feet below Some were barrels
really empty some were tubs neatly packed with a dwarf each but down they all
went one after another with many a clash and a bump thudding on top of ones
below smacking into the water jostling against the walls of the tunnel knocking
into one another and bobbing away down the current
It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in
his plan Most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him
but I dont suppose you would have done half as well yourselves in his place Of
course he was not in a barrel himself nor was there anyone to pack him in even
if there had been a chance It looked as if he would certainly lose his friends this
time nearly all of them had already disappeared through the dark trapdoor and
get utterly left behind and have to stay lurking as a permanent burglar in the elf
caves for ever For even if he could have escaped through the upper gates at
once he had precious small chance of ever finding the dwarves again He did not
know the way by land to the place where the barrels were collected He
wondered what on earth would happen to them without him for he had not had
time to tell the dwarves all that he had learned or what he had meant to do once
they were out of the wood
While all these thoughts were passing through his mind the elves being very
merry began to sing a song round the riverdoor Some had already gone to haul
on the ropes which pulled up the portcullis at the watergate so as to let out the
barrels as soon as they were all afloat below
Down the swift dark stream you go
Back to lands you once did know
Leave the halls and caverns deep
Leave the northern mountains steep
Where the forest wide and dim
Stoops in shadow grey and grim
Float beyond the world of trees
Out into the whispering breeze
Past the rushes past the reeds
Past the marshs waving weeds
Through the mist that riseth white
Up from mere and pool at night
