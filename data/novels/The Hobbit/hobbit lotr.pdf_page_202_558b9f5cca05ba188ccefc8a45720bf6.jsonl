the goblins were at council in their caves
That will be the last we shall hear of Thorin Oakenshield I fear said the
king He would have done better to have remained my guest It is an ill wind
all the same he added that blows no one any good For he too had not
forgotten the legend of the wealth of Thror So it was that Bards messengers
found him now marching with many spearmen and bowmen and crows were
gathered thick above him for they thought that war was awakening again such
as had not been in those parts for a long age
But the king when he received the prayers of Bard had pity for he was the
lord of a good and kindly people so turning his march which had at first been
direct towards the Mountain he hastened now down the river to the Long Lake
He had not boats or rafts enough for his host and they were forced to go the
slower way by foot but great store of goods he sent ahead by water Still elves
are lightfooted and though they were not in these days much used to the
marches and the treacherous lands between the Forest and the Lake their going
was swift Only five days after the death of the dragon they came upon the
shores and looked on the ruins of the town Their welcome was good as may be
expected and the men and their Master were ready to make any bargain for the
future in return for the Elvenkings aid
Their plans were soon made With the women and the children the old and
the unfit the Master remained behind and with him were some men of crafts
and many skilled elves and they busied themselves felling trees and collecting
the timber sent down from the Forest Then they set about raising many huts by
the shore against the oncoming winter and also under the Masters direction
they began the planning of a new town designed more fair and large even than
before but not in the same place They removed northward higher up the shore
for ever after they had a dread of the water where the dragon lay He would
never again return to his golden bed but was stretched cold as stone twisted
upon the floor of the shallows There for ages his huge bones could be seen in
calm weather amid the ruined piles of the old town But few dared to cross the
cursed spot and none dared to dive into the shivering water or recover the
precious stones that fell from his rotting carcase
But all the men of arms who were still able and the most of the Elvenkings
array got ready to march north to the Mountain It was thus that in eleven days
from the ruin of the town the head of their host passed the rockgates at the end
of the lake and came into the desolate lands
