the Mountain lying without guard or owner and he fell suddenly silent He
thought of the Masters words and of Dale rebuilt and filled with golden bells
if he could but find the men
At length he spoke again This is no time for angry words Master or for
considering weighty plans of change There is work to do I serve you still
