course that the riddlegame was sacred and of immense antiquity and even
wicked creatures were afraid to cheat when they played at it But he felt he could
not trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a pinch Any excuse would do
for him to slide out of it And after all that last question had not been a genuine
riddle according to the ancient laws
But at any rate Gollum did not at once attack him He could see the sword in
Bilbos hand He sat still shivering and whispering At last Bilbo could wait no
longer
Well he said What about your promise I want to go You must show me
the way
Did we say so precious Show the nassty little Baggins the way out yes
yes But what has it got in its pocketses eh Not string precious but not
nothing Oh no gollum
Never you mind said Bilbo A promise is a promise
Cross it is impatient precious hissed Gollum But it must wait yes it
must We cant go up the tunnels so hasty We must go and get some things first
yes things to help us
Well hurry up said Bilbo relieved to think of Gollum going away He
thought he was just making an excuse and did not mean to come back What was
Gollum talking about What useful thing could he keep out on the dark lake
But he was wrong Gollum did mean to come back He was angry now and
hungry And he was a miserable wicked creature and already he had a plan
Not far away was his island of which Bilbo knew nothing and there in his
hidingplace he kept a few wretched oddments and one very beautiful thing
very beautiful very wonderful He had a ring a golden ring a precious ring
My birthdaypresent he whispered to himself as he had often done in the
endless dark days Thats what we wants now yes we wants it
He wanted it because it was a ring of power and if you slipped that ring on
your finger you were invisible only in the full sunlight could you be seen and
then only by your shadow and that would be shaky and faint
My birthdaypresent It came to me on my birthday my precious So he
had always said to himself But who knows how Gollum came by that present
ages ago in the old days when such rings were still at large in the world Perhaps
even the Master who ruled them could not have said Gollum used to wear it at
first till it tired him and then he kept it in a pouch next his skin till it galled
him and now usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island and was always
going back to look at it And still sometimes he put it on when he could not bear
