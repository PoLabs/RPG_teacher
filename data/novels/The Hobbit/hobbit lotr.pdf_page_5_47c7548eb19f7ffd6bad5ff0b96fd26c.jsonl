NOTE ON THE TEXT
The Hobbit was first published in September 1937 Its 1951 second edition fifth
impression contains a significantly revised portion of Chapter V Riddles in the
Dark which brings the story of The Hobbit more in line with its sequel The
Lord of the Rings then in progress Tolkien made some further revisions to the
American edition published by Ballantine Books in February 1966 and to the
British third edition sixteenth impression published by George Allen  Unwin
later that same year
For the 1995 British hardcover edition published by HarperCollins the text
of The Hobbit was entered into wordprocessing files and a number of further
corrections of misprints and errors were made Since then various editions of
The Hobbit have been generated from that computerized text file For the present
text that file has been compared again line by line with the earlier editions and
a number of further corrections have been made to present a text that as closely
as possible represents Tolkiens final intended form
Readers interested in details of the changes made at various times to the text
of The Hobbit are referred to Appendix A Textual and Revisional Notes of
The Annotated Hobbit 1988 and J R R Tolkien A Descriptive Bibliography
