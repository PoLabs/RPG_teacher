But Bilbo simply could not think of any question with that nasty wet cold
thing sitting next to him and pawing and poking him He scratched himself he
pinched himself still he could not think of anything
Ask us ask us said Gollum
Bilbo pinched himself and slapped himself he gripped on his little sword he

picked up in the passage and forgotten about
What have I got in my pocket he said aloud He was talking to himself

Not fair not fair he hissed It isnt fair my precious is it to ask us what

Bilbo seeing what had happened and having nothing better to ask stuck to his

Very well Guess away said Bilbo

but he did not feel at all sure how the game was going to end whether Gollum
