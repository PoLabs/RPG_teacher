Never heard of him growled the man And whats this little fellow he
said stooping down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy black eyebrows
That is Mr Baggins a hobbit of good family and unimpeachable
reputation said Gandalf Bilbo bowed He had no hat to take off and was
painfully conscious of his many missing buttons I am a wizard continued
Gandalf I have heard of you if you have not heard of me but perhaps you
have heard of my good cousin Radagast who lives near the Southern borders of
Mirkwood
Yes not a bad fellow as wizards go I believe I used to see him now and
again said Beorn Well now I know who you are or who you say you are
What do you want
To tell you the truth we have lost our luggage and nearly lost our way and
are rather in need of help or at least of advice I may say we have had rather a
bad time with goblins in the mountains
Goblins said the big man less gruffly O ho so youve been having
trouble with them have you What did you go near them for
We did not mean to They surprised us at night in a pass which we had to
cross we were coming out of the Lands over West into these countriesit is a
long tale
Then you had better come inside and tell me some of it if it wont take all
day said the man leading the way through a dark door that opened out of the
courtyard into the house
Following him they found themselves in a wide hall with a fireplace in the
middle Though it was summer there was a woodfire burning and the smoke
was rising to the blackened rafters in search of the way out through an opening
in the roof They passed through this dim hall lit only by the fire and the hole
above it and came through another smaller door into a sort of veranda propped
on wooden posts made of single treetrunks It faced south and was still warm
and filled with the light of the westering sun which slanted into it and fell
golden on the garden full of flowers that came right up to the steps
