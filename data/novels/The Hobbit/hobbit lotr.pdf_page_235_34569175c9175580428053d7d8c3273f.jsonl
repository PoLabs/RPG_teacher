Mirkwood
Ere long now Gandalf was saying the Forest will grow somewhat more
wholesome The North will be freed from that horror for many long years I
hope Yet I wish he were banished from the world
It would be well indeed said Elrond but I fear that will not come about in
this age of the world or for many after
When the tale of their journeyings was told there were other tales and yet
more tales tales of long ago and tales of new things and tales of no time at all
till Bilbos head fell forward on his chest and he snored comfortably in a corner
He woke to find himself in a white bed and the moon shining through an
open window Below it many elves were singing loud and clear on the banks of
the stream
Sing all ye joyful now sing all together
The winds in the treetop the winds in the heather
The stars are in blossom the moon is in flower
And bright are the windows of Night in her tower
Dance all ye joyful now dance all together
Soft is the grass and let foot be like feather
The river is silver the shadows are fleeting
Merry is Maytime and merry our meeting
Sing we now softly and dreams let us weave him
Wind him in slumber and there let us leave him
The wanderer sleepeth Now soft be his pillow
Lullaby Lullaby Alder and Willow
Sigh no more Pine till the wind of the morn
    Fall Moon Dark be the land
    Hush Hush Oak Ash and Thorn
Hushed be all water till dawn is at hand
Well Merry People said Bilbo looking out What time by the moon is
