but we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the southward plains
Very well said Gandalf Take us where and as far as you will We are
already deeply obliged to you But in the meantime we are famished with
hunger
I am nearly dead of it said Bilbo in a weak little voice that nobody heard
That can perhaps be mended said the Lord of the Eagles
Later on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock and the figures
of the dwarves round it cooking and making a fine roasting smell The eagles
had brought up dry boughs for fuel and they had brought rabbits hares and a
small sheep The dwarves managed all the preparations Bilbo was too weak to
help and anyway he was not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat
being used to having it delivered by the butcher all ready to cook Gandalf too
was lying down after doing his part in setting the fire going since Oin and Gloin
had lost their tinderboxes Dwarves have never taken to matches even yet
So ended the adventures of the Misty Mountains Soon Bilbos stomach was
feeling full and comfortable again and he felt he could sleep contentedly though
really he would have liked a loaf and butter better than bits of meat toasted on
sticks He slept curled up on the hard rock more soundly than ever he had done
on his featherbed in his own little hole at home But all night he dreamed of his
own house and wandered in his sleep into all his different rooms looking for
something that he could not find nor remember what it looked like
