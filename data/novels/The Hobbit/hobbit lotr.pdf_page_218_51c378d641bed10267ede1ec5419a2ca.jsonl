stone was my fathers and is mine he said Why should I purchase my own
But wonder overcame him and he added But how came you by the heirloom of
my houseif there is need to ask such a question of thieves
We are not thieves Bard answered Your own we will give back in return
for our own
How came you by it shouted Thorin in gathering rage
I gave it to them squeaked Bilbo who was peering over the wall by now
in a dreadful fright
You You cried Thorin turning upon him and grasping him with both
hands You miserable hobbit You undersizedburglar he shouted at a loss
for words and he shook poor Bilbo like a rabbit
By the beard of Durin I wish I had Gandalf here Curse him for his choice
of you May his beard wither As for you I will throw you to the rocks he cried
and lifted Bilbo in his arms
Stay Your wish is granted said a voice The old man with the casket threw
aside his hood and cloak Here is Gandalf And none too soon it seems If you
dont like my Burglar please dont damage him Put him down and listen first to
what he has to say
You all seem in league said Thorin dropping Bilbo on the top of the wall
Never again will I have dealings with any wizard or his friends What have you
to say you descendant of rats
Dear me Dear me said Bilbo I am sure this is all very uncomfortable
You may remember saying that I might choose my own fourteenth share
Perhaps I took it too literallyI have been told that dwarves are sometimes
politer in word than in deed The time was all the same when you seemed to
think that I had been of some service Descendant of rats indeed Is this all the
service of you and your family that I was promised Thorin Take it that I have
disposed of my share as I wished and let it go at that
I will said Thorin grimly And I will let you go at thatand may we
never meet again Then he turned and spoke over the wall I am betrayed he
said It was rightly guessed that I could not forbear to redeem the Arkenstone
the treasure of my house For it I will give one fourteenth share of the hoard in
silver and gold setting aside the gems but that shall be accounted the promised
share of this traitor and with that reward he shall depart and you can divide it as
you will He will get little enough I doubt not Take him if you wish him to live
and no friendship of mine goes with him
Get down now to your friends he said to Bilbo or I will throw you
