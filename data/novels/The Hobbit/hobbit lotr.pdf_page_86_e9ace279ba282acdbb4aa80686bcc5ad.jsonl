way back into it from the South cutting down trees and building themselves
places to live in among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the
rivershores There were many of them and they were brave and wellarmed
and even the Wargs dared not attack them if there were many together or in the
bright day But now they had planned with the goblins help to come by night
upon some of the villages nearest the mountains If their plan had been carried
out there would have been none left there next day all would have been killed

This was dreadful talk to listen to not only because of the brave woodmen

one hit the chief wolf on the nose and he leaped in the air ten feet and then
rushed round and round the circle biting and snapping even at the other wolves
in his anger and fright
The dwarves and Bilbo shouted and cheered The rage of the wolves was
