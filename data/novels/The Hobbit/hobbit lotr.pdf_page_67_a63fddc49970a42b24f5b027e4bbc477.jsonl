he asked to gain time until he could think of a really hard one This he thought a
dreadfully easy chestnut though he had not asked it in the usual words But it
proved a nasty poser for Gollum He hissed to himself and still he did not
answer he whispered and spluttered
After some while Bilbo became impatient Well what is it he said The
answers not a kettle boiling over as you seem to think from the noise you are
making
Give us a chance let it give us a chance my precioussssss
Well said Bilbo after giving him a long chance what about your guess
But suddenly Gollum remembered thieving from nests long ago and sitting
under the river bank teaching his grandmother teaching his grandmother to suck
Eggses he hissed Eggses it is Then he asked
Alive without breath
As cold as death
Never thirsty ever drinking
All in mail never clinking
He also in his turn thought this was a dreadfully easy one because he was
always thinking of the answer But he could not remember anything better at the
moment he was so flustered by the eggquestion All the same it was a poser for
poor Bilbo who never had anything to do with the water if he could help it I
imagine you know the answer of course or can guess it as easy as winking
since you are sitting comfortably at home and have not the danger of being eaten
to disturb your thinking Bilbo sat and cleared his throat once or twice but no
answer came
After a while Gollum began to hiss with pleasure to himself Is it nice my
preciousss Is it juicy Is it scrumptiously crunchable He began to peer at
Bilbo out of the darkness
Half a moment said the hobbit shivering I gave you a good long chance
just now
It must make haste haste said Gollum beginning to climb out of his boat
on to the shore to get at Bilbo But when he put his long webby foot in the water
a fish jumped out in a fright and fell on Bilbos toes
Ugh he said it is cold and clammyand so he guessed Fish fish
he cried It is fish
