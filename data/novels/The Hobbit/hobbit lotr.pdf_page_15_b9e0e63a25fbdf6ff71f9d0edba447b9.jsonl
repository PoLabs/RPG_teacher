to for they sounded much too adventurouswhen dingdongalingdang his
bell rang again as if some naughty little hobbitboy was trying to pull the handle
off
Someone at the door he said blinking
Some four I should say by the sound said Fili Besides we saw them
coming along behind us in the distance
The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands and
