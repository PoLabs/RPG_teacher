in all the mountains there was a forging and an arming Then they marched and
gathered by hill and valley going ever by tunnel or under dark until around and
beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North where was their capital a
vast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of storm unawares upon
the South Then they learned of the death of Smaug and joy was in their hearts
and they hastened night after night through the mountains and came thus at last
on a sudden from the North hard on the heels of Dain Not even the ravens knew
of their coming until they came out in the broken lands which divided the Lonely
Mountain from the hills behind How much Gandalf knew cannot be said but it
is plain that he had not expected this sudden assault
This is the plan that he made in council with the Elvenking and with Bard
and with Dain for the dwarflord now joined them the Goblins were the foes of
all and at their coming all other quarrels were forgotten Their only hope was to
lure the goblins into the valley between the arms of the Mountain and
themselves to man the great spurs that struck south and east Yet this would be
perilous if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain itself
and so attack them also from behind and above but there was no time to make
any other plan or to summon any help
Soon the thunder passed rolling away to the SouthEast but the batcloud
came flying lower over the shoulder of the Mountain and whirled above them
shutting out the light and filling them with dread
To the Mountain called Bard To the Mountain Let us take our places
while there is yet time
On the Southern spur in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet the Elves
were set on the Eastern spur were men and dwarves But Bard and some of the
nimblest of men and elves climbed to the height of the Eastern shoulder to gain a
view to the North Soon they could see the lands before the Mountains feet
black with a hurrying multitude Ere long the vanguard swirled round the spurs
end and came rushing into Dale These were the swiftest wolfriders and already
their cries and howls rent the air afar A few brave men were strung before them
to make a feint of resistance and many there fell before the rest drew back and
fled to either side As Gandalf had hoped the goblin army had gathered behind
the resisted vanguard and poured now in rage into the valley driving wildly up
between the arms of the Mountain seeking for the foe Their banners were
countless black and red and they came on like a tide in fury and disorder
It was a terrible battle The most dreadful of all Bilbos experiences and the
one which at the time he hated mostwhich is to say it was the one he was most
