guardroom There were several places like it round the Mountain But there
seemed small need for watching in the days of our prosperity and the guards
were made over comfortable perhapsotherwise we might have had longer
warning of the coming of the dragon and things might have been different Still
here we can now lie hid and sheltered for a while and can see much without
being seen
Not much use if we have been seen coming here said Dori who was
always looking up towards the Mountains peak as if he expected to see Smaug
perched there like a bird on a steeple
We must take our chance of that said Thorin We can go no further to
day
Hear hear cried Bilbo and flung himself on the ground
In the rockchamber there would have been room for a hundred and there
was a small chamber further in more removed from the cold outside It was
quite deserted not even wild animals seemed to have used it in all the days of
Smaugs dominion There they laid their burdens and some threw themselves
down at once and slept but the others sat near the outer door and discussed their
plans In all their talk they came perpetually back to one thing where was
Smaug They looked West and there was nothing and East there was nothing
and in the South there was no sign of the dragon but there was a gathering of
very many birds At that they gazed and wondered but they were no nearer
understanding it when the first cold stars came out
