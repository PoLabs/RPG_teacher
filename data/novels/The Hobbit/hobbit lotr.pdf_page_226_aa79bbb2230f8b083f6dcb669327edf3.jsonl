Chapter XVIII
THE RETURN JOURNEY
When Bilbo came to himself he was literally by himself He was lying on the
flat stones of Ravenhill and no one was near A cloudless day but cold was
broad above him He was shaking and as chilled as stone but his head burned
with fire
Now I wonder what has happened he said to himself At any rate I am
not yet one of the fallen heroes but I suppose there is still time enough for that
He sat up painfully Looking into the valley he could see no living goblins
After a while as his head cleared a little he thought he could see elves moving in
the rocks below He rubbed his eyes Surely there was a camp still in the plain
some distance off and there was a coming and going about the Gate Dwarves
seemed to be busy removing the wall But all was deadly still There was no call
and no echo of a song Sorrow seemed to be in the air
Victory after all I suppose he said feeling his aching head Well it
seems a very gloomy business
Suddenly he was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards him
Hullo there he called with a shaky voice Hullo there What news
What voice is it that speaks among the stones said the man halting and
peering about him not far from where Bilbo sat
Then Bilbo remembered his ring Well Im blessed said he This
invisibility has its drawbacks after all Otherwise I suppose I might have spent a
warm and comfortable night in bed
Its me Bilbo Baggins companion of Thorin he cried hurriedly taking off
the ring
It is well that I have found you said the man striding forward You are
needed and we have looked for you long You would have been numbered
