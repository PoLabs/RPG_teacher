There was a purse in it as big as a bag to Bilbo Ha thought he warming to
his new work as he lifted it carefully out this is a beginning
It was Trolls purses are the mischief and this was no exception Ere oo
are you it squeaked as it left the pocket and William turned round at once and
grabbed Bilbo by the neck before he could duck behind the tree
Blimey Bert look what Ive copped said William
What is it said the others coming up
Lumme if I knows What are yer
Bilbo Baggins a bura hobbit said poor Bilbo shaking all over and
wondering how to make owlnoises before they throttled him
A burrahobbit said they a bit startled Trolls are slow in the uptake and
mighty suspicious about anything new to them
Whats a burrahobbit got to do with my pocket anyways said William
And can yer cook em said Tom
Yer can try said Bert picking up a skewer
He wouldnt make above a mouthful said William who had already had a
fine supper not when he was skinned and boned
Praps there are more like him round about and we might make a pie said
Bert Here you are there any more of your sort asneakin in these here woods
yer nassty little rabbit said he looking at the hobbits furry feet and he picked
him up by the toes and shook him
Yes lots said Bilbo before he remembered not to give his friends away
No none at all not one he said immediately afterwards
What dyer mean said Bert holding him right way up by the hair this
time
What I say said Bilbo gasping And please dont cook me kind sirs I am
a good cook myself and cook better than I cook if you see what I mean Ill
cook beautifully for you a perfectly beautiful breakfast for you if only you
wont have me for supper
Poor little blighter said William He had already had as much supper as he
could hold also he had had lots of beer Poor little blighter Let him go
Not till he says what he means by lots and none at all said Bert I dont
want to have me throat cut in me sleep Hold his toes in the fire till he talks
I wont have it said William I caught him anyway
Youre a fat fool William said Bert as Ive said afore this evening
And youre a lout
And I wont take that from you Bill Huggins says Bert and puts his fist in
