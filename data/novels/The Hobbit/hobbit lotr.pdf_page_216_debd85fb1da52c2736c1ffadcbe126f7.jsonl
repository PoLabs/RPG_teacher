to remain with us and here you shall be honoured and thrice welcome
Thank you very much I am sure said Bilbo with a bow But I dont think I
ought to leave my friends like this after all we have gone through together And
I promised to wake old Bombur at midnight too Really I must be going and
quickly
Nothing they could say would stop him so an escort was provided for him
and as he went both the king and Bard saluted him with honour As they passed
through the camp an old man wrapped in a dark cloak rose from a tent door
where he was sitting and came towards them
Well done Mr Baggins he said clapping Bilbo on the back There is
always more about you than anyone expects It was Gandalf
For the first time for many a day Bilbo was really delighted But there was no
time for all the questions that he immediately wished to ask
All in good time said Gandalf Things are drawing towards the end now
unless I am mistaken There is an unpleasant time just in front of you but keep
your heart up You may come through all right There is news brewing that even
the ravens have not heard Good night
Puzzled but cheered Bilbo hurried on He was guided to a safe ford and set
across dry and then he said farewell to the elves and climbed carefully back
towards the Gate Great weariness began to come over him but it was well
before midnight when he clambered up the rope againit was still where he had
left it He untied it and hid it and then he sat down on the wall and wondered
anxiously what would happen next
At midnight he woke up Bombur and then in turn rolled himself up in his
corner without listening to the old dwarfs thanks which he felt he had hardly
earned He was soon fast asleep forgetting all his worries till the morning As a
matter of fact he was dreaming of eggs and bacon
