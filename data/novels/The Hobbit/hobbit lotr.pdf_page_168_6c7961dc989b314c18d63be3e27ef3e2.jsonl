to venture very far that way nor was there much use in it Out up there a silence
reigned broken by no bird or sound except that of the wind in the crannies of
stone They spoke low and never called or sang for danger brooded in every
rock The others who were busy with the secret of the door had no more success
They were too eager to trouble about the runes or the moonletters but tried
without resting to discover where exactly in the smooth face of the rock the door
was hidden They had brought picks and tools of many sorts from Laketown
and at first they tried to use these But when they struck the stone the handles
splintered and jarred their arms cruelly and the steel heads broke or bent like
lead Mining work they saw clearly was no good against the magic that had
shut this door and they grew terrified too of the echoing noise
Bilbo found sitting on the doorstep lonesome and wearisomethere was not
a doorstep of course really but they used to call the little grassy space between
the wall and the opening the doorstep in fun remembering Bilbos words long
ago at the unexpected party in his hobbithole when he said they could sit on the
doorstep till they thought of something And sit and think they did or wandered
aimlessly about and glummer and glummer they became
Their spirits had risen a little at the discovery of the path but now they sank
into their boots and yet they would not give it up and go away The hobbit was
no longer much brighter than the dwarves He would do nothing but sit with his
back to the rockface and stare away west through the opening over the cliff
over the wide lands to the black wall of Mirkwood and to the distances beyond
in which he sometimes thought he could catch glimpses of the Misty Mountains
small and far If the dwarves asked him what he was doing he answered
You said sitting on the doorstep and thinking would be my job not to
mention getting inside so I am sitting and thinking But I am afraid he was not
thinking much of the job but of what lay beyond the blue distance the quiet
Western Land and the Hill and his hobbithole under it
A large grey stone lay in the centre of the grass and he stared moodily at it or
watched the great snails They seemed to love the little shutin bay with its walls
of cool rock and there were many of them of huge size crawling slowly and
stickily along its sides
