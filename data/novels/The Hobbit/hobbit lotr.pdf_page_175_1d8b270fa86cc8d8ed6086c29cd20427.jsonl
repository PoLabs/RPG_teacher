not do to leave a live dragon out of your calculations if you live near him
Dragons may not have much real use for all their wealth but they know it to an
ounce as a rule especially after long possession and Smaug was no exception
He had passed from an uneasy dream in which a warrior altogether
insignificant in size but provided with a bitter sword and great courage figured
most unpleasantly to a doze and from a doze to wide waking There was a
breath of strange air in his cave Could there be a draught from that little hole
He had never felt quite happy about it though it was so small and now he glared
at it in suspicion and wondered why he had never blocked it up Of late he had
half fancied he had caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound from far above
that came down through it to his lair He stirred and stretched forth his neck to
sniff Then he missed the cup
Thieves Fire Murder Such a thing had not happened since first he came to
the Mountain His rage passes descriptionthe sort of rage that is only seen
when rich folk that have more than they can enjoy suddenly lose something that
they have long had but have never before used or wanted His fire belched forth
the hall smoked he shook the mountainroots He thrust his head in vain at the
little hole and then coiling his length together roaring like thunder underground
he sped from his deep lair through its great door out into the huge passages of
the mountainpalace and up towards the Front Gate
To hunt the whole mountain till he had caught the thief and had torn and
trampled him was his one thought He issued from the Gate the waters rose in
fierce whistling steam and up he soared blazing into the air and settled on the
mountaintop in a spout of green and scarlet flame The dwarves heard the awful
rumour of his flight and they crouched against the walls of the grassy terrace
cringing under boulders hoping somehow to escape the frightful eyes of the
hunting dragon
There they would have all been killed if it had not been for Bilbo once again
Quick Quick he gasped The door The tunnel Its no good here
Roused by these words they were just about to creep inside the tunnel when
Bifur gave a cry My cousins Bombur and Bofurwe have forgotten them
they are down in the valley
They will be slain and all our ponies too and all our stores lost moaned
the others We can do nothing
Nonsense said Thorin recovering his dignity We cannot leave them Get
inside Mr Baggins and Balin and you two Fili and Kilithe dragon shant have
all of us Now you others where are the ropes Be quick
