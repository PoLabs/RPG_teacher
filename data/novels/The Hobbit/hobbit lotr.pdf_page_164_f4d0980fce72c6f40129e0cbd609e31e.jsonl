Thorin told them it had been green and fair There was little grass and before
long there was neither bush nor tree and only broken and blackened stumps to
speak of ones long vanished They were come to the Desolation of the Dragon
and they were come at the waning of the year
They reached the skirts of the Mountain all the same without meeting any danger
or any sign of the Dragon other than the wilderness he had made about his lair
The Mountain lay dark and silent before them and ever higher above them They
made their first camp on the western side of the great southern spur which ended
in a height called Ravenhill On this there had been an old watchpost but they
dared not climb it yet it was too exposed
Before setting out to search the western spurs of the Mountain for the hidden
door on which all their hopes rested Thorin sent out a scouting expedition to
spy out the land to the South where the Front Gate stood For this purpose he
chose Balin and Fili and Kili and with them went Bilbo They marched under
the grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill There the river after winding a
wide loop over the valley of Dale turned from the Mountain on its road to the
Lake flowing swift and noisily Its bank was bare and rocky tall and steep above
the stream and gazing out from it over the narrow water foaming and splashing
among many boulders they could see in the wide valley shadowed by the
Mountains arms the grey ruins of ancient houses towers and walls
There lies all that is left of Dale said Balin The mountains sides were
green with woods and all the sheltered valley rich and pleasant in the days when
the bells rang in that town He looked both sad and grim as he said this he had
been one of Thorins companions on the day the Dragon came
They did not dare to follow the river much further towards the Gate but they
went on beyond the end of the southern spur until lying hidden behind a rock
they could look out and see the dark cavernous opening in a great cliffwall
between the arms of the Mountain Out of it the waters of the Running River
sprang and out of it too there came a steam and a dark smoke Nothing moved
in the waste save the vapour and the water and every now and again a black and
ominous crow The only sound was the sound of the stony water and every now
and again the harsh croak of a bird Balin shuddered
Let us return he said We can do no good here And I dont like these
dark birds they look like spies of evil
