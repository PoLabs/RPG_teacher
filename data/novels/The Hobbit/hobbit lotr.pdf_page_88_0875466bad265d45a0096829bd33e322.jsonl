places It was high summer and on this eastern side of the mountains there had
been little rain for some time Yellowing bracken fallen branches deeppiled
pineneedles and here and there dead trees were soon in flames All round the
clearing of the Wargs fire was leaping But the wolfguards did not leave the
trees Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks and
cursing the dwarves in their horrible language with their tongues hanging out
and their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames
Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling They thought a battle with
the woodmen was going on but they soon learned what had really happened
Some of them actually sat down and laughed Others waved their spears and
clashed the shafts against their shields Goblins are not afraid of fire and they
soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing
Some got all the wolves together in a pack Some stacked fern and
brushwood round the treetrunks Others rushed round and stamped and beat
and beat and stamped until nearly all the flames were put outbut they did not
put out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were That fire they fed
with leaves and dead branches and bracken Soon they had a ring of smoke and
flame all round the dwarves a ring which they kept from spreading outwards
but it closed slowly in till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the
trees Smoke was in Bilbos eyes he could feel the heat of the flames and
through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle
like people round a midsummer bonfire Outside the ring of dancing warriors
with spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance watching and
waiting
He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song
Fifteen birds in five firtrees
their feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze
But funny little birds they had no wings
O what shall we do with the funny little things
Roast em alive or stew them in a pot
fry them boil them and eat them hot
Then they stopped and shouted out Fly away little birds Fly away if you
can Come down little birds or you will get roasted in your nests Sing sing
little birds Why dont you sing
