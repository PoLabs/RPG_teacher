help the hobbit although he was feeling very sick and ill from spiderpoison and
from hanging most of the night and the next day wound round and round with
only his nose to breathe through It took him ages to get the beastly stuff out of
his eyes and eyebrows and as for his beard he had to cut most of it off Well
between them they started to haul up first one dwarf and then another and slash
them free None of them were better off than Fili and some of them were worse
Some had hardly been able to breathe at all long noses are sometimes useful
you see and some had been more poisoned
In this way they rescued Kili Bifur Bofur Dori and Nori Poor old Bombur
was so exhaustedhe was the fattest and had been constantly pinched and
pokedthat he just rolled off the branch and fell plop on to the ground
fortunately on to leaves and lay there But there were still five dwarves hanging
at the end of the branch when the spiders began to come back more full of rage
than ever
Bilbo immediately went to the end of the branch nearest the treetrunk and
kept back those that crawled up He had taken off his ring when he rescued Fili
and forgotten to put it on again so now they all began to splutter and hiss
Now we see you you nasty little creature We will eat you and leave your
bones and skin hanging on a tree Ugh hes got a sting has he Well well get
him all the same and then well hang him head downwards for a day or two
While this was going on the other dwarves were working at the rest of the
captives and cutting at the threads with their knives Soon all would be free
though it was not clear what would happen after that The spiders had caught
them pretty easily the night before but that had been unawares and in the dark
This time there looked like being a horrible battle
Suddenly Bilbo noticed that some of the spiders had gathered round old
Bombur on the floor and had tied him up again and were dragging him away He
gave a shout and slashed at the spiders in front of him They quickly gave way
and he scrambled and fell down the tree right into the middle of those on the
ground His little sword was something new in the way of stings for them How
it darted to and fro It shone with delight as he stabbed at them Half a dozen
were killed before the rest drew off and left Bombur to Bilbo
Come down Come down he shouted to the dwarves on the branch Dont
stay up there and be netted For he saw spiders swarming up all the
neighbouring trees and crawling along the boughs above the heads of the
dwarves
Down the dwarves scrambled or jumped or dropped eleven all in a heap
