for Bilbo
Up you two get and off we go said Thorin
Im awfully sorry said Bilbo but I have come without my hat and I have
left my pockethandkerchief behind and I havent got any money I didnt get
your note until after 1045 to be precise
Dont be precise said Dwalin and dont worry You will have to manage
without pockethandkerchiefs and a good many other things before you get to
the journeys end As for a hat I have got a spare hood and cloak in my
luggage
Thats how they all came to start jogging off from the inn one fine morning
just before May on laden ponies and Bilbo was wearing a darkgreen hood a
little weatherstained and a darkgreen cloak borrowed from Dwalin They were
too large for him and he looked rather comic What his father Bungo would
have thought of him I darent think His only comfort was he couldnt be
mistaken for a dwarf as he had no beard
They had not been riding very long when up came Gandalf very splendid on
a white horse He had brought a lot of pockethandkerchiefs and Bilbos pipe
and tobacco So after that the party went along very merrily and they told stories
or sang songs as they rode forward all day except of course when they stopped
for meals These didnt come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them but
still he began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all
At first they had passed through hobbitlands a wide respectable country
inhabited by decent folk with good roads an inn or two and now and then a
dwarf or a farmer ambling by on business Then they came to lands where
people spoke strangely and sang songs Bilbo had never heard before Now they
had gone on far into the Lonelands where there were no people left no inns
and the roads grew steadily worse Not far ahead were dreary hills rising higher
and higher dark with trees On some of them were old castles with an evil look
as if they had been built by wicked people Everything seemed gloomy for the
weather that day had taken a nasty turn Mostly it had been as good as May can
be can be even in merry tales but now it was cold and wet In the Lonelands
they had been obliged to camp when they could but at least it had been dry
To think it will soon be June grumbled Bilbo as he splashed along behind
the others in a very muddy track It was after teatime it was pouring with rain
and had been all day his hood was dripping into his eyes his cloak was full of
water the pony was tired and stumbled on stones the others were too grumpy to
talk And Im sure the rain has got into the dry clothes and into the foodbags
