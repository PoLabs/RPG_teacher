Sorry I dont want any adventures thank you Not today Good morning
But please come to teaany time you like Why not tomorrow Come
tomorrow Good bye With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round
green door and shut it as quickly as he dared not to seem rude Wizards after all
are wizards
What on earth did I ask him to tea for he said to himself as he went to the
pantry He had only just had breakfast but he thought a cake or two and a drink
of something would do him good after his fright
Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door and laughing
long but quietly After a while he stepped up and with the spike on his staff
scratched a queer sign on the hobbits beautiful green frontdoor Then he strode
away just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and
beginning to think that he had escaped adventures very well
The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf He did not remember
things very well unless he put them down on his Engagement Tablet like this
Gandalf Tea Wednesday Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of
the kind
Just before teatime there came a tremendous ring on the frontdoor bell and
then he remembered He rushed and put on the kettle and put out another cup
and saucer and an extra cake or two and ran to the door
I am so sorry to keep you waiting he was going to say when he saw that it
was not Gandalf at all It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden
belt and very bright eyes under his darkgreen hood As soon as the door was
opened he pushed inside just as if he had been expected
He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg and Dwalin at your service
he said with a low bow
Bilbo Baggins at yours said the hobbit too surprised to ask any questions
for the moment When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable he
added I am just about to take tea pray come and have some with me A little
stiff perhaps but he meant it kindly And what would you do if an uninvited
dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation
They had not been at table long in fact they had hardly reached the third
cake when there came another even louder ring at the bell
Excuse me said the hobbit and off he went to the door
So you have got here at last That was what he was going to say to Gandalf
this time But it was not Gandalf Instead there was a very oldlooking dwarf on
the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood and he too hopped inside as soon
