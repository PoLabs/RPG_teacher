long time at any rate After blundering frantically in the gloom falling over logs
bumping crash into trees and shouting and calling till they must have waked
everything in the forest for miles at last they managed to gather themselves in a
bundle and count themselves by touch By that time they had of course quite
forgotten in what direction the path lay and they were all hopelessly lost at least
till morning
There was nothing for it but to settle down for the night where they were
they did not even dare to search on the ground for scraps of food for fear of
becoming separated again But they had not been lying long and Bilbo was only
just getting drowsy when Dori whose turn it was to watch first said in a loud
whisper
The lights are coming out again over there and there are more than ever of
them
Up they all jumped There sure enough not far away were scores of
twinkling lights and they heard the voices and the laughter quite plainly They
crept slowly towards them in a single line each touching the back of the one in
front When they got near Thorin said No rushing forward this time No one is
to stir from hiding till I say I shall send Mr Baggins alone first to talk to them
They wont be frightened of himWhat about me of them thought Bilbo
and any way I hope they wont do anything nasty to him
When they got to the edge of the circle of lights they pushed Bilbo suddenly
from behind Before he had time to slip on his ring he stumbled forward into the
full blaze of the fire and torches It was no good Out went all the lights again
and complete darkness fell
If it had been difficult collecting themselves before it was far worse this
time And they simply could not find the hobbit Every time they counted
themselves it only made thirteen They shouted and called Bilbo Baggins
Hobbit You dratted hobbit Hi hobbit confusticate you where are you and
other things of that sort but there was no answer
They were just giving up hope when Dori stumbled across him by sheer
luck In the dark he fell over what he thought was a log and he found it was the
hobbit curled up fast asleep It took a deal of shaking to wake him and when he
was awake he was not pleased at all
I was having such a lovely dream he grumbled all about having a most
gorgeous dinner
Good heavens he has gone like Bombur they said Dont tell us about
dreams Dreamdinners arent any good and we cant share them
