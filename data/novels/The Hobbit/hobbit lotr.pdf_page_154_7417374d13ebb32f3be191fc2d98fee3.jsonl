were a few huts and buildings there but right out on the surface of the lake
protected from the swirl of the entering river by a promontory of rock which
formed a calm bay A great bridge made of wood ran out to where on huge piles
made of forest trees was built a busy wooden town not a town of elves but of
Men who still dared to dwell here under the shadow of the distant dragon
mountain They still throve on the trade that came up the great river from the
South and was carted past the falls to their town but in the great days of old
when Dale in the North was rich and prosperous they had been wealthy and
powerful and there had been fleets of boats on the waters and some were filled
with gold and some with warriors in armour and there had been wars and deeds
which were now only a legend The rotting piles of a greater town could still be
seen along the shores when the waters sank in a drought
But men remembered little of all that though some still sang old songs of the
dwarfkings of the Mountain Thror and Thrain of the race of Durin and of the
coming of the Dragon and the fall of the lords of Dale Some sang too that Thror
and Thrain would come back one day and gold would flow in rivers through the
mountaingates and all that land would be filled with new song and new
laughter But this pleasant legend did not much affect their daily business
