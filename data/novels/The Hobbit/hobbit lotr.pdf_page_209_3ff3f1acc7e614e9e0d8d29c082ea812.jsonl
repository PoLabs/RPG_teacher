Again Thorin hailed them in a loud voice Who are you that come armed for
war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain King under the Mountain This time
he was answered
A tall man stood forward dark of hair and grim of face and he cried Hail
Thorin Why do you fence yourself like a robber in his hold We are not yet
foes and we rejoice that you are alive beyond our hope We came expecting to
find none living here yet now that we are met there is matter for a parley and a
council
Who are you and of what would you parley
I am Bard and by my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure
delivered Is that not a matter that concerns you Moreover I am by right descent
the heir of Girion of Dale and in your hoard is mingled much of the wealth of
his halls and towns which of old Smaug stole Is not that a matter of which we
may speak Further in his last battle Smaug destroyed the dwellings of the men
of Esgaroth and I am yet the servant of their Master I would speak for him and
ask whether you have no thought for the sorrow and misery of his people They
aided you in your distress and in recompense you have thus far brought ruin
only though doubtless undesigned
Now these were fair words and true if proudly and grimly spoken and Bilbo
thought that Thorin would at once admit what justice was in them He did not of
course expect that any one would remember that it was he who discovered all
by himself the dragons weak spot and that was just as well for no one ever did
But also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon has
long brooded nor with dwarvish hearts Long hours in the past days Thorin had
spent in the treasury and the lust of it was heavy on him Though he had hunted
chiefly for the Arkenstone yet he had an eye for many another wonderful thing
that was lying there about which were wound old memories of the labours and
the sorrows of his race
You put your worst cause last and in the chief place Thorin answered To
the treasure of my people no man has a claim because Smaug who stole it from
us also robbed him of life or home The treasure was not his that his evil deeds
should be amended with a share of it The price of the goods and the assistance
that we received of the Lakemen we will fairly payin due time But nothing
will we give not even a loafs worth under threat of force While an armed host
lies before our doors we look on you as foes and thieves
It is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have paid
to our kindred had you found the hoard unguarded and us slain
