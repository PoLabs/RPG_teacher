hurried a little getting as close as he dared behind Gollum who was still going
quickly not looking back but turning his head from side to side as Bilbo could
see from the faint glimmer on the walls
My birthdaypresent Curse it How did we lose it my precious Yes thats
it When we came this way last when we twisted that nassty young squeaker
Thats it Curse it It slipped from us after all these ages and ages Its gone
gollum
Suddenly Gollum sat down and began to weep a whistling and gurgling
sound horrible to listen to Bilbo halted and flattened himself against the tunnel
wall After a while Gollum stopped weeping and began to talk He seemed to be
having an argument with himself
Its no good going back there to search no We doesnt remember all the
places weve visited And its no use The Baggins has got it in its pocketses the
nassty noser has found it we says
We guesses precious only guesses We cant know till we find the nassty
creature and squeezes it But it doesnt know what the present can do does it
Itll just keep it in its pocketses It doesnt know and it cant go far Its lost
itself the nassty nosey thing It doesnt know the way out It said so
It said so yes but its tricksy It doesnt say what it means It wont say
what its got in its pocketses It knows It knows a way in it must know a way
out yes Its off to the backdoor To the backdoor thats it
The goblinses will catch it then It cant get out that way precious
Ssss sss gollum Goblinses Yes but if its got the present our precious
present then goblinses will get it gollum Theyll find it theyll find out what it
does We shant ever be safe again never gollum One of the goblinses will put
it on and then no one will see him Hell be there but not seen Not even our
clever eyeses will notice him and hell come creepsy and tricksy and catch us
gollum gollum
Then lets stop talking precious and make haste If the Baggins has gone
that way we must go quick and see Go Not far now Make haste
With a spring Gollum got up and started shambling off at a great pace Bilbo
hurried after him still cautiously though his chief fear now was of tripping on
another snag and falling with a noise His head was in a whirl of hope and
wonder It seemed that the ring he had was a magic ring it made you invisible
He had heard of such things of course in old old tales but it was hard to believe
that he really had found one by accident Still there it was Gollum with his
bright eyes had passed him by only a yard to one side
