the hunt and the white deer that had appeared upon their path they would have
known that they were at last drawing towards the eastern edge and would soon
have come if they could have kept up their courage and their hope to thinner
trees and places where the sunlight came again
But they did not know this and they were burdened with the heavy body of
Bombur which they had to carry along with them as best they could taking the
wearisome task in turns of four each while the others shared their packs If these
had not become all too light in the last few days they would never have
managed it but a slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor exchange for
packs filled with food however heavy In a few days a time came when there was
practically nothing left to eat or to drink Nothing wholesome could they see
growing in the wood only funguses and herbs with pale leaves and unpleasant
smell
About four days from the enchanted stream they came to a part where most
of the trees were beeches They were at first inclined to be cheered by the
change for here there was no undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep
There was a greenish light about them and in places they could see some
distance to either side of the path Yet the light only showed them endless lines
of straight grey trunks like the pillars of some huge twilight hall There was a
breath of air and a noise of wind but it had a sad sound A few leaves came
rustling down to remind them that outside autumn was coming on Their feet
ruffled among the dead leaves of countless other autumns that drifted over the
banks of the path from the deep red carpets of the forest
Still Bombur slept and they grew very weary At times they heard disquieting
laughter Sometimes there was singing in the distance too The laughter was the
laughter of fair voices not of goblins and the singing was beautiful but it
sounded eerie and strange and they were not comforted rather they hurried on
from those parts with what strength they had left
Two days later they found their path going downwards and before long they
were in a valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks
Is there no end to this accursed forest said Thorin Somebody must climb
a tree and see if he can get his head above the roof and have a look round The
only way is to choose the tallest tree that overhangs the path
Of course somebody meant Bilbo They chose him because to be of any
use the climber must get his head above the topmost leaves and so he must be
light enough for the highest and slenderest branches to bear him Poor Mr
Baggins had never had much practice in climbing trees but they hoisted him up
