Chapter III
A SHORT REST
They did not sing or tell stories that day even though the weather improved nor
the next day nor the day after They had begun to feel that danger was not far
away on either side They camped under the stars and their horses had more to
eat than they had for there was plenty of grass but there was not much in their
bags even with what they had got from the trolls One morning they forded a
river at a wide shallow place full of the noise of stones and foam The far bank
was steep and slippery When they got to the top of it leading their ponies they
saw that the great mountains had marched down very near to them Already they
seemed only a days easy journey from the feet of the nearest Dark and drear it
looked though there were patches of sunlight on its brown sides and behind its
shoulders the tips of snowpeaks gleamed
Is that The Mountain asked Bilbo in a solemn voice looking at it with
round eyes He had never seen a thing that looked so big before
Of course not said Balin That is only the beginning of the Misty
Mountains and we have got to get through or over or under those somehow
before we can come into Wilderland beyond And it is a deal of a way even from
the other side of them to the Lonely Mountain in the East where Smaug lies on
our treasure
O said Bilbo and just at that moment he felt more tired than he ever
remembered feeling before He was thinking once again of his comfortable chair
before the fire in his favourite sittingroom in his hobbithole and of the kettle
singing Not for the last time
Now Gandalf led the way We must not miss the road or we shall be done for
