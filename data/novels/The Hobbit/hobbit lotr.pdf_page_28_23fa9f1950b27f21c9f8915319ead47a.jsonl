And isnt sitting on the doorstep your job not to speak of getting inside the
door But I agree about bed and breakfast I like six eggs with my ham when
starting on a journey fried not poached and mind you dont break em
After all the others had ordered their breakfasts without so much as a please
which annoyed Bilbo very much they all got up The hobbit had to find room
for them all and filled all his sparerooms and made beds on chairs and sofas
before he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed very tired and not
altogether happy One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to
get up very early and cook everybody elses wretched breakfast The
Tookishness was wearing off and he was not now quite so sure that he was
going on any journey in the morning
As he lay in bed he could hear Thorin still humming to himself in the best
bedroom next to him
Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To find our longforgotten gold
Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears and it gave him very uncomfortable
dreams It was long after the break of day when he woke up
