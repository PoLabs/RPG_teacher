The old Master had come to a bad end Bard had given him much gold for the
help of the Lakepeople but being of the kind that easily catches such disease he
fell under the dragonsickness and took most of the gold and fled with it and
died of starvation in the Waste deserted by his companions
The new Master is of wiser kind said Balin and very popular for of
course he gets most of the credit for the present prosperity They are making
songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold
Then the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true after a
fashion said Bilbo
Of course said Gandalf And why should not they prove true Surely you
dont disbelieve the prophecies because you had a hand in bringing them about
yourself You dont really suppose do you that all your adventures and escapes
were managed by mere luck just for your sole benefit You are a very fine
person Mr Baggins and I am very fond of you but you are only quite a little
fellow in a wide world after all
Thank goodness said Bilbo laughing and handed him the tobaccojar
