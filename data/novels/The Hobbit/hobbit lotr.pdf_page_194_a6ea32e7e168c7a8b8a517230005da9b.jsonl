Come come said Thorin laughinghis spirits had begun to rise again
and he rattled the precious stones in his pockets Dont call my palace a nasty
hole You wait till it has been cleaned and redecorated
That wont be till Smaugs dead said Bilbo glumly In the meanwhile
where is he I would give a good breakfast to know I hope he is not up on the
Mountain looking down at us
That idea disturbed the dwarves mightily and they quickly decided that Bilbo
and Balin were right
We must move away from here said Dori I feel as if his eyes were on the
