he felt something touch him Something like a strong sticky string was against
his left hand and when he tried to move he found that his legs were already
wrapped in the same stuff so that when he got up he fell over
Then the great spider who had been busy tying him up while he dozed came
from behind him and came at him He could only see the things eyes but he
