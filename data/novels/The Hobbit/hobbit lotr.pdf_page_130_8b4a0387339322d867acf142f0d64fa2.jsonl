With that he turned and found that the last space between two tall trees had
been closed with a webbut luckily not a proper web only great strands of
doublethick spiderrope run hastily backwards and forwards from trunk to

singing
The spiders saw the sword though I dont suppose they knew what it was
and at once the whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit along the
ground and the branches hairy legs waving nippers and spinners snapping eyes
