called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator though no noise came out
he was so flummoxed So Thorin went on
We are met to discuss our plans our ways means policy and devices We
shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey a journey from
which some of us or perhaps all of us except our friend and counsellor the
ingenious wizard Gandalf may never return It is a solemn moment Our object
is I take it well known to us all To the estimable Mr Baggins and perhaps to
one or two of the younger dwarves I think I should be right in naming Kili and
Fili for instance the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief
explanation
This was Thorins style He was an important dwarf If he had been allowed
he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath without
telling any one there anything that was not known already But he was rudely
interrupted Poor Bilbo couldnt bear it any longer At may never return he began
to feel a shriek coming up inside and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an
engine coming out of a tunnel All the dwarves sprang up knocking over the
table Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff and in its
firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearthrug
shaking like a jelly that was melting Then he fell flat on the floor and kept on
calling out struck by lightning struck by lightning over and over again and
that was all they could get out of him for a long time So they took him and laid
him out of the way on the drawingroom sofa with a drink at his elbow and they
went back to their dark business
Excitable little fellow said Gandalf as they sat down again Gets funny
queer fits but he is one of the best one of the bestas fierce as a dragon in a
pinch
If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch you will realize that this was only
poetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit even to Old Tooks greatgrand
uncle Bullroarer who was so huge for a hobbit that he could ride a horse He
charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green
Fields and knocked their king Golfimbuls head clean off with a wooden club It
sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbithole and in this
way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment
In the meanwhile however Bullroarers gentler descendant was reviving in
the drawingroom After a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the
parlour This is what he heard Gloin speaking Humph or some snort more
or less like that Will he do do you think It is all very well for Gandalf to talk
