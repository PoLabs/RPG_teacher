they expected that only the Front Gate remained open all the other gates
except of course the small secret door had long ago been broken and blocked
by Smaug and no sign of them remained So now they began to labour hard in
fortifying the main entrance and in making a new path that led from it Tools
were to be found in plenty that the miners and quarriers and builders of old had
used and at such work the dwarves were still very skilled
As they worked the ravens brought them constant tidings In this way they
learned that the Elvenking had turned aside to the Lake and they still had a

South
There came a night when suddenly there were many lights as of fires and torches
away south in Dale before them
They have come called Balin And their camp is very great They must
have come into the valley under the cover of dusk along both banks of the river
That night the dwarves slept little The morning was still pale when they saw
