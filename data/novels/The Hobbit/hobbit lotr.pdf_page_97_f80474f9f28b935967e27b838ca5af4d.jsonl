rug cape tippet muff nor any other such unfortunate word He is a skin
changer He changes his skin sometimes he is a huge black bear sometimes he
is a great strong blackhaired man with huge arms and a great beard I cannot tell
you much more though that ought to be enough Some say that he is a bear
descended from the great and ancient bears of the mountains that lived there
before the giants came Others say that he is a man descended from the first men
who lived before Smaug or the other dragons came into this part of the world
and before the goblins came into the hills out of the North I cannot say though I
fancy the last is the true tale He is not the sort of person to ask questions of
At any rate he is under no enchantment but his own He lives in an oak
wood and has a great wooden house and as a man he keeps cattle and horses
which are nearly as marvellous as himself They work for him and talk to him
He does not eat them neither does he hunt or eat wild animals He keeps hives
and hives of great fierce bees and lives most on cream and honey As a bear he
ranges far and wide I once saw him sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock at
night watching the moon sinking towards the Misty Mountains and I heard him
growl in the tongue of bears The day will come when they will perish and I
shall go back That is why I believe he once came from the mountains himself
Bilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think about and they asked no more
questions They still had a long way to walk before them Up slope and down
dale they plodded It grew very hot Sometimes they rested under the trees and
then Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have eaten acorns if any had been ripe
enough yet to have fallen to the ground
It was the middle of the afternoon before they noticed that great patches of
flowers had begun to spring up all the same kinds growing together as if they
had been planted Especially there was clover waving patches of cockscomb
clover and purple clover and wide stretches of short white sweet honey
smelling clover There was a buzzing and a whirring and a droning in the air
Bees were busy everywhere And such bees Bilbo had never seen anything like
them
If one was to sting me he thought I should swell up as big again as I
am
They were bigger than hornets The drones were bigger than your thumb a
good deal and the bands of yellow on their deep black bodies shone like fiery
gold
