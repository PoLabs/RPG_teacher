worst description Before you could get round it in the South you would get into
the land of the Necromancer and even you Bilbo wont need me to tell you
tales of that black sorcerer I dont advise you to go anywhere near the places
overlooked by his dark tower Stick to the foresttrack keep your spirits up
hope for the best and with a tremendous slice of luck you may come out one day
and see the Long Marshes lying below you and beyond them high in the East
the Lonely Mountain where dear old Smaug lives though I hope he is not
expecting you
Very comforting you are to be sure growled Thorin Goodbye If you
wont come with us you had better get off without any more talk
Goodbye then and really goodbye said Gandalf and he turned his horse
and rode down into the West But he could not resist the temptation to have the
last word Before he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put his hands
to his mouth and called to them They heard his voice come faintly Goodbye
Be good take care of yourselvesand DONT LEAVE THE PATH
Then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight O goodbye and go
away grunted the dwarves all the more angry because they were really filled
with dismay at losing him Now began the most dangerous part of all the
journey They each shouldered the heavy pack and the waterskin which was
their share and turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged
into the forest
