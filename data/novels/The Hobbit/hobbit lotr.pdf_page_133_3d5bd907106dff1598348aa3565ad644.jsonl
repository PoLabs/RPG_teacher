Go on Go on he shouted I will do the stinging
And he did He darted backwards and forwards slashing at spiderthreads
hacking at their legs and stabbing at their fat bodies if they came too near The
spiders swelled with rage and spluttered and frothed and hissed out horrible
curses but they had become mortally afraid of Sting and dared not come very
near now that it had come back So curse as they would their prey moved
slowly but steadily away It was a most terrible business and seemed to take
hours But at last just when Bilbo felt that he could not lift his hand for a single
stroke more the spiders suddenly gave it up and followed them no more but
went back disappointed to their dark colony
The dwarves then noticed that they had come to the edge of a ring where elf
fires had been Whether it was one of those they had seen the night before they
could not tell But it seemed that some good magic lingered in such spots which
the spiders did not like At any rate here the light was greener and the boughs
less thick and threatening and they had a chance to rest and draw breath
There they lay for some time puffing and panting But very soon they began
to ask questions They had to have the whole vanishing business carefully
explained and the finding of the ring interested them so much that for a while
they forgot their own troubles Balin in particular insisted on having the Gollum
story riddles and all told all over again with the ring in its proper place But
after a time the light began to fail and then other questions were asked Where
were they and where was their path and where was there any food and what
were they going to do next These questions they asked over and over again and
it was from little Bilbo that they seemed to expect to get the answers From
which you can see that they had changed their opinion of Mr Baggins very
much and had begun to have a great respect for him as Gandalf had said they
would Indeed they really expected him to think of some wonderful plan for
helping them and were not merely grumbling They knew only too well that
they would soon all have been dead if it had not been for the hobbit and they
thanked him many times Some of them even got up and bowed right to the
ground before him though they fell over with the effort and could not get on
their legs again for some time Knowing the truth about the vanishing did not
lessen their opinion of Bilbo at all for they saw that he had some wits as well as
luck and a magic ringand all three are very useful possessions In fact they
praised him so much that Bilbo began to feel there really was something of a
bold adventurer about himself after all though he would have felt a lot bolder
still if there had been anything to eat
