straight at him without noticing him
I will give them all a surprise he thought as he crawled into the bushes at
the edge of the dell Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves They were
discussing all that had happened to them in the tunnels and wondering and
debating what they were to do now The dwarves were grumbling and Gandalf
was saying that they could not possibly go on with their journey leaving Mr
Baggins in the hands of the goblins without trying to find out if he was alive or
dead and without trying to rescue him
After all he is my friend said the wizard and not a bad little chap I feel
responsible for him I wish to goodness you had not lost him
The dwarves wanted to know why he had ever been brought at all why he
could not stick to his friends and come along with them and why the wizard had
not chosen someone with more sense He has been more trouble than use so
far said one If we have got to go back now into those abominable tunnels to
look for him then drat him I say
Gandalf answered angrily I brought him and I dont bring things that are of
no use Either you help me to look for him or I go and leave you here to get out
of the mess as best you can yourselves If we can only find him again you will
thank me before all is over Whatever did you want to go and drop him for
Dori
You would have dropped him said Dori if a goblin had suddenly grabbed
your legs from behind in the dark tripped up your feet and kicked you in the
back
Then why didnt you pick him up again
Good heavens Can you ask Goblins fighting and biting in the dark
everybody falling over bodies and hitting one another You nearly chopped off
my head with Glamdring and Thorin was stabbing here there and everywhere
with Orcrist All of a sudden you gave one of your blinding flashes and we saw
the goblins running back yelping You shouted follow me everybody and
everybody ought to have followed We thought everybody had There was no
time to count as you know quite well till we had dashed through the gate
guards out of the lower door and helterskelter down here And here we are
without the burglar confusticate him
And heres the burglar said Bilbo stepping down into the middle of them
and slipping off the ring
Bless me how they jumped Then they shouted with surprise and delight
Gandalf was as astonished as any of them but probably more pleased than all
