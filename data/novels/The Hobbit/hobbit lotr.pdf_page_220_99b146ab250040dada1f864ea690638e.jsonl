of iron and they were shod with iron and their faces were grim
Trumpets called men and elves to arms Before long the dwarves could be
seen coming up the valley at a great pace They halted between the river and the
eastern spur but a few held on their way and crossing the river drew near the
camp and there they laid down their weapons and held up their hands in sign of
peace Bard went out to meet them and with him went Bilbo
We are sent from Dain son of Nain they said when questioned We are
hastening to our kinsmen in the Mountain since we learn that the kingdom of
old is renewed But who are you that sit in the plain as foes before defended
walls This of course in the polite and rather oldfashioned language of such
occasions meant simply You have no business here We are going on so make
way or we shall fight you They meant to push on between the Mountain and
the loop of the river for the narrow land there did not seem to be strongly
guarded
Bard of course refused to allow the dwarves to go straight on to the
Mountain He was determined to wait until the gold and silver had been brought
out in exchange for the Arkenstone for he did not believe that this would be
done if once the fortress was manned with so large and warlike a company
They had brought with them a great store of supplies for the dwarves can carry
very heavy burdens and nearly all of Dains folk in spite of their rapid march
bore huge packs on their backs in addition to their weapons They would stand a
siege for weeks and by that time yet more dwarves might come and yet more
for Thorin had many relatives Also they would be able to reopen and guard
some other gate so that the besiegers would have to encircle the whole
mountain and for that they had not sufficient numbers
These were in fact precisely their plans for the ravenmessengers had been
busy between Thorin and Dain but for the moment the way was barred so after
angry words the dwarfmessengers retired muttering in their beards Bard then
sent messengers at once to the Gate but they found no gold or payment Arrows
came forth as soon as they were within shot and they hastened back in dismay
In the camp all was now astir as if for battle for the dwarves of Dain were
advancing along the eastern bank
Fools laughed Bard to come thus beneath the Mountains arm They do
not understand war above ground whatever they may know of battle in the
mines There are many of our archers and spearmen now hidden in the rocks
upon their right flank Dwarfmail may be good but they will soon be hard put
to it Let us set on them now from both sides before they are fully rested
