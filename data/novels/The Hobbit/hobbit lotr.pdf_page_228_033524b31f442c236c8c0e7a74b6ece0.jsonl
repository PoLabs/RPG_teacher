parted in kindness You are a fool Bilbo Baggins and you made a great mess of
that business with the stone and there was a battle in spite of all your efforts to
buy peace and quiet but I suppose you can hardly be blamed for that
All that had happened after he was stunned Bilbo learned later but it gave him
more sorrow than joy and he was now weary of his adventure He was aching in
his bones for the homeward journey That however was a little delayed so in
the meantime I will tell something of events The Eagles had long had suspicion
of the goblins mustering from their watchfulness the movements in the
mountains could not be altogether hid So they too had gathered in great
numbers under the great Eagle of the Misty Mountains and at length smelling
battle from afar they had come speeding down the gale in the nick of time They
it was who dislodged the goblins from the mountainslopes casting them over
precipices or driving them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes It
was not long before they had freed the Lonely Mountain and elves and men on
either side of the valley could come at last to the help of the battle below
But even with the Eagles they were still outnumbered In that last hour Beorn
himself had appearedno one knew how or from where He came alone and in
bears shape and he seemed to have grown almost to giantsize in his wrath
The roar of his voice was like drums and guns and he tossed wolves and
goblins from his path like straws and feathers He fell upon their rear and broke
like a clap of thunder through the ring The dwarves were making a stand still
about their lords upon a low rounded hill Then Beorn stooped and lifted Thorin
who had fallen pierced with spears and bore him out of the fray
Swiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled so that nothing could
withstand him and no weapon seemed to bite upon him He scattered the
bodyguard and pulled down Bolg himself and crushed him Then dismay fell on
the Goblins and they fled in all directions But weariness left their enemies with
the coming of new hope and they pursued them closely and prevented most of
them from escaping where they could They drove many of them into the
Running River and such as fled south or west they hunted into the marshes
about the Forest River and there the greater part of the last fugitives perished
while those that came hardly to the Woodelves realm were there slain or drawn
in to die deep in the trackless dark of Mirkwood Songs have said that three parts
of the goblin warriors of the North perished on that day and the mountains had
peace for many a year
