before the mouth of a huge cave that ran into the side of a steep slope covered
with trees There the great beeches came right down to the bank till their feet
were in the stream
Across the bridge the elves thrust their prisoners but Bilbo hesitated in the
rear He did not at all like the look of the cavernmouth and he only made up his
mind not to desert his friends just in time to scuttle over at the heels of the last
elves before the great gates of the king closed behind them with a clang
Inside the passages were lit with red torchlight and the elfguards sang as
they marched along the twisting crossing and echoing paths These were not
like those of the goblincities they were smaller less deep underground and
filled with a cleaner air In a great hall with pillars hewn out of the living stone
sat the Elvenking on a chair of carven wood On his head was a crown of berries
and red leaves for the autumn was come again In the spring he wore a crown of
woodland flowers In his hand he held a carven staff of oak
