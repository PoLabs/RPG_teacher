On they went Gollum flipflapping ahead hissing and cursing Bilbo behind
going as softly as a hobbit can Soon they came to places where as Bilbo had
noticed on the way down sidepassages opened this way and that Gollum
began at once to count them
One left yes One right yes Two right yes yes Two left yes yes And so
on and on
As the count grew he slowed down and he began to get shaky and weepy for
he was leaving the water further and further behind and he was getting afraid
Goblins might be about and he had lost his ring At last he stopped by a low
opening on their left as they went up
Seven right yes Six left yes he whispered This is it This is the way to
the backdoor yes Heres the passage
He peered in and shrank back But we dursnt go in precious no we
dursnt Goblinses down there Lots of goblinses We smells them Ssss
What shall we do Curse them and crush them We must wait here
precious wait a bit and see
So they came to a dead stop Gollum had brought Bilbo to the way out after
all but Bilbo could not get in There was Gollum sitting humped up right in the
opening and his eyes gleamed cold in his head as he swayed it from side to side
between his knees
Bilbo crept away from the wall more quietly than a mouse but Gollum
stiffened at once and sniffed and his eyes went green He hissed softly but
menacingly He could not see the hobbit but now he was on the alert and he had
other senses that the darkness had sharpened hearing and smell He seemed to
be crouched right down with his flat hands splayed on the floor and his head
thrust out nose almost to the stone Though he was only a black shadow in the
gleam of his own eyes Bilbo could see or feel that he was tense as a bowstring
gathered for a spring
Bilbo almost stopped breathing and went stiff himself He was desperate He
must get away out of this horrible darkness while he had any strength left He
must fight He must stab the foul thing put its eyes out kill it It meant to kill
him No not a fair fight He was invisible now Gollum had no sword Gollum
had not actually threatened to kill him or tried to yet And he was miserable
alone lost A sudden understanding a pity mixed with horror welled up in
Bilbos heart a glimpse of endless unmarked days without light or hope of
betterment hard stone cold fish sneaking and whispering All these thoughts
passed in a flash of a second He trembled And then quite suddenly in another
