Tom got the branch in his teeth for that and lost one of the front ones It
made him howl I can tell you But just at that moment William came up behind
and popped a sack right over Thorins head and down to his toes And so the
fight ended A nice pickle they were all in now all neatly tied up in sacks with
three angry trolls and two with burns and bashes to remember sitting by them
arguing whether they should roast them slowly or mince them fine and boil
them or just sit on them one by one and squash them into jelly and Bilbo up in
a bush with his clothes and his skin torn not daring to move for fear they should
hear him
It was just then that Gandalf came back But no one saw him The trolls had just
decided to roast the dwarves now and eat them laterthat was Berts idea and
after a lot of argument they had all agreed to it
No good roasting em now itd take all night said a voice Bert thought it
was Williams
Dont start the argument all over again Bill he said or it will take all
night
Whos aarguing said William who thought it was Bert that had spoken
You are said Bert
Youre a liar said William and so the argument began all over again In
the end they decided to mince them fine and boil them So they got a great black
pot and they took out their knives
No good boiling em We aint got no water and its a long way to the well
and all said a voice Bert and William thought it was Toms
Shut up said they or well never have done And yer can fetch the water
yerself if yer say any more
Shut up yerself said Tom who thought it was Williams voice Whos
arguing but you Id like to know
Youre a booby said William
Booby yerself said Tom
And so the argument began all over again and went on hotter than ever until
at last they decided to sit on the sacks one by one and squash them and boil
them next time
Who shall we sit on first said the voice
Better sit on the last fellow first said Bert whose eye had been damaged
by Thorin He thought Tom was talking
