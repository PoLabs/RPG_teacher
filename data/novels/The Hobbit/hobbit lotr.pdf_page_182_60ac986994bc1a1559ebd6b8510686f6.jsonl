After he had seen that Mr Baggins one idea was to get away Well I really
must not detain Your Magnificence any longer he said or keep you from
much needed rest Ponies take some catching I believe after a long start And so
do burglars he added as a parting shot as he darted back and fled up the tunnel
It was an unfortunate remark for the dragon spouted terrific flames after him
and fast though he sped up the slope he had not gone nearly far enough to be
comfortable before the ghastly head of Smaug was thrust against the opening
behind Luckily the whole head and jaws could not squeeze in but the nostrils
sent forth fire and vapour to pursue him and he was nearly overcome and
stumbled blindly on in great pain and fear He had been feeling rather pleased
with the cleverness of his conversation with Smaug but his mistake at the end
shook him into better sense
Never laugh at live dragons Bilbo you fool he said to himself and it
became a favourite saying of his later and passed into a proverb You arent
nearly through this adventure yet he added and that was pretty true as well
The afternoon was turning into evening when he came out again and stumbled
and fell in a faint on the doorstep The dwarves revived him and doctored his
scorches as well as they could but it was a long time before the hair on the back
of his head and his heels grew properly again it had all been singed and frizzled
right down to the skin In the meanwhile his friends did their best to cheer him
up and they were eager for his story especially wanting to know why the dragon
had made such an awful noise and how Bilbo had escaped
But the hobbit was worried and uncomfortable and they had difficulty in
getting anything out of him On thinking things over he was now regretting some
of the things he had said to the dragon and was not eager to repeat them The
old thrush was sitting on a rock near by with his head cocked on one side
listening to all that was said It shows what an ill temper Bilbo was in he picked
up a stone and threw it at the thrush which merely fluttered aside and came
back
Drat the bird said Bilbo crossly I believe he is listening and I dont like
the look of him
Leave him alone said Thorin The thrushes are good and friendlythis is
a very old bird indeed and is maybe the last left of the ancient breed that used to
live about here tame to the hands of my father and grandfather They were a
longlived and magical race and this might even be one of those that were alive
