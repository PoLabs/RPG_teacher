Its eastern opening had also always been far to the south of the Lonely
Mountain and would have left them still with a long and difficult northward
march when they got to the other side North of the Carrock the edge of
Mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the Great River and though here the
Mountains too drew down nearer Beorn advised them to take this way for at a
place a few days ride due north of the Carrock was the gate of a littleknown
pathway through Mirkwood that led almost straight towards the Lonely
Mountain
The goblins Beorn had said will not dare to cross the Great River for a
hundred miles north of the Carrock nor to come near my houseit is well

Still the next morning dawned bright and fair again There was an autumn
like mist white upon the ground and the air was chill but soon the sun rose red
in the East and the mists vanished and while the shadows were still long they
were off again So they rode now for two more days and all the while they saw
nothing save grass and flowers and birds and scattered trees and occasionally
small herds of red deer browsing or sitting at noon in the shade Sometimes
Bilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking up out of the long grass and at first he
thought they were the dead branches of trees That third evening they were so
eager to press on for Beorn had said that they should reach the forestgate early
on the fourthday that they rode still forward after dusk and into the night
beneath the moon As the light faded Bilbo thought he saw away to the right or
