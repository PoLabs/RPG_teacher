For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought and light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword
On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars on crowns they hung
The dragonfire in twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun
Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To claim our longforgotten gold
Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold where no man delves
There lay they long and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves
The pines were roaring on the height
The winds were moaning in the night
The fire was red it flaming spread
The trees like torches blazed with light
The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale
The dragons ire more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail
The mountain smoked beneath the moon
The dwarves they heard the tramp of doom
They fled their hall to dying fall
