were with him and down they came like huge black shadows The wolves
yammered and gnashed their teeth the goblins yelled and stamped with rage
and flung their heavy spears in the air in vain Over them swooped the eagles
the dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far
away their talons tore at goblin faces Other birds flew to the treetops and
seized the dwarves who were scrambling up now as far as they ever dared to go
Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again He just managed to catch
hold of Doris legs as Dori was borne off last of all and up they went together
above the tumult and the burning Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly
breaking
Now far below the goblins and the wolves were scattering far and wide in the
woods A few eagles were still circling and sweeping above the battleground
The flames about the trees sprang suddenly up above the highest branches They
went up in crackling fire There was a sudden flurry of sparks and smoke Bilbo
had escaped only just in time
Soon the light of the burning was faint below a red twinkle on the black

The pale peaks of the mountains were coming nearer moonlit spikes of rock
sticking out of black shadows Summer or not it seemed very cold He shut his
eyes and wondered if he could hold on any longer Then he imagined what
would happen if he did not He felt sick
The flight ended only just in time for him just before his arms gave way He
loosed Doris ankles with a gasp and fell onto the rough platform of an eagles
eyrie There he lay without speaking and his thoughts were a mixture of surprise
at being saved from the fire and fear lest he fall off that narrow place into the
deep shadows on either side He was feeling very queer indeed in his head by
this time after the dreadful adventures of the last three days with next to nothing
