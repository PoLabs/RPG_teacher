kicking
Ill soon put an end to that hissed the angry spider climbing back onto the
branch
Bilbo saw that the moment had come when he must do something He could not
get up at the brutes and he had nothing to shoot with but looking about he saw
that in this place there were many stones lying in what appeared to be a now dry
little watercourse Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone and it did not take
him long to find a nice smooth eggshaped one that fitted his hand cosily As a
boy he used to practise throwing stones at things until rabbits and squirrels and
even birds got out of his way as quick as lightning if they saw him stoop and
even grownup he had still spent a deal of his time at quoits dartthrowing
shooting at the wand bowls ninepins and other quiet games of the aiming and
throwing sortindeed he could do lots of things besides blowing smokerings
asking riddles and cooking that I havent had time to tell you about There is no
time now While he was picking up stones the spider had reached Bombur and
soon he would have been dead At that moment Bilbo threw The stone struck
the spider plunk on the head and it dropped senseless off the tree flop to the
ground with all its legs curled up
The next stone went whizzing through a big web snapping its cords and
taking off the spider sitting in the middle of it whack dead After that there was
a deal of commotion in the spidercolony and they forgot the dwarves for a bit I
can tell you They could not see Bilbo but they could make a good guess at the
direction from which the stones were coming As quick as lightning they came
running and swinging towards the hobbit flinging out their long threads in all
directions till the air seemed full of waving snares
Bilbo however soon slipped away to a different place The idea came to him
to lead the furious spiders further and further away from the dwarves if he
could to make them curious excited and angry all at once When about fifty had
gone off to the place where he had stood before he threw some more stones at
these and at others that had stopped behind then dancing among the trees he
began to sing a song to infuriate them and bring them all after him and also to
let the dwarves hear his voice
This is what he sang
