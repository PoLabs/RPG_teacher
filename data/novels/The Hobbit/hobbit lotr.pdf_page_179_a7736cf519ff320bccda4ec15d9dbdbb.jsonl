You may indeed I come from under the hill and under the hills and over the
hills my paths led And through the air I am he that walks unseen
So I can well believe said Smaug but that is hardly your usual name
I am the cluefinder the webcutter the stinging fly I was chosen for the
lucky number
Lovely titles sneered the dragon But lucky numbers dont always come

I am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them alive
again from the water I came from the end of a bag but no bag went over me
These dont sound so creditable scoffed Smaug
I am the friend of bears and the guest of eagles I am Ringwinner and

than you can help
Dwarves said Bilbo in pretended surprise
Dont talk to me said Smaug I know the smell and taste of dwarfno

Youll come to a bad end if you go with such friends Thief Barrelrider I dont
