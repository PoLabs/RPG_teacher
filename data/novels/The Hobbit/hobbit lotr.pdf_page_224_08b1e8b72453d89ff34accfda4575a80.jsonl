Suddenly there was a great shout and from the Gate came a trumpet call
They had forgotten Thorin Part of the wall moved by levers fell outward with
a crash into the pool Out leapt the King under the Mountain and his
companions followed him Hood and cloak were gone they were in shining
armour and red light leapt from their eyes In the gloom the great dwarf gleamed
like gold in a dying fire
Rocks were hurled down from on high by the goblins above but they held
on leapt down to the falls foot and rushed forward to battle Wolf and rider fell
or fled before them Thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes and nothing
seemed to harm him
To me To me Elves and Men To me O my kinsfolk he cried and his
voice shook like a horn in the valley
Down heedless of order rushed all the dwarves of Dain to his help Down
too came many of the Lakemen for Bard could not restrain them and out upon
the other side came many of the spearmen of the elves Once again the goblins
were stricken in the valley and they were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and
hideous with their corpses The Wargs were scattered and Thorin drove right
against the bodyguard of Bolg But he could not pierce their ranks
Already behind him among the goblin dead lay many men and many
dwarves and many a fair elf that should have lived yet long ages merrily in the
wood And as the valley widened his onset grew ever slower His numbers were
too few His flanks were unguarded Soon the attackers were attacked and they
were forced into a great ring facing every way hemmed all about with goblins
and wolves returning to the assault The bodyguard of Bolg came howling
against them and drove in upon their ranks like waves upon cliffs of sand Their
friends could not help them for the assault from the Mountain was renewed with
redoubled force and upon either side men and elves were being slowly beaten
down
On all this Bilbo looked with misery He had taken his stand on Ravenhill
among the Elvespartly because there was more chance of escape from that
point and partly with the more Tookish part of his mind because if he was
going to be in a last desperate stand he preferred on the whole to defend the
Elvenking Gandalf too I may say was there sitting on the ground as if in deep
thought preparing I suppose some last blast of magic before the end
That did not seem far off It will not be long now thought Bilbo before
the goblins win the Gate and we are all slaughtered or driven down and
captured Really it is enough to make one weep after all one has gone through I
