the valleys head and climb slowly up Before long they could see that both men
of the lake armed as if for war and elvish bowmen were among them At length
the foremost of these climbed the tumbled rocks and appeared at the top of the
falls and very great was their surprise to see the pool before them and the Gate
blocked with a wall of newhewn stone
As they stood pointing and speaking to one another Thorin hailed them
Who are you he called in a very loud voice that come as if in war to the
gates of Thorin son of Thrain King under the Mountain and what do you
desire
But they answered nothing Some turned swiftly back and the others after
gazing for a while at the Gate and its defences soon followed them That day the
camp was moved to the east of the river right between the arms of the Mountain
The rocks echoed then with voices and with song as they had not done for many
a day There was the sound too of elvenharps and of sweet music and as it
echoed up towards them it seemed that the chill of the air was warmed and they
caught faintly the fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in spring
Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join
in the mirth and feasting by the fires Some of the younger dwarves were moved
in their hearts too and they muttered that they wished things had fallen out
otherwise and that they might welcome such folk as friends but Thorin scowled
Then the dwarves themselves brought forth harps and instruments regained
from the hoard and made music to soften his mood but their song was not as
elvish song and was much like the song they had sung long before in Bilbos
little hobbithole
Under the Mountain dark and tall
The King has come unto his hall
His foe is dead the Worm of Dread
And ever so his foes shall fall
The sword is sharp the spear is long
The arrow swift the Gate is strong
The heart is bold that looks on gold
The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong
