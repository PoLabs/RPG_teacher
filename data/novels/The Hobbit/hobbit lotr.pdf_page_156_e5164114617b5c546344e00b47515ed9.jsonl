pulled and soon the raft was drawn out of the current of the Forest River and
towed away round the high shoulder of rock into the little bay of Laketown
There it was moored not far from the shoreward head of the great bridge Soon
men would come up from the South and take some of the casks away and others
they would fill with goods they had brought to be taken back up the stream to the
Woodelves home In the meanwhile the barrels were left afloat while the elves
of the raft and the boatmen went to feast in Laketown
They would have been surprised if they could have seen what happened
down by the shore after they had gone and the shades of night had fallen First
of all a barrel was cut loose by Bilbo and pushed to the shore and opened
Groans came from inside and out crept a most unhappy dwarf Wet straw was in
his draggled beard he was so sore and stiff so bruised and buffeted he could
hardly stand or stumble through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore
He had a famished and a savage look like a dog that has been chained and
forgotten in a kennel for a week It was Thorin but you could only have told it
by his golden chain and by the colour of his now dirty and tattered skyblue
hood with its tarnished silver tassel It was some time before he would be even
polite to the hobbit
Well are you alive or are you dead asked Bilbo quite crossly Perhaps he
had forgotten that he had had at least one good meal more than the dwarves and
also the use of his arms and legs not to speak of a greater allowance of air Are
you still in prison or are you free If you want food and if you want to go on
with this silly adventureits yours after all and not mineyou had better slap
your arms and rub your legs and try and help me get the others out while there is
a chance
Thorin of course saw the sense of this so after a few more groans he got up
and helped the hobbit as well as he could In the darkness floundering in the cold
water they had a difficult and very nasty job finding which were the right barrels
Knocking outside and calling only discovered about six dwarves that could
answer These were unpacked and helped ashore where they sat or lay muttering
and moaning they were so soaked and bruised and cramped that they could
hardly yet realize their release or be properly thankful for it
Dwalin and Balin were two of the most unhappy and it was no good asking
them to help Bifur and Bofur were less knocked about and drier but they lay
down and would do nothing Fili and Kili however who were young for
dwarves and had also been packed more neatly with plenty of straw into smaller
casks came out more or less smiling with only a bruise or two and a stiffness
