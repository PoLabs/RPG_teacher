getting his wits back he thought of the answer Wind wind of course he said
and he was so pleased that he made up one on the spot Thisll puzzle the nasty
little underground creature he thought
An eye in a blue face
Saw an eye in a green face
That eye is like to this eye
Said the first eye
But in low place
Not in high place
Ss ss ss said Gollum He had been underground a long long time and was
forgetting this sort of thing But just as Bilbo was beginning to hope that the
wretch would not be able to answer Gollum brought up memories of ages and
ages and ages before when he lived with his grandmother in a hole in a bank by
a river Sss sss my preciouss he said Sun on the daisies it means it does
But these ordinary above ground everyday sort of riddles were tiring for him
Also they reminded him of days when he had been less lonely and sneaky and
nasty and that put him out of temper What is more they made him hungry so
this time he tried something a bit more difficult and more unpleasant
It cannot be seen cannot be felt
Cannot be heard cannot be smelt
It lies behind stars and under hills
    And empty holes it fills
It comes first and follows after
    Ends life kills laughter
Unfortunately for Gollum Bilbo had heard that sort of thing before and the
answer was all round him any way Dark he said without even scratching his
head or putting on his thinking cap
A box without hinges key or lid
Yet golden treasure inside is hid
