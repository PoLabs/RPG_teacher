But it wasnt a fair question said Gollum Not a riddle precious no
Oh well if its a matter of ordinary questions Bilbo replied then I asked
one first What have you lost Tell me that
What has it got in its pocketses The sound came hissing louder and
sharper and as he looked towards it to his alarm Bilbo now saw two small
points of light peering at him As suspicion grew in Gollums mind the light of
his eyes burned with a pale flame
What have you lost Bilbo persisted
But now the light in Gollums eyes had become a green fire and it was
coming swiftly nearer Gollum was in his boat again paddling wildly back to the
dark shore and such a rage of loss and suspicion was in his heart that no sword

his sword which was now glowing faintly again then very cautiously he
followed There seemed nothing else to do It was no good crawling back down
to Gollums water Perhaps if he followed him Gollum might lead him to some
way of escape without meaning to
Curse it curse it curse it hissed Gollum Curse the Baggins Its gone
What has it got in its pocketses Oh we guess we guess my precious Hes

Bilbo pricked up his ears He was at last beginning to guess himself He
