as well You must have heard the ugly names they were calling after us But the
ravens are different There used to be great friendship between them and the
people of Thror and they often brought us secret news and were rewarded with
such bright things as they coveted to hide in their dwellings
They live many a year and their memories are long and they hand on their
wisdom to their children I knew many among the ravens of the rocks when I
was a dwarflad This very height was once named Ravenhill because there was
a wise and famous pair old Carc and his wife that lived here above the guard
chamber But I dont suppose that any of that ancient breed linger here now
No sooner had he finished speaking than the old thrush gave a loud call and
immediately flew away
We may not understand him but that old bird understands us I am sure
said Balin Keep watch now and see what happens
Before long there was a fluttering of wings and back came the thrush and
with him came a most decrepit old bird He was getting blind he could hardly
fly and the top of his head was bald He was an aged raven of great size He
alighted stiffly on the ground before them slowly flapped his wings and bobbed
towards Thorin
O Thorin son of Thrain and Balin son of Fundin he croaked and Bilbo
could understand what he said for he used ordinary language and not bird
speech I am Roc son of Carc Carc is dead but he was well known to you
once It is a hundred years and three and fifty since I came out of the egg but I
do not forget what my father told me Now I am the chief of the great ravens of
the Mountain We are few but we remember still the king that was of old Most
of my people are abroad for there are great tidings in the Southsome are
tidings of joy to you and some you will not think so good
Behold the birds are gathering back again to the Mountain and to Dale from
South and East and West for word has gone out that Smaug is dead
Dead Dead shouted the dwarves Dead Then we have been in needless
fearand the treasure is ours They all sprang up and began to caper about for
joy
Yes dead said Roc The thrush may his feathers never fall saw him die
and we may trust his words He saw him fall in battle with the men of Esgaroth
the third night back from now at the rising of the moon
It was some time before Thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and
listen to the ravens news At length when he had told all the tale of the battle he
went on
