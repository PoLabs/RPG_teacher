including a jolly sturdy little white fellow that Elrond had lent to Gandalf since
his horse was not suitable for the mountainpaths For goblins eat horses and
ponies and donkeys and other much more dreadful things and they are always
hungry Just now however the prisoners were thinking only of themselves The
goblins chained their hands behind their backs and linked them all together in a
line and dragged them to the far end of the cavern with little Bilbo tugging at
the end of the row
There in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a
huge head and armed goblins were standing round him carrying the axes and the
bent swords that they use Now goblins are cruel wicked and badhearted They
make no beautiful things but they make many clever ones They can tunnel and
mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves when they take the trouble
though they are usually untidy and dirty Hammers axes swords daggers
pickaxes tongs and also instruments of torture they make very well or get
other people to make to their design prisoners and slaves that have to work till
they die for want of air and light It is not unlikely that they invented some of the
machines that have since troubled the world especially the ingenious devices for
killing large numbers of people at once for wheels and engines and explosions
always delighted them and also not working with their own hands more than
they could help but in those days and those wild parts they had not advanced as
it is called so far They did not hate dwarves especially no more than they hated
everybody and everything and particularly the orderly and prosperous in some
parts wicked dwarves had even made alliances with them But they had a special
grudge against Thorins people because of the war which you have heard
mentioned but which does not come into this tale and anyway goblins dont
care who they catch as long as it is done smart and secret and the prisoners are
not able to defend themselves
Who are these miserable persons said the Great Goblin
Dwarves and this said one of the drivers pulling at Bilbos chain so that
he fell forward onto his knees We found them sheltering in our Front Porch
What do you mean by it said the Great Goblin turning to Thorin Up to
no good Ill warrant Spying on the private business of my people I guess
Thieves I shouldnt be surprised to learn Murderers and friends of Elves not
unlikely Come What have you got to say
Thorin the dwarf at your service he repliedit was merely a polite
nothing Of the things which you suspect and imagine we had no idea at all We
sheltered from a storm in what seemed a convenient cave and unused nothing
