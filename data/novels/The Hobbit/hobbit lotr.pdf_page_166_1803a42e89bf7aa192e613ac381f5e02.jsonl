The dragon is still alive and in the halls under the Mountain thenor I
imagine so from the smoke said the hobbit
That does not prove it said Balin though I dont doubt you are right But
he might be gone away some time or he might be lying out on the mountainside
keeping watch and still I expect smokes and steams would come out of the
gates all the halls within must be filled with his foul reek
With such gloomy thoughts followed ever by croaking crows above them they
made their weary way back to the camp Only in June they had been guests in
the fair house of Elrond and though autumn was now crawling towards winter
that pleasant time now seemed years ago They were alone in the perilous waste
without hope of further help They were at the end of their journey but as far as
ever it seemed from the end of their quest None of them had much spirit left
Now strange to say Mr Baggins had more than the others He would often
borrow Thorins map and gaze at it pondering over the runes and the message of
the moonletters Elrond had read It was he that made the dwarves begin the
dangerous search on the western slopes for the secret door They moved their
camp then to a long valley narrower than the great dale in the South where the
Gates of the river stood and walled with lower spurs of the Mountain Two of
these here thrust forward west from the main mass in long steepsided ridges that
fell ever downwards towards the plain On this western side there were fewer
signs of the dragons marauding feet and there was some grass for their ponies
From this western camp shadowed all day by cliff and wall until the sun began
to sink towards the forest day by day they toiled in parties searching for paths
up the mountainside If the map was true somewhere high above the cliff at the
valleys head must stand the secret door Day by day they came back to their
camp without success
But at last unexpectedly they found what they were seeking Fili and Kili and
the hobbit went back one day down the valley and scrambled among the tumbled
rocks at its southern corner About midday creeping behind a great stone that
stood alone like a pillar Bilbo came on what looked like rough steps going
upwards Following these excitedly he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow
track often lost often rediscovered that wandered on to the top of the southern
ridge and brought them at last to a still narrower ledge which turned north
across the face of the Mountain Looking down they saw that they were at the
top of the cliff at the valleys head and were gazing down on to their own camp
