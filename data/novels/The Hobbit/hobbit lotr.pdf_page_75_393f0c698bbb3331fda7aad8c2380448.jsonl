flash as if lifted by a new strength and resolve he leaped
No great leap for a man but a leap in the dark Straight over Gollums head
he jumped seven feet forward and three in the air indeed had he known it he
only just missed cracking his skull on the low arch of the passage
Gollum threw himself backwards and grabbed as the hobbit flew over him
but too late his hands snapped on thin air and Bilbo falling fair on his sturdy
feet sped off down the new tunnel He did not turn to see what Gollum was
doing There was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at first then it
stopped All at once there came a bloodcurdling shriek filled with hatred and
despair Gollum was defeated He dared go no further He had lost lost his prey
and lost too the only thing he had ever cared for his precious The cry brought
Bilbos heart to his mouth but still he held on Now faint as an echo but
menacing the voice came behind
Thief thief thief Baggins We hates it we hates it we hates it for ever
Then there was a silence But that too seemed menacing to Bilbo If goblins
are so near that he smelt them he thought then theyll have heard his
shrieking and cursing Careful now or this way will lead you to worse things
The passage was low and roughly made It was not too difficult for the
hobbit except when in spite of all care he stubbed his poor toes again several
times on nasty jagged stones in the floor A bit low for goblins at least for the
big ones thought Bilbo not knowing that even the big ones the orcs of the
mountains go along at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the
ground
Soon the passage that had been sloping down began to go up again and after
a while it climbed steeply That slowed Bilbo down But at last the slope
stopped the passage turned a corner and dipped down again and there at the
bottom of a short incline he saw filtering round another cornera glimpse of
light Not red light as of fire or lantern but a pale outofdoors sort of light
Then Bilbo began to run
Scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him he turned the last corner and
came suddenly right into an open space where the light after all that time in the
dark seemed dazzlingly bright Really it was only a leak of sunshine in through
a doorway where a great door a stone door was left standing open
Bilbo blinked and then suddenly he saw the goblins goblins in full armour
with drawn swords sitting just inside the door and watching it with wide eyes
and watching the passage that led to it They were aroused alert ready for
anything
