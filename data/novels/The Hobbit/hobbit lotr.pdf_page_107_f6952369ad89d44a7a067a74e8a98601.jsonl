scuffling at the door Bilbo wondered what it was and whether it could be Beorn
in enchanted shape and if he would come in as a bear and kill them He dived
under the blankets and hid his head and fell asleep again at last in spite of his
fears
It was full morning when he awoke One of the dwarves had fallen over him in
the shadows where he lay and had rolled down with a bump from the platform
on to the floor It was Bofur and he was grumbling about it when Bilbo opened
his eyes
Get up lazybones he said or there will be no breakfast left for you
Up jumped Bilbo Breakfast he cried Where is breakfast
Mostly inside us answered the other dwarves who were moving about the
hall but what is left is out on the veranda We have been about looking for
Beorn ever since the sun got up but there is no sign of him anywhere though we
found breakfast laid as soon as we went out
Where is Gandalf asked Bilbo moving off to find something to eat as
quick as he could
O out and about somewhere they told him But he saw no sign of the
wizard all that day until the evening Just before sunset he walked into the hall
where the hobbit and the dwarves were having supper waited on by Beorns
wonderful animals as they had been all day Of Beorn they had seen and heard
nothing since the night before and they were getting puzzled
Where is our host and where have you been all day yourself they all
cried
One question at a timeand none till after supper I havent had a bite since
breakfast
At last Gandalf pushed away his plate and jughe had eaten two whole
loaves with masses of butter and honey and clotted cream and drunk at least a
quart of meadand he took out his pipe I will answer the second question
first he said but bless me this is a splendid place for smoke rings Indeed
for a long time they could get nothing more out of him he was so busy sending
smoke rings dodging round the pillars of the hall changing them into all sorts of
different shapes and colours and setting them at last chasing one another out of
the hole in the roof They must have looked very queer from outside popping
out into the air one after another green blue red silvergrey yellow white big
ones little ones little ones dodging through big ones and joining into figure
