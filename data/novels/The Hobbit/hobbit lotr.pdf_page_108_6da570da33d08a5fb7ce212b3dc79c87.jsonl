eights and going off like a flock of birds into the distance
I have been picking out beartracks he said at last There must have been
a regular bears meeting outside here last night I soon saw that Beorn could not
have made them all there were far too many of them and they were of various
sizes too I should say there were little bears large bears ordinary bears and
gigantic big bears all dancing outside from dark to nearly dawn They came
from almost every direction except from the west over the river from the
