the Mountain and beams of gold fell on the pavement at the threshold
A whirl of bats frightened from slumber by their smoking torches flurried
over them as they sprang forward their feet slithered on stones rubbed smooth
and slimed by the passing of the dragon Now before them the water fell noisily
outward and foamed down towards the valley They flung their pale torches to
the ground and stood gazing out with dazzled eyes They were come to the
Front Gate and were looking out upon Dale
Well said Bilbo I never expected to be looking out of this door And I
never expected to be so pleased to see the sun again and to feel the wind on my
face But ow this wind is cold
It was A bitter easterly breeze blew with a threat of oncoming winter It
swirled over and round the arms of the Mountain into the valley and sighed
among the rocks After their long time in the stewing depths of the dragon
haunted caverns they shivered in the sun
Suddenly Bilbo realized that he was not only tired but also very hungry
indeed It seems to be late morning he said and so I suppose it is more or
less breakfasttimeif there is any breakfast to have But I dont feel that
Smaugs front doorstep is the safest place for a meal Do lets go somewhere
where we can sit quiet for a bit
Quite right said Balin And I think I know which way we should go we
ought to make for the old lookout post at the SouthWest corner of the
Mountain
How far is that asked the hobbit
Five hours march I should think It will be rough going The road from the
Gate along the left edge of the stream seems all broken up But look down there
The river loops suddenly east across Dale in front of the ruined town At that
point there was once a bridge leading to steep stairs that climbed up the right
bank and so to a road running towards Ravenhill There is or was a path that
left the road and climbed up to the post A hard climb too even if the old steps
are still there
Dear me grumbled the hobbit More walking and more climbing without
breakfast I wonder how many breakfasts and other meals we have missed
inside that nasty clockless timeless hole
As a matter of fact two nights and the day between had gone by and not
altogether without food since the dragon smashed the magic door but Bilbo had
quite lost count and it might have been one night or a week of nights for all he
could tell
