then a couple of hundreds of years or more ago The Men of Dale used to have
the trick of understanding their language and used them for messengers to fly to
the Men of the Lake and elsewhere
Well hell have news to take to Laketown all right if that is what he is
after said Bilbo though I dont suppose there are any people left there that
trouble with thrushlanguage
Why what has happened cried the dwarves Do get on with your tale
So Bilbo told them all he could remember and he confessed that he had a
