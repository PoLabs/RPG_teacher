below Silently clinging to the rocky wall on their right they went in single file
along the ledge till the wall opened and they turned into a little steepwalled
bay grassyfloored still and quiet Its entrance which they had found could not
be seen from below because of the overhang of the cliff nor from further off
because it was so small that it looked like a dark crack and no more It was not a
cave and was open to the sky above but at its inner end a flat wall rose up that in
the lower part close to the ground was as smooth and upright as masons work
but without a joint or crevice to be seen No sign was there of post or lintel or
threshold nor any sign of bar or bolt or keyhole yet they did not doubt that
they had found the door at last
They beat on it they thrust and pushed at it they implored it to move they
spoke fragments of broken spells of opening and nothing stirred At last tired

down
There was excitement in the camp that night In the morning they prepared to
move once more Only Bofur and Bombur were left behind to guard the ponies
and such stores as they had brought with them from the river The others went
down the valley and up the newly found path and so to the narrow ledge Along
this they could carry no bundles or packs so narrow and breathless was it with a
fall of a hundred and fifty feet beside them on to sharp rocks below but each of
them took a good coil of rope wound tight about his waist and so at last without
mishap they reached the little grassy bay
There they made their third camp hauling up what they needed from below
with their ropes Down the same way they were able occasionally to lower one
of the more active dwarves such as Kili to exchange such news as there was or
to take a share in the guard below while Bofur was hauled up to the higher
camp Bombur would not come up either the rope or the path
I am too fat for such flywalks he said I should turn dizzy and tread on
my beard and then you would be thirteen again And the knotted ropes are too
slender for my weight Luckily for him that was not true as you will see
In the meanwhile some of them explored the ledge beyond the opening and
found a path that led higher and higher on to the mountain but they did not dare
