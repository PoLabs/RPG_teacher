swung themselves into lower branches some like the little hobbit got behind a
tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks Soon the danger was over the
slide had stopped and the last faint crashes could be heard as the largest of the
disturbed stones went bounding and spinning among the bracken and the pine
roots far below
Well that has got us on a bit said Gandalf and even goblins tracking us
will have a job to come down here quietly
I daresay grumbled Bombur but they wont find it difficult to send stones
bouncing down on our heads The dwarves and Bilbo were feeling far from
happy and were rubbing their bruised and damaged legs and feet
Nonsense We are going to turn aside here out of the path of the slide We
must be quick Look at the light
The sun had long gone behind the mountains Already the shadows were
deepening about them though far away through the trees and over the black tops
of those growing lower down they could still see the evening lights on the plains
beyond They limped along now as fast as they were able down the gentle slopes
of a pine forest in a slanting path leading steadily southwards At times they
were pushing through a sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the
hobbits head at times they were marching along quiet as quiet over a floor of
pineneedles and all the while the forestgloom got heavier and the forest
silence deeper There was no wind that evening to bring even a seasighing into
the branches of the trees
Must we go any further asked Bilbo when it was so dark that he could only
just see Thorins beard wagging beside him and so quiet that he could hear the
dwarves breathing like a loud noise My toes are all bruised and bent and my
legs ache and my stomach is wagging like an empty sack
A bit further said Gandalf
After what seemed ages further they came suddenly to an opening where no
trees grew The moon was up and was shining into the clearing Somehow it
struck all of them as not at all a nice place although there was nothing wrong to
see
All of a sudden they heard a howl away down hill a long shuddering howl It
was answered by another away to the right and a good deal nearer to them then
by another not far away to the left It was wolves howling at the moon wolves
gathering together
