away through the trees They followed the tracks up the hill until hidden by
bushes they came on a big door of stone leading to a cave But they could not
open it not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried various incantations
Would this be any good asked Bilbo when they were getting tired and
angry I found it on the ground where the trolls had their fight He held out a
largish key though no doubt William had thought it very small and secret It
must have fallen out of his pocket very luckily before he was turned to stone
Why on earth didnt you mention it before they cried Gandalf grabbed it
and fitted it into the keyhole Then the stone door swung back with one big push
and they all went inside There were bones on the floor and a nasty smell was in
the air but there was a good deal of food jumbled carelessly on shelves and on
the ground among an untidy litter of plunder of all sorts from brass buttons to
pots full of gold coins standing in a corner There were lots of clothes too
hanging on the wallstoo small for trolls I am afraid they belonged to victims
and among them were several swords of various makes shapes and sizes
Two caught their eyes particularly because of their beautiful scabbards and
jewelled hilts
Gandalf and Thorin each took one of these and Bilbo took a knife in a
leather sheath It would have made only a tiny pocketknife for a troll but it was
as good as a short sword for the hobbit
These look like good blades said the wizard half drawing them and
looking at them curiously They were not made by any troll nor by any smith
among men in these parts and days but when we can read the runes on them we
shall know more about them
Lets get out of this horrible smell said Fili So they carried out the pots of
coins and such food as was untouched and looked fit to eat also one barrel of
ale which was still full By that time they felt like breakfast and being very
hungry they did not turn their noses up at what they had got from the trolls
larder Their own provisions were very scanty Now they had bread and cheese
and plenty of ale and bacon to toast in the embers of the fire
After that they slept for their night had been disturbed and they did nothing
more till the afternoon Then they brought up their ponies and carried away the
pots of gold and buried them very secretly not far from the track by the river
putting a great many spells over them just in case they ever had the chance to
come back and recover them When that was done they all mounted once more
and jogged along again on the path towards the East
Where did you go to if I may ask said Thorin to Gandalf as they rode
