We are getting near said Gandalf We are on the edge of his bee
pastures
After a while they came to a belt of tall and very ancient oaks and beyond these
to a high thornhedge through which you could neither see nor scramble
You had better wait here said the wizard to the dwarves and when I call
or whistle begin to come after meyou will see the way I gobut only in pairs
mind about five minutes between each pair of you Bombur is fattest and will do
for two he had better come alone and last Come on Mr Baggins There is a
gate somewhere round this way And with that he went off along the hedge
taking the frightened hobbit with him
They soon came to a wooden gate high and broad beyond which they could
see gardens and a cluster of low wooden buildings some thatched and made of
unshaped logs barns stables sheds and a long low wooden house Inside on the
southward side of the great hedge were rows and rows of hives with bellshaped
tops made of straw The noise of the giant bees flying to and fro and crawling in
and out filled all the air
The wizard and the hobbit pushed open the heavy creaking gate and went
down a wide track towards the house Some horses very sleek and well
groomed trotted up across the grass and looked at them intently with very
intelligent faces then off they galloped to the buildings
They have gone to tell him of the arrival of strangers said Gandalf
Soon they reached a courtyard three walls of which were formed by the
wooden house and its two long wings In the middle there was lying a great oak
trunk with many lopped branches beside it Standing near was a huge man with a
thick black beard and hair and great bare arms and legs with knotted muscles
He was clothed in a tunic of wool down to his knees and was leaning on a large
axe The horses were standing by him with their noses at his shoulder
Ugh here they are he said to the horses They dont look dangerous You
can be off He laughed a great rolling laugh put down his axe and came
forward
Who are you and what do you want he asked gruffly standing in front of
them and towering tall above Gandalf As for Bilbo he could easily have trotted
through his legs without ducking his head to miss the fringe of the mans brown
tunic
I am Gandalf said the wizard
