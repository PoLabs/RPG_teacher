Chapter IX
BARRELS OUT OF BOND
The day after the battle with the spiders Bilbo and the dwarves made one last
despairing effort to find a way out before they died of hunger and thirst They
got up and staggered on in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of them
guessed to be the one in which the path lay but they never found out if they
were right Such day as there ever was in the forest was fading once more into
the blackness of night when suddenly out sprang the light of many torches all
round them like hundreds of red stars Out leaped Woodelves with their bows
and spears and called the dwarves to halt
There was no thought of a fight Even if the dwarves had not been in such a
state that they were actually glad to be captured their small knives the only
weapons they had would have been of no use against the arrows of the elves that
could hit a birds eye in the dark So they simply stopped dead and sat down and
waitedall except Bilbo who popped on his ring and slipped quickly to one
side That is why when the elves bound the dwarves in a long line one behind
the other and counted them they never found or counted the hobbit
Nor did they hear or feel him trotting along well behind their torchlight as
they led off their prisoners into the forest Each dwarf was blindfold but that did
not make much difference for even Bilbo with the use of his eyes could not see
where they were going and neither he nor the others knew where they had
started from anyway Bilbo had all he could do to keep up with the torches for
the elves were making the dwarves go as fast as ever they could sick and weary
as they were The king had ordered them to make haste Suddenly the torches
stopped and the hobbit had just time to catch them up before they began to cross
the bridge This was the bridge that led across the river to the kings doors The
water flowed dark and swift and strong beneath and at the far end were gates
