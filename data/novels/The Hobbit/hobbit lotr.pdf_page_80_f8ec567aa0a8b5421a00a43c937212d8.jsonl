the others He called to Balin and told him what he thought of a lookout man
who let people walk right into them like that without warning It is a fact that
Bilbos reputation went up a very great deal with the dwarves after this If they
had still doubted that he was really a firstclass burglar in spite of Gandalfs
words they doubted no longer Balin was the most puzzled of all but everyone
said it was a very clever bit of work
Indeed Bilbo was so pleased with their praise that he just chuckled inside and
said nothing whatever about the ring and when they asked him how he did it he
said Oh just crept along you knowvery carefully and quietly
Well it is the first time that even a mouse has crept along carefully and
quietly under my very nose and not been spotted said Balin and I take off my
hood to you Which he did
Balin at your service said he
Your servant Mr Baggins said Bilbo
Then they wanted to know all about his adventures after they had lost him
and he sat down and told them everythingexcept about the finding of the ring
not just now he thought They were particularly interested in the riddle
competition and shuddered most appreciatively at his description of Gollum
And then I couldnt think of any other question with him sitting beside me
ended Bilbo so I said whats in my pocket And he couldnt guess in three
goes So I said what about your promise Show me the way out But he came
at me to kill me and I ran and fell over and he missed me in the dark Then I
followed him because I heard him talking to himself He thought I really knew
the way out and so he was making for it And then he sat down in the entrance
and I could not get by So I jumped over him and escaped and ran down to the
gate
What about the guards they asked Werent there any
O yes lots of them but I dodged em I got stuck in the door which was
only open a crack and I lost lots of buttons he said sadly looking at his torn
clothes But I squeezed through all rightand here I am
The dwarves looked at him with quite a new respect when he talked about
dodging guards jumping over Gollum and squeezing through as if it was not
very difficult or very alarming
What did I tell you said Gandalf laughing Mr Baggins has more about
him than you guess He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy
eyebrows as he said this and the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of
his tale that he had left out
