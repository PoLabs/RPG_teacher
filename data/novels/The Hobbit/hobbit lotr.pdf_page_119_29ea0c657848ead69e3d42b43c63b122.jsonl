appeared Now he sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping beast As it reached
the further bank it stumbled The shadows swallowed it up but they heard the
sound of hooves quickly falter and then go still
Before they could shout in praise of the shot however a dreadful wail from
Bilbo put all thoughts of venison out of their minds Bombur has fallen in
Bombur is drowning he cried It was only too true Bombur had only one foot
on the land when the hart bore down on him and sprang over him He had
stumbled thrusting the boat away from the bank and then toppled back into the
