Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside I was one luckilya fine
adventurous lad in those days always wandering about and it saved my life that
daywell from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a
spout of flame Then he came down the slopes and when he reached the woods
they all went up in fire By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the
warriors were arming The dwarves rushed out of their great gate but there was
the dragon waiting for them None escaped that way The river rushed up in
steam and a fog fell on Dale and in the fog the dragon came on them and
destroyed most of the warriorsthe usual unhappy story it was only too
common in those days Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate
and routed out all the halls and lanes and tunnels alleys cellars mansions and
passages After that there were no dwarves left alive inside and he took all their
wealth for himself Probably for that is the dragons way he has piled it all up in
a great heap far inside and sleeps on it for a bed Later he used to crawl out of
the great gate and come by night to Dale and carry away people especially
maidens to eat until Dale was ruined and all the people dead or gone What
goes on there now I dont know for certain but I dont suppose any one lives
nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake nowadays
The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding and cursed
Smaug and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather
with singed beards They looked very grim but they said very little When I
asked how they had got away they told me to hold my tongue and said that one
day in the proper time I should know After that we went away and we have had
to earn our livings as best we could up and down the lands often enough sinking
as low as blacksmithwork or even coalmining But we have never forgotten our
stolen treasure And even now when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and
are not so badly offhere Thorin stroked the gold chain round his neckwe
still mean to get it back and to bring our curses home to Smaugif we can
I have often wondered about my fathers and my grandfathers escape I see
now they must have had a private Sidedoor which only they knew about But
apparently they made a map and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of
it and why it did not come down to me the rightful heir
I did not get hold of it I was given it said the wizard Your grandfather
Thror was killed you remember in the mines of Moria by Azog the Goblin
Curse his name yes said Thorin
And Thrain your father went away on the twentyfirst of April a hundred
years ago last Thursday and has never been seen by you since
