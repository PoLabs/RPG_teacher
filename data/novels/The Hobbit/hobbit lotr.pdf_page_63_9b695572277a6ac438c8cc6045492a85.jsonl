know how long he kept on like this hating to go on not daring to stop on on
until he was tireder than tired It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it
to the days beyond
Suddenly without any warning he trotted splash into water Ugh it was icy
cold That pulled him up sharp and short He did not know whether it was just a
pool in the path or the edge of an underground stream that crossed the passage
or the brink of a deep dark subterranean lake The sword was hardly shining at
all He stopped and he could hear when he listened hard drops dripdrip
dripping from an unseen roof into the water below but there seemed no other

So it is a pool or a lake and not an underground river he thought Still he

He liked meat too Goblin he thought good when he could get it but he took
care they never found him out He just throttled them from behind if they ever
came down alone anywhere near the edge of the water while he was prowling
about They very seldom did for they had a feeling that something unpleasant
was lurking down there down at the very roots of the mountain They had come
on the lake when they were tunnelling down long ago and they found they
could go no further so there their road ended in that direction and there was no
