run The river is running gold from the Mountain they cried and everywhere
windows were opening and feet were hurrying
There was once more a tremendous excitement and enthusiasm But the grim
voiced fellow ran hotfoot to the Master The dragon is coming or I am a fool
he cried Cut the bridges To arms To arms
Then warning trumpets were suddenly sounded and echoed along the rocky
