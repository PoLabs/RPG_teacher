that soon wore off
I hope I never smell the smell of apples again said Fili My tub was full
of it To smell apples everlastingly when you can scarcely move and are cold and
sick with hunger is maddening I could eat anything in the wide world now for
hours on endbut not an apple
With the willing help of Fili and Kili Thorin and Bilbo at last discovered the
remainder of the company and got them out Poor fat Bombur was asleep or
senseless Dori Nori Ori Oin and Gloin were waterlogged and seemed only
half alive they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless on the shore
Well Here we are said Thorin And I suppose we ought to thank our stars
and Mr Baggins I am sure he has a right to expect it though I wish he could
have arranged a more comfortable journey Stillall very much at your service
once more Mr Baggins No doubt we shall feel properly grateful when we are
fed and recovered In the meanwhile what next
I suggest Laketown said Bilbo What else is there
Nothing else could of course be suggested so leaving the others Thorin and
Fili and Kili and the hobbit went along the shore to the great bridge There were
guards at the head of it but they were not keeping very careful watch for it was
so long since there had been any real need Except for occasional squabbles
about rivertolls they were friends with the Woodelves Other folk were far
away and some of the younger people in the town openly doubted the existence
of any dragon in the mountain and laughed at the greybeards and gammers who
said that they had seen him flying in the sky in their young days That being so it
is not surprising that the guards were drinking and laughing by a fire in their hut
and did not hear the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the
four scouts Their astonishment was enormous when Thorin Oakenshield
stepped in through the door
Who are you and what do you want they shouted leaping to their feet and
groping for weapons
Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King under the Mountain said the dwarf
in a loud voice and he looked it in spite of his torn clothes and draggled hood
The gold gleamed on his neck and waist his eyes were dark and deep I have
come back I wish to see the Master of your town
Then there was tremendous excitement Some of the more foolish ran out of
the hut as if they expected the Mountain to go golden in the night and all the
waters of the lake turn yellow right away The captain of the guard came
forward
