guard had no keys but Bilbo was trotting as fast as he could along the passages
towards the cells The great bunch seemed very heavy to his arms and his heart
was often in his mouth in spite of his ring for he could not prevent the keys
from making every now and then a loud clink and clank which put him all in a
tremble
First he unlocked Balins door and locked it again carefully as soon as the
dwarf was outside Balin was most surprised as you can imagine but glad as he
was to get out of his wearisome little stone room he wanted to stop and ask
questions and know what Bilbo was going to do and all about it
No time now said the hobbit You just follow me We must all keep
together and not risk getting separated All of us must escape or none and this is
our last chance If this is found out goodness knows where the king will put you
next with chains on your hands and feet too I expect Dont argue theres a
good fellow
Then off he went from door to door until his following had grown to twelve
none of them any too nimble what with the dark and what with their long
imprisonment Bilbos heart thumped every time one of them bumped into
another or grunted or whispered in the dark Drat this dwarvish racket he said
to himself But all went well and they met no guards As a matter of fact there
was a great autumn feast in the woods that night and in the halls above Nearly
all the kings folk were merrymaking
At last after much blundering they came to Thorins dungeon far down in a
deep place and fortunately not far from the cellars
Upon my word said Thorin when Bilbo whispered to him to come out and
join his friends Gandalf spoke true as usual A pretty fine burglar you make it
seems when the time comes I am sure we are all for ever at your service
whatever happens after this But what comes next
Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea as far as he could but
he did not feel at all sure how the dwarves would take it His fears were quite
justified for they did not like it a bit and started grumbling loudly in spite of
their danger
We shall be bruised and battered to pieces and drowned too for certain
they muttered We thought you had got some sensible notion when you
managed to get hold of the keys This is a mad idea
Very well said Bilbo very downcast and also rather annoyed Come
along back to your nice cells and I will lock you all in again and you can sit
there comfortably and think of a better planbut I dont suppose I shall ever get
