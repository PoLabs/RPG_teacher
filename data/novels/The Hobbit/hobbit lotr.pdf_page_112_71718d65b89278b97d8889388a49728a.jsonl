to the left the shadowy form of a great bear prowling along in the same
direction But if he dared to mention it to Gandalf the wizard only said Hush
Take no notice
Next day they started before dawn though their night had been short As
soon as it was light they could see the forest coming as it were to meet them or
waiting for them like a black and frowning wall before them The land began to
slope up and up and it seemed to the hobbit that a silence began to draw in upon
them Birds began to sing less There were no more deer not even rabbits were
to be seen By the afternoon they had reached the eaves of Mirkwood and were
resting almost beneath the great overhanging boughs of its outer trees Their
trunks were huge and gnarled their branches twisted their leaves were dark and
long Ivy grew on them and trailed along the ground
Well here is Mirkwood said Gandalf The greatest of the forests of the
Northern world I hope you like the look of it Now you must send back these
excellent ponies you have borrowed
The dwarves were inclined to grumble at this but the wizard told them they

What about your promise then
I will look after that I am not sending the horse back I am riding it
Then they knew that Gandalf was going to leave them at the very edge of
Mirkwood and they were in despair But nothing they could say would change
his mind
Now we had this all out before when we landed on the Carrock he said
It is no use arguing I have as I told you some pressing business away south
and I am already late through bothering with you people We may meet again
before all is over and then again of course we may not That depends on your
luck and on your courage and sense and I am sending Mr Baggins with you I
