mind if you go back and tell them so from me But he did not tell Bilbo that
there was one smell he could not make out at all hobbitsmell it was quite
outside his experience and puzzled him mightily
I suppose you got a fair price for that cup last night he went on Come
now did you Nothing at all Well thats just like them And I suppose they are
skulking outside and your job is to do all the dangerous work and get what you
can when Im not lookingfor them And you will get a fair share Dont you
believe it If you get off alive you will be lucky
Bilbo was now beginning to feel really uncomfortable Whenever Smaugs
roving eye seeking for him in the shadows flashed across him he trembled and
an unaccountable desire seized hold of him to rush out and reveal himself and
tell all the truth to Smaug In fact he was in grievous danger of coming under the
dragonspell But plucking up courage he spoke again
You dont know everything O Smaug the Mighty said he Not gold alone
brought us hither
Ha Ha You admit the us laughed Smaug Why not say us fourteen
and be done with it Mr Lucky Number I am pleased to hear that you had other
business in these parts besides my gold In that case you may perhaps not
altogether waste your time
I dont know if it has occurred to you that even if you could steal the gold
bit by bita matter of a hundred years or soyou could not get it very far Not
much use on the mountainside Not much use in the forest Bless me Had you
never thought of the catch A fourteenth share I suppose or something like it
those were the terms eh But what about delivery What about cartage What
about armed guards and tolls And Smaug laughed aloud He had a wicked and
a wily heart and he knew his guesses were not far out though he suspected that
the Lakemen were at the back of the plans and that most of the plunder was
meant to stop there in the town by the shore that in his young days had been
called Esgaroth
You will hardly believe it but poor Bilbo was really very taken aback So far
all his thoughts and energies had been concentrated on getting to the Mountain
and finding the entrance He had never bothered to wonder how the treasure was
to be removed certainly never how any part of it that might fall to his share was
to be brought back all the way to BagEnd UnderHill
Now a nasty suspicion began to grow in his mindhad the dwarves forgotten
