the once proud George Darling as he sat in the kennel of an evening
talking with his wife of their children and all their pretty ways
Very touching was his deference to Nana He would not let her
come into the kennel but on all other matters he followed her wishes
implicitly
Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr Darling in it to a
cab which conveyed him to his office and he returned home in the
same way at six Something of the strength of character of the man
will be seen if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of
neighbours this man whose every movement now attracted surprised
attention Inwardly he must have suffered torture but he preserved a
calm exterior even when the young criticised his little home and he
always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked inside
It may have been Quixotic but it was magnificent Soon the
inward meaning of it leaked out and the great heart of the public was
touched Crowds followed the cab cheering it lustily charming girls
scaled it to get his autograph interviews appeared in the better class
of papers and society invited him to dinner and added Do come in
the kennel
On that eventful Thursday week Mrs Darling was in the night
nursery awaiting Georges return home a very sadeyed woman
Now that we look at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in
the old days all gone now just because she has lost her babes I find
I wont be able to say nasty things about her after all If she was too
fond of her rubbishy children she couldnt help it Look at her in her
chair where she has fallen asleep The corner of her mouth where
one looks first is almost withered up Her hand moves restlessly on
her breast as if she had a pain there Some like Peter best and some
like Wendy best but I like her best Suppose to make her happy we
whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back They are
really within two miles of the window now and flying strong but all
we need whisper is that they are on the way Lets
It is a pity we did it for she has started up calling their names
and there is no one in the room but Nana
O Nana I dreamt my dear ones had come back
Nana had filmy eyes but all she could do was put her paw gently
on her mistresss lap and they were sitting together thus when the
kennel was brought back As Mr Darling puts his head out to kiss his
wife we see that his face is more worn than of yore but has a softer
expression
He gave his hat to Liza who took it scornfully for she had no
imagination and was quite incapable of understanding the motives
of such a man Outside the crowd who had accompanied the cab
home were still cheering and he was naturally not unmoved
Listen to them he said it is very gratifying
Lots of little boys sneered Liza
There were several adults today he assured her with a faint
flush but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for
her Social success had not spoilt him it had made him sweeter For
some time he sat with his head out of the kennel talking with Mrs
Darling of this success and pressing her hand reassuringly when she
said she hoped his head would not be turned by it
