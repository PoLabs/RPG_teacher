when we have need of special attention we nobly return for it
confident that we shall be rewarded instead of smacked
So great indeed was their faith in a mothers love that they felt
they could afford to be callous for a bit longer
But there was one there who knew better and when Wendy
finished he uttered a hollow groan
What is it Peter she cried running to him thinking he was ill
She felt him solicitously lower down than his chest Where is it
Peter
It isnt that kind of pain Peter replied darkly
Then what kind is it
Wendy you are wrong about mothers
They all gathered round him in affright so alarming was his
agitation and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto
concealed
Long ago he said I thought like you that my mother would
always keep the window open for me so I stayed away for moons
and moons and moons and then flew back but the window was
barred for mother had forgotten all about me and there was another
little boy sleeping in my bed
I am not sure that this was true but Peter thought it was true and
it scared them
Are you sure mothers are like that
Yes
So this was the truth about mothers The toads
Still it is best to be careful and no one knows so quickly as a child
when he should give in Wendy let us go home cried John and
Michael together
Yes she said clutching them
Not tonight asked the lost boys bewildered They knew in
what they called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a
mother and that it is only the mothers who think you cant
At once Wendy replied resolutely for the horrible thought had
come to her Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time
This dread made her forgetful of what must be Peters feelings
and she said to him rather sharply Peter will you make the
necessary arrangements
If you wish it he replied as coolly as if she had asked him to
pass the nuts
Not so much as a sorrytoloseyou between them If she did not
mind the parting he was going to show her was Peter that neither
did he
But of course he cared very much and he was so full of wrath
against grownups who as usual were spoiling everything that as
soon as he got inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short
breaths at the rate of about five to a second He did this because there
is a saying in the Neverland that every time you breathe a grownup
dies and Peter was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible
