jealousy of Wendy What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could
not of course understand and I believe some of it was bad words but
it sounded kind and she flew back and forward plainly meaning
Follow me and all will be well
What else could poor Wendy do She called to Peter and John and
Michael and got only mocking echoes in reply She did not yet know
that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman And so
bewildered and now staggering in her flight she followed Tink to
her doom
