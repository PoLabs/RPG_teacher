What was that
But they could see nothing They thought it must have been a leaf
in the wind Do you agree my bullies asked Hook
There is my hand on it they both said
And there is my hook Swear
They all swore By this time they were on the rock and suddenly
Hook remembered Tiger Lily
Where is the redskin he demanded abruptly
He had a playful humour at moments and they thought this was
one of the moments
That is all right captain Smee answered complacently we let
her go
Let her go cried Hook
Twas your own orders the bosun faltered
You called over the water to us to let her go said Starkey
Brimstone and gall thundered Hook what cozening is going
on here His face had gone black with rage but he saw that they
believed their words and he was startled Lads he said shaking a
little I gave no such order
It is passing queer Smee said and they all fidgeted
uncomfortably Hook raised his voice but there was a quiver in it
Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon tonight he cried dost hear
me
Of course Peter should have kept quiet but of course he did not
He immediately answered in Hooks voice
Odds bobs hammer and tongs I hear you
In that supreme moment Hook did not blanch even at the gills but
Smee and Starkey clung to each other in terror
Who are you stranger Speak Hook demanded
I am James Hook replied the voice captain of the Jolly
Roger
You are not you are not Hook cried hoarsely
Brimstone and gall the voice retorted say that again and Ill
cast anchor in you
Hook tried a more ingratiating manner If you are Hook he said
almost humbly come tell me who am I
A codfish replied the voice only a codfish
A codfish Hook echoed blankly and it was then but not till
then that his proud spirit broke He saw his men draw back from
him
Have we been captained all this time by a codfish they
muttered It is lowering to our pride
They were his dogs snapping at him but tragic figure though he
had become he scarcely heeded them Against such fearful evidence
it was not their belief in him that he needed it was his own He felt
his ego slipping from him Dont desert me bully he whispered
hoarsely to it
