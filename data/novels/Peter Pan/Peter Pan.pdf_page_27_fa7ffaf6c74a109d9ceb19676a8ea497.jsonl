How do you mean
I cut off a bit of him
You
Yes me said Peter sharply
I wasnt meaning to be disrespectful
Oh all right
But I say what bit
His right hand
Then he cant fight now
Oh cant he just
Lefthander
He has an iron hook instead of a right hand and he claws with
it
Claws
I say John said Peter
Yes
Say Ay ay sir
Ay ay sir
There is one thing Peter continued that every boy who serves
under me has to promise and so must you
John paled
It is this if we meet Hook in open fight you must leave him to
me
I promise John said loyally
For the moment they were feeling less eerie because Tink was
flying with them and in her light they could distinguish each other
Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they and so she had to
go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a
halo Wendy quite liked it until Peter pointed out the drawbacks
She tells me he said that the pirates sighted us before the
darkness came and got Long Tom out
The big gun
Yes And of course they must see her light and if they guess we
are near it they are sure to let fly
Wendy
John
Michael
Tell her to go away at once Peter the three cried
simultaneously but he refused
She thinks we have lost the way he replied stiffly and she is
rather frightened You dont think I would send her away all by
herself when she is frightened
For a moment the circle of light was broken and something gave
Peter a loving little pinch
Then tell her Wendy begged to put out her light
She cant put it out That is about the only thing fairies cant do
It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep same as the stars
