that he should get at the honey It was Pan he wanted Pan and
Wendy and their band but chiefly Pan
Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the mans
hatred of him True he had flung Hooks arm to the crocodile but
even this and the increased insecurity of life to which it led owing to
the crocodiles pertinacity hardly account for a vindictiveness so
relentless and malignant The truth is that there was a something
about Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy It was not his
courage it was not his engaging appearance it was not There is
no beating about the bush for we know quite well what it was and
have got to tell It was Peters cockiness
This had got on Hooks nerves it made his iron claw twitch and
at night it disturbed him like an insect While Peter lived the tortured
man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come
The question now was how to get down the trees or how to get his
dogs down He ran his greedy eyes over them searching for the
thinnest ones They wriggled uncomfortably for they knew he would
not scruple to ram them down with poles
In the meantime what of the boys We have seen them at the first
clang of the weapons turned as it were into stone figures open
mouthed all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter and we
return to them as their mouths close and their arms fall to their sides
The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose
passed like a fierce gust of wind but they know that in the passing it
has determined their fate
Which side had won
The pirates listening avidly at the mouths of the trees heard the
question put by every boy and alas they also heard Peters answer
If the redskins have won he said they will beat the tomtom it
is always their sign of victory
Now Smee had found the tomtom and was at that moment sitting
on it You will never hear the tomtom again he muttered but
inaudibly of course for strict silence had been enjoined To his
amazement Hook signed him to beat the tomtom and slowly there
came to Smee an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the
order Never probably had this simple man admired Hook so much
Twice Smee beat upon the instrument and then stopped to listen
gleefully
The tomtom the miscreants heard Peter cry an Indian
victory
The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the
black hearts above and almost immediately they repeated their
goodbyes to Peter This puzzled the pirates but all their other
feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about
to come up the trees They smirked at each other and rubbed their
hands Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders one man to each
tree and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart
