There were only two beds in the nursery now Janes and her
nurses and there was no kennel for Nana also had passed away
She died of old age and at the end she had been rather difficult to get
on with being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look
after children except herself
Once a week Janes nurse had her evening off and then it was
Wendys part to put Jane to bed That was the time for stories It was
Janes invention to raise the sheet over her mothers head and her
own thus making a tent and in the awful darkness to whisper
What do we see now
I dont think I see anything tonight says Wendy with a feeling
that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation
Yes you do says Jane you see when you were a little girl
That is a long time ago sweetheart says Wendy Ah me how
time flies
Does it fly asks the artful child the way you flew when you
were a little girl
The way I flew Do you know Jane I sometimes wonder
whether I ever did really fly
Yes you did
The dear old days when I could fly
Why cant you fly now mother
Because I am grown up dearest When people grow up they
forget the way
Why do they forget the way
Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless It is
only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly
What is gay and innocent and heartless I do wish I were gay and
innocent and heartless
Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something
I do believe she says that it is this nursery
I do believe it is says Jane Go on
They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when
Peter flew in looking for his shadow
The foolish fellow says Wendy tried to stick it on with soap
and when he could not he cried and that woke me and I sewed it on
for him
You have missed a bit interrupts Jane who now knows the
story better than her mother When you saw him sitting on the floor
crying what did you say
I sat up in bed and I said Boy why are you crying
Yes that was it says Jane with a big breath
And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and
the pirates and the redskins and the mermaids lagoon and the home
under the ground and the little house
Yes which did you like best of all
I think I liked the home under the ground best of all
Yes so do I What was the last thing Peter ever said to you
