the bottle in your mouth again Nana and it is all my fault
Strong man though he was there is no doubt that he had behaved
rather foolishly over the medicine If he had a weakness it was for
thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly and so now
when Michael dodged the spoon in Nanas mouth he had said
reprovingly Be a man Michael
Wont wont Michael cried naughtily Mrs Darling left the
room to get a chocolate for him and Mr Darling thought this
showed want of firmness
Mother dont pamper him he called after her Michael when I
was your age I took medicine without a murmur I said Thank you
kind parents for giving me bottles to make me well
He really thought this was true and Wendy who was now in her
nightgown believed it also and she said to encourage Michael
That medicine you sometimes take father is much nastier isnt it
Ever so much nastier Mr Darling said bravely and I would
take it now as an example to you Michael if I hadnt lost the bottle
He had not exactly lost it he had climbed in the dead of night to
the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there What he did not know
was that the faithful Liza had found it and put it back on his wash
stand
I know where it is father Wendy cried always glad to be of
service Ill bring it and she was off before he could stop her
Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way
John he said shuddering its most beastly stuff Its that nasty
sticky sweet kind
It will soon be over father John said cheerily and then in
rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass
I have been as quick as I could she panted
You have been wonderfully quick her father retorted with a
vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her Michael
first he said doggedly
Father first said Michael who was of a suspicious nature
I shall be sick you know Mr Darling said threateningly
Come on father said John
Hold your tongue John his father rapped out
Wendy was quite puzzled I thought you took it quite easily
father
That is not the point he retorted The point is that there is
more in my glass than in Michaels spoon His proud heart was
nearly bursting And it isnt fair I would say it though it were with
my last breath it isnt fair
Father I am waiting said Michael coldly
Its all very well to say you are waiting so am I waiting
Fathers a cowardly custard
So are you a cowardly custard
Im not frightened
Neither am I frightened
Well then take it
