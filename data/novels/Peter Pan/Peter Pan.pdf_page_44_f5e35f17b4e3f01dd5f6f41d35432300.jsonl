there was one recess in the wall no larger than a birdcage which
was the private apartment of Tinker Bell It could be shut off from
the rest of the house by a tiny curtain which Tink who was most
fastidious always kept drawn when dressing or undressing No
woman however large could have had a more exquisite boudoir and
bedchamber combined The couch as she always called it was a
genuine Queen Mab with club legs and she varied the bedspreads
according to what fruitblossom was in season Her mirror was a
PussinBoots of which there are now only three unchipped known
to fairy dealers the washstand was Piecrust and reversible the chest
of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth and the carpet and rugs
the best the early period of Margery and Robin There was a
chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing but of course
she lit the residence herself Tink was very contemptuous of the rest
of the house as indeed was perhaps inevitable and her chamber
though beautiful looked rather conceited having the appearance of a
nose permanently turned up
I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy because those
rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do Really there were
whole weeks when except perhaps with a stocking in the evening
she was never above ground The cooking I can tell you kept her
nose to the pot and even if there was nothing in it even if there was
no pot she had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same
You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a
makebelieve it all depended upon Peters whim he could eat really
eat if it was part of a game but he could not stodge just to feel
stodgy which is what most children like better than anything else
the next best thing being to talk about it Makebelieve was so real to
him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder Of
course it was trying but you simply had to follow his lead and if
you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he
let you stodge
Wendys favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had
all gone to bed Then as she expressed it she had a breathing time
for herself and she occupied it in making new things for them and
putting double pieces on the knees for they were all most frightfully
hard on their knees
When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings every heel
with a hole in it she would fling up her arms and exclaim Oh dear
I am sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied
Her face beamed when she exclaimed this
You remember about her pet wolf Well it very soon discovered
that she had come to the island and it found her out and they just ran
into each others arms After that it followed her about everywhere
As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she
had left behind her This is a difficult question because it is quite
impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland where it
is calculated by moons and suns and there are ever so many more of
them than on the mainland But I am afraid that Wendy did not really
worry about her father and mother she was absolutely confident that
they would always keep the window open for her to fly back by and
this gave her complete ease of mind What did disturb her at times
was that John remembered his parents vaguely only as people he had
