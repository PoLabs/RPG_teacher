If only I had pretended to like the medicine was what Nanas
wet eyes said
My liking for parties George
My fatal gift of humour dearest
My touchiness about trifles dear master and mistress
Then one or more of them would break down altogether Nana at
the thought Its true its true they ought not to have had a dog for a
nurse Many a time it was Mr Darling who put the handkerchief to
Nanas eyes
That fiend Mr Darling would cry and Nanas bark was the
echo of it but Mrs Darling never upbraided Peter there was
something in the righthand corner of her mouth that wanted her not
to call Peter names
They would sit there in the empty nursery recalling fondly every
smallest detail of that dreadful evening It had begun so uneventfully
so precisely like a hundred other evenings with Nana putting on the
water for Michaels bath and carrying him to it on her back
I wont go to bed he had shouted like one who still believed
that he had the last word on the subject I wont I wont Nana it
isnt six oclock yet Oh dear oh dear I shant love you any more
Nana I tell you I wont be bathed I wont I wont
Then Mrs Darling had come in wearing her white eveninggown
She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her
eveninggown with the necklace George had given her She was
wearing Wendys bracelet on her arm she had asked for the loan of
it Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother
She had found her two older children playing at being herself and
father on the occasion of Wendys birth and John was saying
I am happy to inform you Mrs Darling that you are now a
mother in just such a tone as Mr Darling himself may have used on
the real occasion
Wendy had danced with joy just as the real Mrs Darling must
have done
Then John was born with the extra pomp that he conceived due to
the birth of a male and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born
also but John said brutally that they did not want any more
Michael had nearly cried Nobody wants me he said and of
course the lady in the eveningdress could not stand that
I do she said I so want a third child
Boy or girl asked Michael not too hopefully
Boy
Then he had leapt into her arms Such a little thing for Mr and
Mrs Darling and Nana to recall now but not so little if that was to be
Michaels last night in the nursery
They go on with their recollections
It was then that I rushed in like a tornado wasnt it Mr Darling
would say scorning himself and indeed he had been like a tornado
Perhaps there was some excuse for him He too had been
dressing for the party and all had gone well with him until he came
to his tie It is an astounding thing to have to tell but this man
