that they must never hit back at meals but should refer the matter of
dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying I
complain of soandso but what usually happened was that they
forgot to do this or did it too much
Silence cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told
them that they were not all to speak at once Is your mug empty
Slightly darling
Not quite empty mummy Slightly said after looking into an
imaginary mug
He hasnt even begun to drink his milk Nibs interposed
This was telling and Slightly seized his chance
I complain of Nibs he cried promptly
John however had held up his hand first
Well John
May I sit in Peters chair as he is not here
Sit in fathers chair John Wendy was scandalised Certainly
not
He is not really our father John answered He didnt even
know how a father does till I showed him
This was grumbling We complain of John cried the twins
Tootles held up his hand He was so much the humblest of them
indeed he was the only humble one that Wendy was specially gentle
with him
I dont suppose Tootles said diffidently that I could be father
No Tootles
Once Tootles began which was not very often he had a silly way
of going on
As I cant be father he said heavily I dont suppose Michael
you would let me be baby
No I wont Michael rapped out He was already in his basket
As I cant be baby Tootles said getting heavier and heavier and
heavier do you think I could be a twin
No indeed replied the twins its awfully difficult to be a
twin
As I cant be anything important said Tootles would any of
you like to see me do a trick
No they all replied
Then at last he stopped I hadnt really any hope he said
The hateful telling broke out again
Slightly is coughing on the table
The twins began with cheesecakes
Curly is taking both butter and honey
Nibs is speaking with his mouth full
I complain of the twins
I complain of Curly
I complain of Nibs
