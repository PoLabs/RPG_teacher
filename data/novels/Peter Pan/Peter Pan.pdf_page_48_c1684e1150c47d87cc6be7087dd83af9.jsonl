It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a
rock for half an hour after their midday meal Wendy insisted on
their doing this and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was
makebelieve So they lay there in the sun and their bodies glistened
in it while she sat beside them and looked important
It was one such day and they were all on Marooners Rock The
rock was not much larger than their great bed but of course they all
knew how not to take up much room and they were dozing or at
least lying with their eyes shut and pinching occasionally when they
thought Wendy was not looking She was very busy stitching
While she stitched a change came to the lagoon Little shivers ran
over it and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water
turning it cold Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle and
when she looked up the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a
laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly
It was not she knew that night had come but something as dark
as night had come No worse than that It had not come but it had
sent that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming What was
it
There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of
Marooners Rock so called because evil captains put sailors on it
and leave them there to drown They drown when the tide rises for
then it is submerged
Of course she should have roused the children at once not merely
because of the unknown that was stalking toward them but because
it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly But
she was a young mother and she did not know this she thought you
simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after the midday
meal So though fear was upon her and she longed to hear male
voices she would not waken them Even when she heard the sound
of muffled oars though her heart was in her mouth she did not
waken them She stood over them to let them have their sleep out
Was it not brave of Wendy
It was well for those boys then that there was one among them
who could sniff danger even in his sleep Peter sprang erect as wide
awake at once as a dog and with one warning cry he roused the
others
He stood motionless one hand to his ear
Pirates he cried The others came closer to him A strange smile
was playing about his face and Wendy saw it and shuddered While
that smile was on his face no one dared address him all they could
do was to stand ready to obey The order came sharp and incisive
Dive
There was a gleam of legs and instantly the lagoon seemed
deserted Marooners Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if
it were itself marooned
The boat drew nearer It was the pirate dinghy with three figures
in her Smee and Starkey and the third a captive no other than Tiger
Lily Her hands and ankles were tied and she knew what was to be
her fate She was to be left on the rock to perish an end to one of her
race more terrible than death by fire or torture for is it not written in
the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happy
