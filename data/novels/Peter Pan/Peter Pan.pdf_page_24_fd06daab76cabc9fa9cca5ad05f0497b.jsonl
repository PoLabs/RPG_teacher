Then tell him to stop showing off said John
When playing Follow my Leader Peter would fly close to the
water and touch each sharks tail in passing just as in the street you
may run your finger along an iron railing They could not follow him
in this with much success so perhaps it was rather like showing off
especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they
missed
You must be nice to him Wendy impressed on her brothers
What could we do if he were to leave us
We could go back Michael said
How could we ever find our way back without him
Well then we could go on said John
That is the awful thing John We should have to go on for we
dont know how to stop
This was true Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop
John said that if the worst came to the worst all they had to do
was to go straight on for the world was round and so in time they
must come back to their own window
And who is to get food for us John
I nipped a bit out of that eagles mouth pretty neatly Wendy
After the twentieth try Wendy reminded him And even though
we became good at picking up food see how we bump against
clouds and things if he is not near to give us a hand
Indeed they were constantly bumping They could now fly
strongly though they still kicked far too much but if they saw a
cloud in front of them the more they tried to avoid it the more
certainly did they bump into it If Nana had been with them she
would have had a bandage round Michaels forehead by this time
Peter was not with them for the moment and they felt rather
lonely up there by themselves He could go so much faster than they
that he would suddenly shoot out of sight to have some adventure in
which they had no share He would come down laughing over
something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star but he had
already forgotten what it was or he would come up with mermaid
scales still sticking to him and yet not be able to say for certain what
had been happening It was really rather irritating to children who
had never seen a mermaid
And if he forgets them so quickly Wendy argued how can we
expect that he will go on remembering us
Indeed sometimes when he returned he did not remember them at
least not well Wendy was sure of it She saw recognition come into
his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on
once even she had to call him by name
Im Wendy she said agitatedly
He was very sorry I say Wendy he whispered to her always if
you see me forgetting you just keep on saying Im Wendy and
then Ill remember
Of course this was rather unsatisfactory However to make
amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was
going their way and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it
