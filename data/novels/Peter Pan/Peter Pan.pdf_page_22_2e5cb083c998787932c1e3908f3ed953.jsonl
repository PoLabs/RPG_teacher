They were all on their beds and gallant Michael let go first He
did not quite mean to let go but he did it and immediately he was
borne across the room
I flewed he screamed while still in midair
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom
Oh lovely
Oh ripping
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me
They were not nearly so elegant as Peter they could not help
kicking a little but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling and
there is almost nothing so delicious as that Peter gave Wendy a hand
at first but had to desist Tink was so indignant
Up and down they went and round and round Heavenly was
Wendys word
I say cried John why shouldnt we all go out
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them
Michael was ready he wanted to see how long it took him to do a
billion miles But Wendy hesitated
Mermaids said Peter again
Oo
And there are pirates
Pirates cried John seizing his Sunday hat let us go at once
It was just at this moment that Mr and Mrs Darling hurried with
Nana out of 27 They ran into the middle of the street to look up at
the nursery window and yes it was still shut but the room was
ablaze with light and most heartgripping sight of all they could see
in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling
round and round not on the floor but in the air
Not three figures four
In a tremble they opened the street door Mr Darling would have
rushed upstairs but Mrs Darling signed him to go softly She even
tried to make her heart go softly
Will they reach the nursery in time If so how delightful for them
and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief but there will be no story On
the other hand if they are not in time I solemnly promise that it will
all come right in the end
They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that
the little stars were watching them Once again the stars blew the
window open and that smallest star of all called out
Cave Peter
Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose Come he
cried imperiously and soared out at once into the night followed by
John and Michael and Wendy
Mr and Mrs Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late
The birds were flown
