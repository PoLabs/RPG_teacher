seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry Would it not
serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their
parents were spending the weekend in the country It would be the
moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them but
if we contrived things in this way Mrs Darling would never forgive
us
One thing I should like to do immensely and that is to tell her in
the way authors have that the children are coming back that indeed
they will be here on Thursday week This would spoil so completely
the surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking
forward They have been planning it out on the ship mothers
rapture fathers shout of joy Nanas leap through the air to embrace
them first when what they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding
How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in advance so that
when they enter grandly Mrs Darling may not even offer Wendy her
mouth and Mr Darling may exclaim pettishly Dash it all here are
those boys again However we should get no thanks even for this
We are beginning to know Mrs Darling by this time and may be
sure that she would upbraid us for depriving the children of their
little pleasure
But my dear madam it is ten days till Thursday week so that by
telling you whats what we can save you ten days of unhappiness
Yes but at what a cost By depriving the children of ten minutes
of delight
Oh if you look at it in that way
What other way is there in which to look at it
You see the woman had no proper spirit I had meant to say
extraordinarily nice things about her but I despise her and not one
of them will I say now She does not really need to be told to have
things ready for they are ready All the beds are aired and she never
leaves the house and observe the window is open For all the use we
are to her we might well go back to the ship However as we are
here we may as well stay and look on That is all we are lookerson
Nobody really wants us So let us watch and say jaggy things in the
hope that some of them will hurt
The only change to be seen in the nightnursery is that between
nine and six the kennel is no longer there When the children flew
away Mr Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for
having chained Nana up and that from first to last she had been
wiser than he Of course as we have seen he was quite a simple
man indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been
able to take his baldness off but he had also a noble sense of justice
and a lions courage to do what seemed right to him and having
thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the
children he went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel To
all Mrs Darlings dear invitations to him to come out he replied
sadly but firmly
No my own one this is the place for me
In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave
the kennel until his children came back Of course this was a pity
but whatever Mr Darling did he had to do in excess otherwise he
soon gave up doing it And there never was a more humble man than
