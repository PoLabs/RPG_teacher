than ten oclock by the crocodile when he suddenly sat up in his
bed wakened by he knew not what It was a soft cautious tapping on
the door of his tree
Soft and cautious but in that stillness it was sinister Peter felt for
his dagger till his hand gripped it Then he spoke
Who is that
For long there was no answer then again the knock
Who are you
No answer
He was thrilled and he loved being thrilled In two strides he
reached the door Unlike Slightlys door it filled the aperture so that
he could not see beyond it nor could the one knocking see him
I wont open unless you speak Peter cried
Then at last the visitor spoke in a lovely belllike voice
Let me in Peter
It was Tink and quickly he unbarred to her She flew in excitedly
her face flushed and her dress stained with mud
What is it
Oh you could never guess she cried and offered him three
guesses Out with it he shouted and in one ungrammatical
sentence as long as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their
mouths she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys
Peters heart bobbed up and down as he listened Wendy bound
and on the pirate ship she who loved everything to be just so
Ill rescue her he cried leaping at his weapons As he leapt he
thought of something he could do to please her He could take his
medicine
His hand closed on the fatal draught
No shrieked Tinker Bell who had heard Hook mutter about his
deed as he sped through the forest
Why not
It is poisoned
Poisoned Who could have poisoned it
Hook
Dont be silly How could Hook have got down here
Alas Tinker Bell could not explain this for even she did not know
the dark secret of Slightlys tree Nevertheless Hooks words had left
no room for doubt The cup was poisoned
Besides said Peter quite believing himself I never fell
asleep
He raised the cup No time for words now time for deeds and
with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and
the draught and drained it to the dregs
Why Tink how dare you drink my medicine
But she did not answer Already she was reeling in the air
What is the matter with you cried Peter suddenly afraid
It was poisoned Peter she told him softly and now I am going
to be dead
