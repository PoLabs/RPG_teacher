They had been flying apart but they huddled close to Peter now
His careless manner had gone at last his eyes were sparkling and a
tingle went through them every time they touched his body They
were now over the fearsome island flying so low that sometimes a
tree grazed their feet Nothing horrid was visible in the air yet their
progress had become slow and laboured exactly as if they were
pushing their way through hostile forces Sometimes they hung in
the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists
They dont want us to land he explained
Who are they Wendy whispered shuddering
But he could not or would not say Tinker Bell had been asleep on
his shoulder but now he wakened her and sent her on in front
Sometimes he poised himself in the air listening intently with his
hand to his ear and again he would stare down with eyes so bright
that they seemed to bore two holes to earth Having done these
things he went on again
His courage was almost appalling Would you like an adventure
now he said casually to John or would you like to have your tea
first
Wendy said tea first quickly and Michael pressed her hand in
gratitude but the braver John hesitated
What kind of adventure he asked cautiously
Theres a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us Peter told
him If you like well go down and kill him
I dont see him John said after a long pause
I do
Suppose John said a little huskily he were to wake up
Peter spoke indignantly You dont think I would kill him while
he was sleeping I would wake him first and then kill him Thats the
way I always do
I say Do you kill many
Tons
John said How ripping but decided to have tea first He asked if
there were many pirates on the island just now and Peter said he had
never known so many
Who is captain now
Hook answered Peter and his face became very stern as he said
that hated word
Jas Hook
Ay
Then indeed Michael began to cry and even John could speak in
gulps only for they knew Hooks reputation
He was Blackbeards bosun John whispered huskily He is the
worst of them all He is the only man of whom Barbecue was
afraid
Thats him said Peter
What is he like Is he big
He is not so big as he was
