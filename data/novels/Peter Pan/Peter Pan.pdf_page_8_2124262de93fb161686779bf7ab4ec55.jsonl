Chapter II
THE SHADOW
Mrs Darling screamed and as if in answer to a bell the door
opened and Nana entered returned from her evening out She
growled and sprang at the boy who leapt lightly through the window
Again Mrs Darling screamed this time in distress for him for she
thought he was killed and she ran down into the street to look for his
little body but it was not there and she looked up and in the black
night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star
She returned to the nursery and found Nana with something in her
mouth which proved to be the boys shadow As he leapt at the
window Nana had closed it quickly too late to catch him but his
shadow had not had time to get out slam went the window and
snapped it off
You may be sure Mrs Darling examined the shadow carefully but
it was quite the ordinary kind
Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this
shadow She hung it out at the window meaning He is sure to come
back for it let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing
the children
But unfortunately Mrs Darling could not leave it hanging out at
the window it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole
tone of the house She thought of showing it to Mr Darling but he
was totting up winter greatcoats for John and Michael with a wet
towel around his head to keep his brain clear and it seemed a shame
to trouble him besides she knew exactly what he would say It all
comes of having a dog for a nurse
She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a
drawer until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband Ah
me
The opportunity came a week later on that nevertobeforgotten
Friday Of course it was a Friday
I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday she used to
say afterwards to her husband while perhaps Nana was on the other
side of her holding her hand
No no Mr Darling always said I am responsible for it all I
George Darling did it Mea culpa mea culpa He had had a
classical education
They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday till every
detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the
other side like the faces on a bad coinage
If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27 Mrs
Darling said
If only I had not poured my medicine into Nanas bowl said Mr
Darling
