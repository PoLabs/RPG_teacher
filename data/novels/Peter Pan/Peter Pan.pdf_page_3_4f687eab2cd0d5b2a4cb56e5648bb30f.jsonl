Now dont interrupt he would beg of her

Of course we can George she cried But she was prejudiced in
Wendys favour and he was really the grander character of the two
Remember mumps he warned her almost threateningly and off
he went again Mumps one pound that is what I have put down but
I daresay it will be more like thirty shillingsdont speakmeasles
one five German measles half a guinea makes two fifteen six
dont waggle your fingerwhoopingcough say fifteen shillings
and so on it went and it added up differently each time but at last
Wendy just got through with mumps reduced to twelve six and the
two kinds of measles treated as one
There was the same excitement over John and Michael had even a
narrower squeak but both were kept and soon you might have seen
the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsoms Kindergarten
school accompanied by their nurse
Mrs Darling loved to have everything just so and Mr Darling had
a passion for being exactly like his neighbours so of course they
had a nurse As they were poor owing to the amount of milk the
children drank this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog called
Nana who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings
engaged her She had always thought children important however
and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington
Gardens where she spent most of her spare time peeping into
perambulators and was much hated by careless nursemaids whom
she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses
She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse How thorough she was
at bathtime and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges
made the slightest cry Of course her kennel was in the nursery She
had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no
patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat She
believed to her last day in oldfashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf
and made sounds of contempt over all this newfangled talk about
germs and so on It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the
children to school walking sedately by their side when they were
well behaved and butting them back into line if they strayed On
Johns footer days she never once forgot his sweater and she usually
carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain There is a room in
the basement of Miss Fulsoms school where the nurses wait They
sat on forms while Nana lay on the floor but that was the only
difference They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status
to themselves and she despised their light talk She resented visits to
the nursery from Mrs Darlings friends but if they did come she first
whipped off Michaels pinafore and put him into the one with blue
braiding and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at Johns hair
