to happen before the night was out If she had known she would not
have snapped
None of them knew Perhaps it was best not to know Their
ignorance gave them one more glad hour and as it was to be their
last hour on the island let us rejoice that there were sixty glad
minutes in it They sang and danced in their nightgowns Such a
deliciously creepy song it was in which they pretended to be
frightened at their own shadows little witting that so soon shadows
would close in upon them from whom they would shrink in real fear
So uproariously gay was the dance and how they buffeted each other
on the bed and out of it It was a pillow fight rather than a dance and
when it was finished the pillows insisted on one bout more like
partners who know that they may never meet again The stories they
told before it was time for Wendys goodnight story Even Slightly
tried to tell a story that night but the beginning was so fearfully dull
that it appalled not only the others but himself and he said gloomily
Yes it is a dull beginning I say let us pretend that it is the end
And then at last they all got into bed for Wendys story the story
they loved best the story Peter hated Usually when she began to tell
this story he left the room or put his hands over his ears and possibly
if he had done either of those things this time they might all still be
on the island But tonight he remained on his stool and we shall see
what happened
