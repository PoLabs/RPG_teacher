Chapter XIII
DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES
The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better The first to
emerge from his tree was Curly He rose out of it into the arms of
Cecco who flung him to Smee who flung him to Starkey who flung
him to Bill Jukes who flung him to Noodler and so he was tossed
from one to another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate All the
boys were plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner and
several of them were in the air at a time like bales of goods flung
from hand to hand
A different treatment was accorded to Wendy who came last With
ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her and offering her his
arm escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged He
did it with such an air he was so frightfully distingu that she was
too fascinated to cry out She was only a little girl
Perhaps it is telltale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced
her and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results
Had she haughtily unhanded him and we should have loved to write
it of her she would have been hurled through the air like the others

say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence His lip was
curled with malicious triumph While his dogs were merely sweating
because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one
part he bulged out in another Hooks master mind had gone far
beneath Slightlys surface probing not for effects but for causes and
his exultation showed that he had found them Slightly white to the
gills knew that Hook had surprised his secret which was this that
no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need
stick Poor Slightly most wretched of all the children now for he
was in a panic about Peter bitterly regretted what he had done
Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot he had
swelled in consequence to his present girth and instead of reducing
