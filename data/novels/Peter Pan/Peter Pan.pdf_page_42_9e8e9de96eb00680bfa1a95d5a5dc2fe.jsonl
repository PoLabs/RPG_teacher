He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are they
were all too busy looking their best
He knocked politely and now the wood was as still as the
children not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell who was
watching from a branch and openly sneering
What the boys were wondering was would any one answer the
knock If a lady what would she be like
The door opened and a lady came out It was Wendy They all
whipped off their hats
She looked properly surprised and this was just how they had
hoped she would look
Where am I she said
Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in Wendy lady
he said rapidly for you we built this house
Oh say youre pleased cried Nibs
Lovely darling house Wendy said and they were the very
words they had hoped she would say
And we are your children cried the twins
Then all went on their knees and holding out their arms cried O
Wendy lady be our mother
Ought I Wendy said all shining Of course its frightfully
fascinating but you see I am only a little girl I have no real
experience
That doesnt matter said Peter as if he were the only person
present who knew all about it though he was really the one who
knew least What we need is just a nice motherly person
Oh dear Wendy said you see I feel that is exactly what I am
It is it is they all cried we saw it at once
Very well she said I will do my best Come inside at once
you naughty children I am sure your feet are damp And before I put
you to bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella
In they went I dont know how there was room for them but you
can squeeze very tight in the Neverland And that was the first of the
many joyous evenings they had with Wendy By and by she tucked
them up in the great bed in the home under the trees but she herself
slept that night in the little house and Peter kept watch outside with
drawn sword for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and
the wolves were on the prowl The little house looked so cosy and
safe in the darkness with a bright light showing through its blinds
and the chimney smoking beautifully and Peter standing on guard
After a time he fell asleep and some unsteady fairies had to climb
over him on their way home from an orgy Any of the other boys
obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed but
they just tweaked Peters nose and passed on
