Oh dear said the nice Wendy I dont mean a kiss I mean a
thimble
Whats that
Its like this She kissed him
Funny said Peter gravely Now shall I give you a thimble
If you wish to said Wendy keeping her head erect this time
Peter thimbled her and almost immediately she screeched What
is it Wendy
It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair
That must have been Tink I never knew her so naughty before
And indeed Tink was darting about again using offensive
language
She says she will do that to you Wendy every time I give you a
thimble
But why
Why Tink
Again Tink replied You silly ass Peter could not understand
why but Wendy understood and she was just slightly disappointed
when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her
but to listen to stories
You see I dont know any stories None of the lost boys knows
any stories
How perfectly awful Wendy said
Do you know Peter asked why swallows build in the eaves of
houses It is to listen to the stories O Wendy your mother was
telling you such a lovely story
Which story was it
About the prince who couldnt find the lady who wore the glass
slipper
Peter said Wendy excitedly that was Cinderella and he found
her and they lived happily ever after
Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor where they had been
sitting and hurried to the window
Where are you going she cried with misgiving
To tell the other boys
Dont go Peter she entreated I know such lots of stories
Those were her precise words so there can be no denying that it
was she who first tempted him
He came back and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which
ought to have alarmed her but did not
Oh the stories I could tell to the boys she cried and then Peter
gripped her and began to draw her toward the window
Let me go she ordered him
Wendy do come with me and tell the other boys
Of course she was very pleased to be asked but she said Oh
dear I cant Think of mummy Besides I cant fly
Ill teach you
