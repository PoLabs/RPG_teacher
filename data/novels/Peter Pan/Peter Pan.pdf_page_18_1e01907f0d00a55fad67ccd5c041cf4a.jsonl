Of course Im very sorry but how could I know you were in the
drawer
Wendy was not listening to him O Peter she cried if she
would only stand still and let me see her
They hardly ever stand still he said but for one moment Wendy
saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock O the
lovely she cried though Tinks face was still distorted with
passion
Tink said Peter amiably this lady says she wishes you were
her fairy
Tinker Bell answered insolently
What does she say Peter
He had to translate She is not very polite She says you are a
great ugly girl and that she is my fairy
He tried to argue with Tink You know you cant be my fairy
Tink because I am an gentleman and you are a lady
To this Tink replied in these words You silly ass and
disappeared into the bathroom She is quite a common fairy Peter
explained apologetically she is called Tinker Bell because she
mends the pots and kettles
They were together in the armchair by this time and Wendy plied
him with more questions
If you dont live in Kensington Gardens now
Sometimes I do still
But where do you live mostly now
With the lost boys
Who are they
They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when
the nurse is looking the other way If they are not claimed in seven
days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses Im
captain
What fun it must be
Yes said cunning Peter but we are rather lonely You see we
have no female companionship
Are none of the others girls
Oh no girls you know are much too clever to fall out of their
prams
This flattered Wendy immensely I think she said it is
perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls John there just despises
us
For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed blankets and all
one kick This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting
and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house
However John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she
allowed him to remain there And I know you meant to be kind
she said relenting so you may give me a kiss
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses I
thought you would want it back he said a little bitterly and offered
to return her the thimble
