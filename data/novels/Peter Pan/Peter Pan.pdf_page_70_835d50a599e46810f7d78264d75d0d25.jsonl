Chapter XII
THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF
The pirate attack had been a complete surprise a sure proof that
the unscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly for to surprise
redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man
By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the
redskin who attacks and with the wiliness of his race he does it just
before the dawn at which time he knows the courage of the whites to
be at its lowest ebb The white men have in the meantime made a
rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground at the foot
of which a stream runs for it is destruction to be too far from water
There they await the onslaught the inexperienced ones clutching
their revolvers and treading on twigs but the old hands sleeping
tranquilly until just before the dawn Through the long black night
the savage scouts wriggle snakelike among the grass without
stirring a blade The brushwood closes behind them as silently as
sand into which a mole has dived Not a sound is to be heard save
when they give vent to a wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the
coyote The cry is answered by other braves and some of them do it
even better than the coyotes who are not very good at it So the chill
hours wear on and the long suspense is horribly trying to the
paleface who has to live through it for the first time but to the
trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an
intimation of how the night is marching
That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that
in disregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance
The Piccaninnies on their part trusted implicitly to his honour
and their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to
his They left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation
of their tribe With that alertness of the senses which is at once the
marvel and despair of civilised peoples they knew that the pirates
were on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick
and in an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began
Every foot of ground between the spot where Hook had landed his
forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined by
braves wearing their mocassins with the heels in front They found
only one hillock with a stream at its base so that Hook had no
choice here he must establish himself and wait for just before the
dawn Everything being thus mapped out with almost diabolical
cunning the main body of the redskins folded their blankets around
them and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them the pearl of
manhood squatted above the childrens home awaiting the cold
moment when they should deal pale death
Here dreaming though wideawake of the exquisite tortures to
which they were to put him at break of day those confiding savages
were found by the treacherous Hook From the accounts afterwards
