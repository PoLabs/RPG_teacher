One Slightly had begun to count
None too soon Peter every inch of him on tiptoe vanished into
the cabin for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to
look round They could hear each others distressed breathing now
which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed
Its gone captain Smee said wiping off his spectacles Alls
still again
Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff and listened so
intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick There was not
a sound and he drew himself up firmly to his full height
Then heres to Johnny Plank he cried brazenly hating the boys
more than ever because they had seen him unbend He broke into the
villainous ditty
Yo ho yo ho the frisky plank
You walks along it so
Till it goes down and you goes down
To Davy Jones below
To terrorise the prisoners the more though with a certain loss of
dignity he danced along an imaginary plank grimacing at them as he
sang and when he finished he cried Do you want a touch of the cat
before you walk the plank
At that they fell on their knees No no they cried so piteously
that every pirate smiled
Fetch the cat Jukes said Hook its in the cabin
The cabin Peter was in the cabin The children gazed at each
other
Ay ay said Jukes blithely and he strode into the cabin They
followed him with their eyes they scarce knew that Hook had
resumed his song his dogs joining in with him
Yo ho yo ho the scratching cat
Its tails are nine you know
And when theyre writ upon your back
What was the last line will never be known for of a sudden the
song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin It wailed
through the ship and died away Then was heard a crowing sound
which was well understood by the boys but to the pirates was almost
more eerie than the screech
What was that cried Hook
Two said Slightly solemnly
The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the
cabin He tottered out haggard
Whats the matter with Bill Jukes you dog hissed Hook
towering over him
The matter wi him is hes dead stabbed replied Cecco in a
hollow voice
Bill Jukes dead cried the startled pirates
The cabins as black as a pit Cecco said almost gibbering but
there is something terrible in there the thing you heard crowing
