As for Peter he saw Wendy once again before he flew away He
did not exactly come to the window but he brushed against it in
passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him That is
what she did
Hullo Wendy goodbye he said
Oh dear are you going away
Yes
You dont feel Peter she said falteringly that you would like
to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject
No
About me Peter
No
Mrs Darling came to the window for at present she was keeping a
sharp eye on Wendy She told Peter that she had adopted all the other
boys and would like to adopt him also
Would you send me to school he inquired craftily
Yes
And then to an office
I suppose so
Soon I would be a man
Very soon
I dont want to go to school and learn solemn things he told her
passionately I dont want to be a man O Wendys mother if I was
to wake up and feel there was a beard
Peter said Wendy the comforter I should love you in a beard
and Mrs Darling stretched out her arms to him but he repulsed her
Keep back lady no one is going to catch me and make me a
man
But where are you going to live
With Tink in the house we built for Wendy The fairies are to put
it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights
How lovely cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs Darling
tightened her grip
I thought all the fairies were dead Mrs Darling said
There are always a lot of young ones explained Wendy who
was now quite an authority because you see when a new baby
laughs for the first time a new fairy is born and as there are always
new babies there are always new fairies They live in nests on the
tops of trees and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are
girls and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what
they are
I shall have such fun said Peter with eye on Wendy
It will be rather lonely in the evening she said sitting by the
fire
I shall have Tink
Tink cant go a twentieth part of the way round she reminded
him a little tartly
