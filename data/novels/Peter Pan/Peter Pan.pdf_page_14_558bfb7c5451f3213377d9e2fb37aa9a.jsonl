Chapter III
COME AWAY COME AWAY
For a moment after Mr and Mrs Darling left the house the night
lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly
They were awfully nice little nightlights and one cannot help
wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter but Wendys
light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also
and before they could close their mouths all the three went out
There was another light in the room now a thousand times
brighter than the nightlights and in the time we have taken to say
this it had been in all the drawers in the nursery looking for Peters
shadow rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out
It was not really a light it made this light by flashing about so
quickly but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy
no longer than your hand but still growing It was a girl called
Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf cut low and
square through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage
She was slightly inclined to embonpoint
A moment after the fairys entrance the window was blown open
by the breathing of the little stars and Peter dropped in He had
carried Tinker Bell part of the way and his hand was still messy with
the fairy dust
Tinker Bell he called softly after making sure that the children
were asleep Tink where are you She was in a jug for the
moment and liking it extremely she had never been in a jug before
Oh do come out of that jug and tell me do you know where
they put my shadow
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him It is the fairy
language You ordinary children can never hear it but if you were to
hear it you would know that you had heard it once before
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box She meant the chest
of drawers and Peter jumped at the drawers scattering their contents
to the floor with both hands as kings toss hapence to the crowd In a
moment he had recovered his shadow and in his delight he forgot
that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer
If he thought at all but I dont believe he ever thought it was that
he and his shadow when brought near each other would join like
drops of water and when they did not he was appalled He tried to
stick it on with soap from the bathroom but that also failed A
shudder passed through Peter and he sat on the floor and cried
His sobs woke Wendy and she sat up in bed She was not alarmed
to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor she was only pleasantly
interested
Boy she said courteously why are you crying
