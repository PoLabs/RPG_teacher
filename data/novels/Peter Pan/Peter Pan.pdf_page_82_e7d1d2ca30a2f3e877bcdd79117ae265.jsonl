Through Hooks teeth came the answer You would have to
swear Down with the King
Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far but he shone out
now
Then I refuse he cried banging the barrel in front of Hook
And I refuse cried Michael
Rule Britannia squeaked Curly
The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth and Hook
roared out That seals your doom Bring up their mother Get the
plank ready
They were only boys and they went white as they saw Jukes and
Cecco preparing the fatal plank But they tried to look brave when
Wendy was brought up
No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates
To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling but
all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years There
was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have
written with your finger Dirty pig and she had already written it
on several But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought of
course save for them
So my beauty said Hook as if he spoke in syrup you are to
see your children walk the plank
Fine gentlemen though he was the intensity of his communings
had soiled his ruff and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it
With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it but he was too late
Are they to die asked Wendy with a look of such frightful
contempt that he nearly fainted
They are he snarled Silence all he called gloatingly for a
mothers last words to her children
At this moment Wendy was grand These are my last words dear
boys she said firmly I feel that I have a message to you from your
real mothers and it is this We hope our sons will die like English
gentlemen
Even the pirates were awed and Tootles cried out hysterically I
am going to do what my mother hopes What are you to do Nibs
What my mother hopes What are you to do Twin
What my mother hopes John what are
But Hook had found his voice again
Tie her up he shouted
It was Smee who tied her to the mast See here honey he
whispered Ill save you if you promise to be my mother
But not even for Smee would she make such a promise I would
almost rather have no children at all she said disdainfully
It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her
to the mast the eyes of all were on the plank that last little walk
they were about to take They were no longer able to hope that they
would walk it manfully for the capacity to think had gone from
them they could stare and shiver only
