Yes I know Wendy admitted rather forlornly no one knows it
so well as I
Goodbye said Peter to Wendy and he rose in the air and the
shameless Jane rose with him it was already her easiest way of
moving about
Wendy rushed to the window
No no she cried
It is just for spring cleaning time Jane said he wants me
always to do his spring cleaning
If only I could go with you Wendy sighed
You see you cant fly said Jane
Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together Our last
glimpse of her shows her at the window watching them receding
into the sky until they were as small as stars
As you look at Wendy you may see her hair becoming white and
her figure little again for all this happened long ago Jane is now a
common grownup with a daughter called Margaret and every
spring cleaning time except when he forgets Peter comes for
Margaret and takes her to the Neverland where she tells him stories
about himself to which he listens eagerly When Margaret grows up
she will have a daughter who is to be Peters mother in turn and
thus it will go on so long as children are gay and innocent and
heartless
