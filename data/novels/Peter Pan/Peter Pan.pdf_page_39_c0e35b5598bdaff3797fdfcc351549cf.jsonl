Then they had to tell Peter of Tinks crime and almost never had
they seen him look so stern
Listen Tinker Bell he cried I am your friend no more Begone
from me for ever
She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded but he brushed her off
Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to
say Well not for ever but for a whole week
Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her
arm Oh dear no never wanted to pinch her so much Fairies indeed
are strange and Peter who understood them best often cuffed them
But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health
Let us carry her down into the house Curly suggested
Ay said Slightly that is what one does with ladies
No no Peter said you must not touch her It would not be
sufficiently respectful
That said Slightly is what I was thinking
But if she lies there Tootles said she will die
Ay she will die Slightly admitted but there is no way out
Yes there is cried Peter Let us build a little house round her
They were all delighted Quick he ordered them bring me
each of you the best of what we have Gut our house Be sharp
In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a
wedding They skurried this way and that down for bedding up for
firewood and while they were at it who should appear but John and
Michael As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing
stopped woke up moved another step and slept again
John John Michael would cry wake up Where is Nana John
and mother
And then John would rub his eyes and mutter It is true we did
fly
You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter
Hullo Peter they said
Hullo replied Peter amicably though he had quite forgotten
them He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his
feet to see how large a house she would need Of course he meant to
leave room for chairs and a table John and Michael watched him
Is Wendy asleep they asked
Yes
John Michael proposed let us wake her and get her to make
supper for us but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on
carrying branches for the building of the house Look at them he
cried
Curly said Peter in his most captainy voice see that these boys
help in the building of the house
Ay ay sir
Build a house exclaimed John
For the Wendy said Curly
For Wendy John said aghast Why she is only a girl
