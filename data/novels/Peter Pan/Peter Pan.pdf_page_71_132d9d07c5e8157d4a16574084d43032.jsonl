supplied by such of the scouts as escaped the carnage he does not
seem even to have paused at the rising ground though it is certain
that in that grey light he must have seen it no thought of waiting to
be attacked appears from first to last to have visited his subtle mind
he would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent on he
pounded with no policy but to fall to What could the bewildered
scouts do masters as they were of every warlike artifice save this
one but trot helplessly after him exposing themselves fatally to
view while they gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry
Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors
and they suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon
them Fell from their eyes then the film through which they had
looked at victory No more would they torture at the stake For them
the happy huntinggrounds was now They knew it but as their
fathers sons they acquitted themselves Even then they had time to
gather in a phalanx that would have been hard to break had they
risen quickly but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of
their race It is written that the noble savage must never express
surprise in the presence of the white Thus terrible as the sudden
appearance of the pirates must have been to them they remained
stationary for a moment not a muscle moving as if the foe had come
by invitation Then indeed the tradition gallantly upheld they
seized their weapons and the air was torn with the warcry but it
was now too late
It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a
fight Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe Not
all unavenged did they die for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason to
disturb the Spanish Main no more and among others who bit the
dust were Geo Scourie Chas Turley and the Alsatian Foggerty
Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther who ultimately
cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of
the tribe
To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is
for the historian to decide Had he waited on the rising ground till the
proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered
and in judging him it is only fair to take this into account What he
should perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he
proposed to follow a new method On the other hand this as
destroying the element of surprise would have made his strategy of
no avail so that the whole question is beset with difficulties One
cannot at least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had
conceived so bold a scheme and the fell genius with which it was
carried out
What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant
moment Fain would his dogs have known as breathing heavily and
wiping their cutlasses they gathered at a discreet distance from his
hook and squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary
man Elation must have been in his heart but his face did not reflect
it ever a dark and solitary enigma he stood aloof from his followers
in spirit as in substance
The nights work was not yet over for it was not the redskins he
had come out to destroy they were but the bees to be smoked so
