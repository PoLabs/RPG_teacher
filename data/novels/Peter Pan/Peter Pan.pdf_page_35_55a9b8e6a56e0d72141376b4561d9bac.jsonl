They examined the mushroom which was of a size and solidity
unknown on the mainland they tried to pull it up and it came away
at once in their hands for it had no root Stranger still smoke began
at once to ascend The pirates looked at each other A chimney
they both exclaimed
They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the
ground It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom
when enemies were in the neighbourhood
Not only smoke came out of it There came also childrens voices
for so safe did the boys feel in their hidingplace that they were gaily
chattering The pirates listened grimly and then replaced the
mushroom They looked around them and noted the holes in the
seven trees
Did you hear them say Peter Pans from home Smee
whispered fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew
Hook nodded He stood for a long time lost in thought and at last
a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face Smee had been waiting for
it Unrip your plan captain he cried eagerly
To return to the ship Hook replied slowly through his teeth
and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on
it There can be but one room below for there is but one chimney
The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door
apiece That shows they have no mother We will leave the cake on
the shore of the Mermaids Lagoon These boys are always
swimming about there playing with the mermaids They will find
the cake and they will gobble it up because having no mother they
dont know how dangerous tis to eat rich damp cake He burst into
laughter not hollow laughter now but honest laughter Aha they
will die
Smee had listened with growing admiration
Its the wickedest prettiest policy ever I heard of he cried and
in their exultation they danced and sang
Avast belay when I appear
By fear theyre overtook
Noughts left upon your bones when you
Have shaken claws with Hook
They began the verse but they never finished it for another sound
broke in and stilled them There was at first such a tiny sound that a
leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it but as it came nearer it
was more distinct
Tick tick tick tick
Hook stood shuddering one foot in the air
The crocodile he gasped and bounded away followed by his
bosun
It was indeed the crocodile It had passed the redskins who were
now on the trail of the other pirates It oozed on after Hook
Once more the boys emerged into the open but the dangers of the
night were not yet over for presently Nibs rushed breathless into
their midst pursued by a pack of wolves The tongues of the
pursuers were hanging out the baying of them was horrible
