Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he
returned to the home where an unworthy scene had been enacted in
his absence Panicstricken at the thought of losing Wendy the lost
boys had advanced upon her threateningly
It will be worse than before she came they cried
We shant let her go
Lets keep her prisoner
Ay chain her up
In her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn
Tootles she cried I appeal to you
Was it not strange She appealed to Tootles quite the silliest one
Grandly however did Tootles respond For that one moment he
dropped his silliness and spoke with dignity
I am just Tootles he said and nobody minds me But the first
who does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will
blood him severely
He drew back his hanger and for that instant his sun was at noon
The others held back uneasily Then Peter returned and they saw at
once that they would get no support from him He would keep no girl
in the Neverland against her will
Wendy he said striding up and down I have asked the
redskins to guide you through the wood as flying tires you so
Thank you Peter
Then he continued in the short sharp voice of one accustomed
to be obeyed Tinker Bell will take you across the sea Wake her
Nibs
Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer though Tink had
really been sitting up in bed listening for some time
Who are you How dare you Go away she cried
You are to get up Tink Nibs called and take Wendy on a
journey
Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going
but she was jolly well determined not to be her courier and she said
so in still more offensive language Then she pretended to be asleep
again
She says she wont Nibs exclaimed aghast at such
insubordination whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young
ladys chamber
Tink he rapped out if you dont get up and dress at once I will
open the curtains and then we shall all see you in your neglige
This made her leap to the floor Who said I wasnt getting up
she cried
In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy
now equipped with John and Michael for the journey By this time
they were dejected not merely because they were about to lose her
but also because they felt that she was going off to something nice to
which they had not been invited Novelty was beckoning to them as
usual
Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted
