There were no wolves living near Mr Baggins hole at home but he knew
that noise He had had it described to him often enough in tales One of his elder
cousins on the Took side who had been a great traveller used to imitate it to
frighten him To hear it out in the forest under the moon was too much for Bilbo
Even magic rings are not much use against wolvesespecially against the evil
packs that lived under the shadow of the goblininfested mountains over the
Edge of the Wild on the borders of the unknown Wolves of that sort smell
keener than goblins and do not need to see you to catch you
What shall we do what shall we do he cried Escaping goblins to be
caught by wolves he said and it became a proverb though we now say out of
the fryingpan into the fire in the same sort of uncomfortable situations
Up the trees quick cried Gandalf and they ran to the trees at the edge of
the glade hunting for those that had branches fairly low or were slender enough
to swarm up They found them as quick as ever they could you can guess and
up they went as high as ever they could trust the branches You would have
laughed from a safe distance if you had seen the dwarves sitting up in the trees
with their beards dangling down like old gentlemen gone cracked and playing at
being boys Fili and Kili were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous
Christmas tree Dori Nori Ori Oin and Gloin were more comfortable in a huge
pine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes of a wheel
Bifur Bofur Bombur and Thorin were in another Dwalin and Balin had
swarmed up a tall slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to
sit in the greenery of the topmost boughs Gandalf who was a good deal taller
than the others had found a tree into which they could not climb a large pine
standing at the very edge of the glade He was quite hidden in its boughs but
you could see his eyes gleaming in the moon as he peeped out
And Bilbo He could not get into any tree and was scuttling about from
trunk to trunk like a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog after it
Youve left the burglar behind again said Nori to Dori looking down
I cant be always carrying burglars on my back said Dori down tunnels
and up trees What do you think I am A porter
Hell be eaten if we dont do something said Thorin for there were howls
all round them now getting nearer and nearer Dori he called for Dori was
lowest down in the easiest tree be quick and give Mr Baggins a hand up
Dori was really a decent fellow in spite of his grumbling Poor Bilbo could
not reach his hand even when he climbed down to the bottom branch and hung
his arm down as far as ever he could So Dori actually climbed out of the tree
