    And Balin and Dwalin
        down into the valley
            in June
                ha ha
O Will you be staying
Or will you be flying
Your ponies are straying
The daylight is dying
To fly would be folly
To stay would be jolly
    And listen and hark
        Till the end of the dark
            to our tune
                ha ha
So they laughed and sang in the trees and pretty fair nonsense I daresay you
think it Not that they would care they would only laugh all the more if you told
them so They were elves of course Soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as the
darkness deepened He loved elves though he seldom met them but he was a
little frightened of them too Dwarves dont get on well with them Even decent
enough dwarves like Thorin and his friends think them foolish which is a very
foolish thing to think or get annoyed with them For some elves tease them and
laugh at them and most of all at their beards
Well well said a voice Just look Bilbo the hobbit on a pony my dear
Isnt it delicious
Most astonishing wonderful
Then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written
down in full At last one a tall young fellow came out from the trees and bowed
to Gandalf and to Thorin
Welcome to the valley he said
Thank you said Thorin a bit gruffly but Gandalf was already off his horse
and among the elves talking merrily with them
You are a little out of your way said the elf that is if you are making for
the only path across the water and to the house beyond We will set you right
but you had best get on foot until you are over the bridge Are you going to stay
