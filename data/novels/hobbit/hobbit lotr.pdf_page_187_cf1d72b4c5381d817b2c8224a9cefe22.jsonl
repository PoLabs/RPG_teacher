Chapter XIII
NOT AT HOME
In the meanwhile the dwarves sat in darkness and utter silence fell about them
Little they ate and little they spoke They could not count the passing of time
and they scarcely dared to move for the whisper of their voices echoed and
rustled in the tunnel If they dozed they woke still to darkness and to silence
going on unbroken At last after days and days of waiting as it seemed when
they were becoming choked and dazed for want of air they could bear it no
longer They would almost have welcomed sounds from below of the dragons
return In the silence they feared some cunning devilry of his but they could not
sit there for ever
Thorin spoke Let us try the door he said I must feel the wind on my face
soon or die I think I would rather be smashed by Smaug in the open than
suffocate in here So several of the dwarves got up and groped back to where
the door had been But they found that the upper end of the tunnel had been
shattered and blocked with broken rock Neither key nor the magic it had once
obeyed would ever open that door again
We are trapped they groaned This is the end We shall die here
But somehow just when the dwarves were most despairing Bilbo felt a
strange lightening of the heart as if a heavy weight had gone from under his
waistcoat
Come come he said While theres life theres hope as my father used
to say and Third time pays for all I am going down the tunnel once again I
have been that way twice when I knew there was a dragon at the other end so I
will risk a third visit when I am no longer sure Anyway the only way out is
down And I think this time you had better all come with me
In desperation they agreed and Thorin was the first to go forward by Bilbos
