guess there is a closed door which has been made to look exactly like the side of
the Mountain That is the usual dwarves methodI think that is right isnt it
Quite right said Thorin
Also went on Gandalf I forgot to mention that with the map went a key a
small and curious key Here it is he said and handed to Thorin a key with a
