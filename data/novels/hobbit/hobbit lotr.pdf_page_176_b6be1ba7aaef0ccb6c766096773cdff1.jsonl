Those were perhaps the worst moments they had been through yet The
horrible sounds of Smaugs anger were echoing in the stony hollows far above
at any moment he might come blazing down or fly whirling round and find them
there near the perilous cliffs edge hauling madly on the ropes Up came Bofur
and still all was safe Up came Bombur puffing and blowing while the ropes
