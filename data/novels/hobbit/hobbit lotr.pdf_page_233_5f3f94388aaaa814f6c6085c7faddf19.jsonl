Chapter XIX
THE LAST STAGE
It was on May the First that the two came back at last to the brink of the valley
of Rivendell where stood the Last or the First Homely House Again it was
evening their ponies were tired especially the one that carried the baggage and
they all felt in need of rest As they rode down the steep path Bilbo heard the
elves still singing in the trees as if they had not stopped since he left and as
soon as the riders came down into the lower glades of the wood they burst into a
song of much the same kind as before This is something like it
The dragon is withered
His bones are now crumbled
His armour is shivered
His splendour is humbled
Though sword shall be rusted
And throne and crown perish
With strength that men trusted
And wealth that they cherish
Here grass is still growing
And leaves are yet swinging
The white water flowing
And elves are yet singing
    Come Tralalalally
    Come back to the valley
The stars are far brighter
