they took it in turn to carry him on their backs
Still goblins go faster than dwarves and these goblins knew the way better
they had made the paths themselves and were madly angry so that do what
they could the dwarves heard the cries and howls getting closer and closer Soon
they could hear even the flap of the goblin feet many many feet which seemed
only just round the last corner The blink of red torches could be seen behind
them in the tunnel they were following and they were getting deadly tired
Why O why did I ever leave my hobbithole said poor Mr Baggins
bumping up and down on Bomburs back
Why O why did I ever bring a wretched little hobbit on a treasure hunt
said poor Bombur who was fat and staggered along with the sweat dripping
down his nose in his heat and terror
At this point Gandalf fell behind and Thorin with him They turned a sharp
corner About turn he shouted Draw your sword Thorin
There was nothing else to be done and the goblins did not like it They came
scurrying round the corner in full cry and found Goblincleaver and Foe
hammer shining cold and bright right in their astonished eyes The ones in front
dropped their torches and gave one yell before they were killed The ones behind
yelled still more and leaped back knocking over those that were running after
them Biter and Beater they shrieked and soon they were all in confusion
and most of them were hustling back the way they had come
It was quite a long while before any of them dared to turn that corner By that
time the dwarves had gone on again a long long way on into the dark tunnels
of the goblins realm When the goblins discovered that they put out their
torches and they slipped on soft shoes and they chose out their very quickest
runners with the sharpest ears and eyes These ran forward as swift as weasels in
the dark and with hardly any more noise than bats
That is why neither Bilbo nor the dwarves nor even Gandalf heard them
coming Nor did they see them But they were seen by the goblins that ran
silently up behind for Gandalf was letting his wand give out a faint light to help
the dwarves as they went along
Quite suddenly Dori now at the back again carrying Bilbo was grabbed from
behind in the dark He shouted and fell and the hobbit rolled off his shoulders
into the blackness bumped his head on hard rock and remembered nothing
more
