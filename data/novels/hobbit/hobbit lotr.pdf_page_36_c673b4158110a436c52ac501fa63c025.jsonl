Then there was a gorgeous row Bilbo had just enough wits left when Bert
dropped him on the ground to scramble out of the way of their feet before they
were fighting like dogs and calling one another all sorts of perfectly true and
applicable names in very loud voices Soon they were locked in one anothers
arms and rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping while Tom whacked
at them both with a branch to bring them to their sensesand that of course only
made them madder than ever
That would have been the time for Bilbo to have left But his poor little feet
had been very squashed in Berts big paw and he had no breath in his body and
his head was going round so there he lay for a while panting just outside the
circle of firelight
Right in the middle of the fight up came Balin The dwarves had heard noises
from a distance and after waiting for some time for Bilbo to come back or to
hoot like an owl they started off one by one to creep towards the light as quietly
as they could No sooner did Tom see Balin come into the light than he gave an
awful howl Trolls simply detest the very sight of dwarves uncooked Bert and
Bill stopped fighting immediately and a sack Tom quick they said Before
Balin who was wondering where in all this commotion Bilbo was knew what
was happening a sack was over his head and he was down
Theres more to come yet said Tom or Im mighty mistook Lots and
none at all it is said he No burrahobbits but lots of these here dwarves
Thats about the shape of it
I reckon youre right said Bert and wed best get out of the light
And so they did With sacks in their hands that they used for carrying off
mutton and other plunder they waited in the shadows As each dwarf came up
and looked at the fire and the spilled jugs and the gnawed mutton in surprise
pop went a nasty smelly sack over his head and he was down Soon Dwalin lay
by Balin and Fili and Kili together and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap and
Oin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the
fire
Thatll teach em said Tom for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of
trouble and fought like mad as dwarves will when cornered
Thorin came lastand he was not caught unawares He came expecting
mischief and didnt need to see his friends legs sticking out of sacks to tell him
that things were not all well He stood outside in the shadows some way off and
said Whats all this trouble Who has been knocking my people about
