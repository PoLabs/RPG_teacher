Chapter V
RIDDLES IN THE DARK
When Bilbo opened his eyes he wondered if he had for it was just as dark as
with them shut No one was anywhere near him Just imagine his fright He
could hear nothing see nothing and he could feel nothing except the stone of the
floor
Very slowly he got up and groped about on all fours till he touched the wall
of the tunnel but neither up nor down it could he find anything nothing at all
no sign of goblins no sign of dwarves His head was swimming and he was far
from certain even of the direction they had been going in when he had his fall
He guessed as well as he could and crawled along for a good way till suddenly
his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the
tunnel It was a turning point in his career but he did not know it He put the ring
in his pocket almost without thinking certainly it did not seem of any particular
use at the moment He did not go much further but sat down on the cold floor
and gave himself up to complete miserableness for a long while He thought of
himself frying bacon and eggs in his own kitchen at homefor he could feel
inside that it was high time for some meal or other but that only made him
miserabler
He could not think what to do nor could he think what had happened or why
he had been left behind or why if he had been left behind the goblins had not
caught him or even why his head was so sore The truth was he had been lying
quiet out of sight and out of mind in a very dark corner for a long while
After some time he felt for his pipe It was not broken and that was
something Then he felt for his pouch and there was some tobacco in it and that
was something more Then he felt for matches and he could not find any at all
and that shattered his hopes completely Just as well for him as he agreed when
