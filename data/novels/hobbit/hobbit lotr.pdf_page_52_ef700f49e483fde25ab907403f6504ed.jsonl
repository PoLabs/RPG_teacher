moon of Autumnand perhaps it will be Durins Day they had said Only
Gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing Dwarves had not passed that way
for many years but Gandalf had and he knew how evil and danger had grown
and thriven in the Wild since the dragons had driven men from the lands and
the goblins had spread in secret after the battle of the Mines of Moria Even the
good plans of wise wizards like Gandalf and of good friends like Elrond go
astray sometimes when you are off on dangerous adventures over the Edge of the
Wild and Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know it
He knew that something unexpected might happen and he hardly dared to hope
that they would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains
with lonely peaks and valleys where no king ruled They did not All was well
until one day they met a thunderstormmore than a thunderstorm a thunder
battle You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the land
and in a rivervalley especially at times when two great thunderstorms meet and
clash More terrible still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at night
when storms come up from East and West and make war The lightning splinters
on the peaks and rocks shiver and great crashes split the air and go rolling and
tumbling into every cave and hollow and the darkness is filled with
overwhelming noise and sudden light
Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind They were high up in
a narrow place with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them There
they were sheltering under a hanging rock for the night and he lay beneath a
blanket and shook from head to toe When he peeped out in the lightning
flashes he saw that across the valley the stonegiants were out and were hurling
rocks at one another for a game and catching them and tossing them down into
the darkness where they smashed among the trees far below or splintered into
little bits with a bang Then came a wind and a rain and the wind whipped the
rain and the hail about in every direction so that an overhanging rock was no
protection at all Soon they were getting drenched and their ponies were standing
with their heads down and their tails between their legs and some of them were
whinnying with fright They could hear the giants guffawing and shouting all
over the mountainsides
This wont do at all said Thorin If we dont get blown off or drowned
or struck by lightning we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked skyhigh
for a football
