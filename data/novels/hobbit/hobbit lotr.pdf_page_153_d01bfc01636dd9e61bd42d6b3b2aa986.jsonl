rains had swollen the waters that flowed east and there had been an earthquake
or two which some were inclined to attribute to the dragonalluding to him
chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod in the direction of the Mountain The
marshes and bogs had spread wider and wider on either side Paths had vanished
and many a rider and wanderer too if they had tried to find the lost ways across
The elfroad through the wood which the dwarves had followed on the advice of
Beorn now came to a doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the
forest only the river offered any longer a safe way from the skirts of Mirkwood
in the North to the mountainshadowed plains beyond and the river was guarded
by the Woodelves king
So you see Bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good It
might have been some comfort to Mr Baggins shivering on the barrels if he had
known that news of this had reached Gandalf far away and given him great
anxiety and that he was in fact finishing his other business which does not

had never imagined that any water that was not the sea could look so big It was
so wide that the opposite shores looked small and far but it was so long that its
northerly end which pointed towards the Mountain could not be seen at all
Only from the map did Bilbo know that away up there where the stars of the
Wain were already twinkling the Running River came down into the lake from
Dale and with the Forest River filled with deep waters what must once have been
a great deep rocky valley At the southern end the doubled waters poured out
again over high waterfalls and ran away hurriedly to unknown lands In the still
evening air the noise of the falls could be heard like a distant roar
Not far from the mouth of the Forest River was the strange town he heard the
elves speak of in the kings cellars It was not built on the shore though there
