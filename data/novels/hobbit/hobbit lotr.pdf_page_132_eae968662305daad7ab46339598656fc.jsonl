most of them very shaky and little use on their legs There they were at last
twelve of them counting poor old Bombur who was being propped up on either
side by his cousin Bifur and his brother Bofur and Bilbo was dancing about and
waving his Sting and hundreds of angry spiders were goggling at them all round
and about and above It looked pretty hopeless
Then the battle began Some of the dwarves had knives and some had sticks
and all of them could get at stones and Bilbo had his elvish dagger Again and
again the spiders were beaten off and many of them were killed But it could not
go on for long Bilbo was nearly tired out only four of the dwarves were able to
stand firmly and soon they would all be overpowered like weary flies Already
the spiders were beginning to weave their webs all round them again from tree to
tree
In the end Bilbo could think of no plan except to let the dwarves into the
secret of his ring He was rather sorry about it but it could not be helped
I am going to disappear he said I shall draw the spiders off if I can and
you must keep together and make in the opposite direction To the left there that
is more or less the way towards the place where we last saw the elffires
It was difficult to get them to understand what with their dizzy heads and
the shouts and the whacking of sticks and the throwing of stones but at last
Bilbo felt he could delay no longerthe spiders were drawing their circle ever
closer He suddenly slipped on his ring and to the great astonishment of the
dwarves he vanished
Soon there came the sound of Lazy Lob and Attercop from among the
trees away on the right That upset the spiders greatly They stopped advancing
and some went off in the direction of the voice Attercop made them so angry
that they lost their wits Then Balin who had grasped Bilbos plan better than the
rest led an attack The dwarves huddled together in a knot and sending a
shower of stones they drove at the spiders on the left and burst through the ring
Away behind them now the shouting and singing suddenly stopped
Hoping desperately that Bilbo had not been caught the dwarves went on Not
fast enough though They were sick and weary and they could not go much
better than a hobble and a wobble though many of the spiders were close
behind Every now and then they had to turn and fight the creatures that were
overtaking them and already some spiders were in the trees above them and
throwing down their long clinging threads
Things were looking pretty bad again when suddenly Bilbo reappeared and
charged into the astonished spiders unexpectedly from the side
