Out they went under the overhanging branches of the trees on either bank Bilbo
wondered what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was getting
into their tubs Some of those that bobbed along by him in the gloom seemed
pretty low in the water and he guessed that these had dwarves inside
I do hope I put the lids on tight enough he thought but before long he was
worrying too much about himself to remember the dwarves He managed to keep
his head above the water but he was shivering with the cold and he wondered if
he would die of it before the luck turned and how much longer he would be able
to hang on and whether he should risk the chance of letting go and trying to
swim to the bank
The luck turned all right before long the eddying current carried several
barrels close ashore at one point and there for a while they stuck against some
hidden root Then Bilbo took the opportunity of scrambling up the side of his
barrel while it was held steady against another Up he crawled like a drowned
rat and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best he could The
breeze was cold but better than the water and he hoped he would not suddenly
roll off again when they started off once more
Before long the barrels broke free again and turned and twisted off down the
stream and out into the main current Then he found it quite as difficult to stick
on as he had feared but he managed it somehow though it was miserably
uncomfortable Luckily he was very light and the barrel was a good big one and
being rather leaky had now shipped a small amount of water All the same it was
like trying to ride without bridle or stirrups a roundbellied pony that was
always thinking of rolling on the grass
In this way at last Mr Baggins came to a place where the trees on either hand
grew thinner He could see the paler sky between them The dark river opened
suddenly wide and there it was joined to the main water of the Forest River
flowing down in haste from the kings great doors There was a dim sheet of
water no longer overshadowed and on its sliding surface there were dancing and
broken reflections of clouds and of stars Then the hurrying water of the Forest
River swept all the company of casks and tubs away to the north bank in which
it had eaten out a wide bay This had a shingly shore under hanging banks and
was walled at the eastern end by a little jutting cape of hard rock On the shallow
shore most of the barrels ran aground though a few went on to bump against the
stony pier
There were people on the lookout on the banks They quickly poled and
pushed all the barrels together into the shallows and when they had counted
