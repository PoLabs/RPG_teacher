colours and set dancing up by the roof to amuse them They talked and talked
and forgot about the storm and discussed what each would do with his share of
the treasure when they got it which at the moment did not seem so impossible
and so they dropped off to sleep one by one And that was the last time that they
used the ponies packages baggages tools and paraphernalia that they had
brought with them
It turned out a good thing that night that they had brought little Bilbo with
them after all For somehow he could not go to sleep for a long while and
when he did sleep he had very nasty dreams He dreamed that a crack in the
wall at the back of the cave got bigger and bigger and opened wider and wider
