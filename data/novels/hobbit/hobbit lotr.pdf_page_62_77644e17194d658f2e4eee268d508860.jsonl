he came to his senses Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the
smell of tobacco would have brought on him out of dark holes in that horrible
place Still at the moment he felt very crushed But in slapping all his pockets
and feeling all round himself for matches his hand came on the hilt of his little
swordthe little dagger that he got from the trolls and that he had quite
forgotten nor fortunately had the goblins noticed it as he wore it inside his
breeches
Now he drew it out It shone pale and dim before his eyes So it is an elvish

But somehow he was comforted It was rather splendid to be wearing a blade

pretty steadily and keeping in the same direction in spite of a twist and a turn or
two There were passages leading off to the side every now and then as he knew
by the glimmer of his sword or could feel with his hand on the wall Of these he
took no notice except to hurry past for fear of goblins or halfimagined dark
things coming out of them On and on he went and down and down and still he
