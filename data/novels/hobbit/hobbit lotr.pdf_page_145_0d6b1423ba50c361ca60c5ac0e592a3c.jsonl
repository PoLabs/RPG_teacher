hold of the keys again even if I feel inclined to try
That was too much for them and they calmed down In the end of course
they had to do just what Bilbo suggested because it was obviously impossible
for them to try and find their way into the upper halls or to fight their way out of
gates that closed by magic and it was no good grumbling in the passages until
they were caught again So following the hobbit down into the lowest cellars
they crept They passed a door through which the chief guard and the butler
could be seen still happily snoring with smiles upon their faces The wine of
Dorwinion brings deep and pleasant dreams There would be a different

they went on stole in and kindheartedly put the keys back on his belt
That will save him some of the trouble he is in for said Mr Baggins to

shaking and the bumping they would get inside though Bilbo did his best to find
straw and other stuff to pack them in as cosily as could be managed in a short
time At last twelve dwarves were stowed Thorin had given a lot of trouble and
turned and twisted in his tub and grumbled like a large dog in a small kennel
while Balin who came last made a great fuss about his airholes and said he was
stifling even before his lid was on Bilbo had done what he could to close holes
