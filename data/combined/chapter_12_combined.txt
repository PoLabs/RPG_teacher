Inside Information

**Fantasy Chapter Summary:**
Bilbo enters the mountain and steals a golden cup while Smaug sleeps. The dragon awakes and flies around the mountain, but the companions hide while Smaug chases their ponies away. Bilbo returns to the dragon's lair using his ring, but Smaug questions Bilbo. He answers only in riddles, flatters Smaug, notices an opening in its armor, and rushes back to the passage where his companions are, telling them what he saw while a thrush seems to listen. The dragon roars, they shut the door to the passage, and an avalanche traps them.

CONTENT CREATION: VIDEO

**Textbook Chapter Summary:**
Video has become an integral part of the online world. The potential for exposure  as well as interaction  is massive and brands that fail to capitalise on this  risk being left behind as competitors build thriving communities.    As with most content  it is up to the brand to decide how to represent its video content. Videos can be hosted on popular video-sharing websites to capitalise on already existing audiences and developed interfaces  or on bespoke websites that allow for free reign in customisation.   Brands should then aim to optimise their videos on the chosen platforms to increase their visibility on search engines. Creating a healthy community is also important in increasing exposure. Very rarely  if ever  does an audience come to video content without input from the creators. On top of optimising for search and other tweaks  brands should upload content regularly or risk losing any ground gained.    Social media should be considered as its platforms allow for the sharing of content  and commentary. Overall  brands should be aware that there is no quick fix for video. It requires planning and investment  as well as long-term commitment to creating brand advocates.
