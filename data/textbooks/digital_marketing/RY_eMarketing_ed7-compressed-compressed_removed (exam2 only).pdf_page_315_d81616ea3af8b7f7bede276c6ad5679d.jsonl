ANALYSING
2143 Designing for analysis
The purpose of running tests is to improve performance To do this you analyse your results 
against what you expected to find and then choose the option that performed better This 
sounds simple but how do you know what counts as better enough to warrant a change Is 
it one more click than the other option three more clicks or should one perform 25 better 
than the other You also need to think about chance how certain are you that the differences 
in your results were not just coincidental These can be tricky questions to answer
To determine which option in your split test did 
better set parameters and assess the statistical 
significance of your results In statistics we 
create a null hypothesis For split tests the 
null hypothesis is that there is no difference 
between the performance of the two options 
and any difference recorded is due to chance 
You then use statistics to calculate the p value 
which shows whether the difference was likely due to chance or not If the difference is sig
nificant it is probably not due to chance Generally to be significant the p value should be less 
than or equal to 005 indicating a less than 5 probability that the difference in performance 
between the two options was due to chance
However dont worry you do not have to be able to perform complex statistical calculations 
Handy tools like VWOs split test significance calculator will do this for you All you have to do 
is enter the number of users that visited your control version and the number of conversions 
as well as the number of users that visited the variation and the number that converted The 
calculator then provides your p value and states whether your test is significant enough to change 
to the variation You can find the calculator here vwocomabsplittestsignificancecalculator 
When designing your tests it is important to consider the null hypothesis and set the parameters 
for significance By keeping these aspects in mind you will develop tests that allow for clearer 
and easier analysis which will make the whole testing process that much more effective
215 STEPBYSTEP GUIDE TO CONVERSION OPTIMISATION
Proper planning is important to achieving 
success with your conversion optimisation 
Whatever the outcome of your test if youve 
planned and documented carefully youll 
always learn something Think about what is 
bringing visitors to your site what persuaded 
them to act and most importantly what caused 
them to abandon your site
The pvalue is defined as the probability 
of getting results at least as extreme as 
the ones you observed given that the 
null hypothesis is correct where the 
null hypothesis in AB testing is that the 
variant and the control are the same
NOTE
You already know that conversion 
optimisation is the practice of increasing 
the percentage of users who perform 
a desired action on a website Read
