ANALYSING
when consumers buy more from you As your testing becomes more sophisticated you will 
hopefully be achieving both 
On product pages you should be testing to see how you might encourage users to start the 
purchasing process Here are a few things to test 
	
Images Images of different sizes or entirely different image contentcould make a big 
difference
	
Call to action Seeing the words Add to cart or Buy now may affect shopper behaviour
	
Shipping information Test to see whether displaying shipping costs before actual checkout 
affects the volume of customers starting the checkout process as well as its effect on 
completing the purchase
	
Credibility information Do Secure shopping badges affect conversion rate 
Product pages are also a good place to test how you might increase basket size You can test 
displaying complementary or similar products If you spend time on Amazon youll see that 
they display items that other customers bought togethersuggesting you should do the same 
The checkout process is incredibly important to test Often an online purchase takes place 
over several screens or steps Instead of looking at the overall conversion rate you should be 
looking at the conversion rate between steps This is referred to as funnel analysis 
If possible you should test a singlepage checkout versus the multipage approach Also test 
credibility and reassurance statements and how these affect the checkout process Even font 
size can have an effect on conversions 
The above should give you an idea of where you can start with your conversion optimisation 
but it is by no means an exhaustive list 
214 DESIGNING TESTS
To design tests successfully you need to know what you can test how you can test and 
what sort of time periods you are looking at for testing If its your first time doing conversion 
optimisation you should start with simple and quick tests to get a feel for the process before 
embarking on more complicated tests 
2141 Types of tests
When we talk about conversion rate optimis
ation we are usually referring to running split 
tests A split test is one where we show different 
versions of a web page to groups of users and 
determine which one has performed better 
The Facebook split test feature allows 
you to test different audiences against 
each other to discover which ones 
deliver the best results based on the 
campaign goal
