The future of advertising
For customers
If youre a Netflix subscriber you would have received a message from them that says We just 
added a movie you might like With this level of personalisation Netflix is invested in getting 
to know their customers and their viewing habits better 
Customers have come to expect and to a certain degree demand personalisation from the 
brands they interact with Customers know that they dont have to accept experiences that do 
not meet their expectations 
According to Accenture 91 of consumers said they are more likely to shop with brands that 
provide offers and recommendations that are relevant to them 
Personalised experience makes a customer feel understood such as
	
When a streaming service like Amazon or Netflix offers recommendations based on 
previous viewing activity or sends reminders that the viewer left in the middle of a movie
	
When a customer receives a reminder that they havent completed a purchase on an 
ecommerce site
These brands make use of recommender systems to enhance the customers sense of per
sonalisation The systems suggest content based on a set of algorithms and use a customers 
past viewing or shopping habits to package and present recommendations that may lead to 
the next action such as watching the next movie In this case the viewer feels as though the 
company understands their wants and needs resulting in a personalised customer experience
For organisations 
Customer experience has become a key differentiating factor for companies Personalisation 
allows organisations to have more meaningful interactions with their audience and makes the 
customers decision to purchase easier
Consumers receive masses of marketing messages every day To stand out against the 
competition brands need to increase engagement and businesses need to break through the 
noise that distracts their customers from their messages Generic messages are simply not 
effective and the less relevant a marketing campaign is to a customer the lower the response 
rates will be
AI and personalisation
AI affects personalisation in a variety of ways in customer experience and marketing Brands 
that are not incorporating tactics or approaches to address personalisation risk losing their 
positioning in the market against their competition
Consider these five ways that AI affects personalisation when preparing for the future of 
advertising
