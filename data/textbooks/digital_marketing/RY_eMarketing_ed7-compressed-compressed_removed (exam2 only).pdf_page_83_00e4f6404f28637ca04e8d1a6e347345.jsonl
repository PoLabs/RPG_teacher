Facebook Marketplace
Facebook Marketplace was introduced in 2007 giving users the option to post classified ads 
It was removed in 2014 because it didnt gain enough traction In 2017 Facebook reintroduced 
Marketplace with much higher prominence placing it closer to the top on the desktop site 
and mobile app Initially a customertocustomer platform Marketplace started taking off as 
a business to customer platform in 2019 
Sellers list their products and buyers make contact to purchase negotiate or inquire about 
the product It acts as a site for sellers to connect with buyers and viceversa There are no 
transaction gateways to make payments on Facebook Marketplace because it does not support 
payment processing Primarily Marketplace allows you to list find and advertise products with 
a price whether you are an individual seller or manufacturer
If you are trying to decide which one to use Facebook Marketplace or Facebook Shop 
consider both because if you have a Facebook Shop you can add Marketplace as a sales 
channel and reach more people who are in search of specific items and shopping there 
You also dont pay any seller fees on Facebook In this regard theres no difference between 
Facebook Shops and Facebook Marketplace You can set up a Shop with checkout on 
Facebook which allows you to choose how you want to accept payment Learn more
