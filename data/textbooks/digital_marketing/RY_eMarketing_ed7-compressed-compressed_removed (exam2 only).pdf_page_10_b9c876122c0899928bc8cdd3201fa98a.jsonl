742 Development options 
When selecting how to proceed with your website development you have a few options at 
your disposal The choice between an offtheshelf solution and bespoke development comes 
down to how flexible the offtheshelf solution is If too much customisation is required or 
it does not support the businesss requirements it may be better and cheaper to develop a 
bespoke solution
Offtheshelf solution 
The CMS you choose can be prebuilt by an external company or developer This can be bought 
like any other software on the market While this option may provide fewer custom features 
its potentially a more costeffective option than a bespoke CMS It is certainly quicker if little 
customisation is required
Bespoke development 
This involves a CMS that is built specifically for a certain website This option is highly tailored 
and customised to your website and can be more expensive than other options It is possibly 
less future proof as finding alternative agencies to support custombuilt code is challenging
