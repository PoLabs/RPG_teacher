Explorations
The second button on the navigation panel is Explorations This is a set of advanced techniques 
that go further than standard reports to help you find out more about your customers behaviour 
Under Explorations you can access data and analytical techniques that you cant find in reports
An exploration consists of three sections  The large area on the right that shows your data 
using the selected technique is called the canvas It can have multiple tabs which allows you 
to use multiple techniques in a single exploration The default technique for a blank exploration 
is the freeform table Lets look at the techniques on offer
	
Freeform exploration sets out your data in a crosstab layout You can use different visual
isations such as bar charts pie charts line charts scatter plots and geo maps 
	
Cohort exploration gathers data about the behaviour of users that share common attributes 
	
Funnel exploration visualises the users steps necessary to complete a task on your site or 
app so that you can see how to optimise user experience
	
Segment overlap exploration shows how different user segments relate to each other It 
can be used to identify new segments with complex criteria
	
User exploration looks at the users that make up segments Using this you can find extra 
information on individual user behaviour and activities 
	
User lifetime exploration compiles user behaviour over their lifetime as a customer

access the dimensions metrics and segments 
you can use You can also adjust the timeframe 
here The Tab settings panel lets you configure 
the currently selected tab First select the 
technique then add items from the Variables panel and finally configure the Tab settings

analyse Metrics give you the numbers 
for your exploration Segments are 
subsets of users
