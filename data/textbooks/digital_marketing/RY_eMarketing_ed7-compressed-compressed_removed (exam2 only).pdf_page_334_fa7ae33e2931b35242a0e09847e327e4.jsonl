The future of advertising
Augmented reality 
Augmented Reality AR is an enhanced version of the physical world that makes use of 
overlaying digital visual elements sound or other sensory stimuli to improve the users 
experience Brands make use of augmented reality to promote their products or services launch 
marketing campaigns and collect unique user data While VR creates its own environment 
AR adds to the existing world
Similar to VR ARbased adverts can also be used to deliver interactive advertising experiences 
With the use of the internet and digital platforms like apps marketers can connect with potential 
customers using technology that allows customers to try out products from wherever they are 
LOral for example has partnered with YouCam Makeup by Perfect Corp to augment a 
makeup tryon tool using their app The makeover tool allows the user to try on hair colour 
foundation lipstick mascara and blush for a realistic view of what it will look like before 
making the purchase This convenience gives their customers the freedom to try on a variety 
of options without commitment The engagement gives the brand the opportunity to get to 
know how the functions are used allowing them to get to know the user and their behaviour 
AR is used widely thanks to its availability from filters on Instagram and Snapchat to TikTok 
addons Brands have been making use of AR functions to create awareness and run promotions 
to help customers decide before making their purchase

decide on a purchase without ever entering a store
