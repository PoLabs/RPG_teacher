According to Zuckerberg the metaverse will 
be a new platform that could connect to 
different apps and allow users to bring items 
and data across different virtual spaces or even 
project them into the physical world through 
augmented reality In other words products can 
be used all across the metaverse instead of only on one app or one platform You can read

This move however is still in the making and the technology does not yet fully exist It will 
take time for the business to garner support for early adopters and to refine the technical 
challenges That said it shows the forwardthinking nature of the business to plan for future 
developments and adopt future trends
