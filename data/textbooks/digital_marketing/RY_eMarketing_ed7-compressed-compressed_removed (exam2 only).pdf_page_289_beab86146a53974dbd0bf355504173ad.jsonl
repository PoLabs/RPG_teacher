Differences between Reports and Explorations
Reports and Explorations may seem similar 
since they both provide insights that can lead 
to action Usually the data will be the same in 
both Reports and Explorations but sometimes 
they are different Typically when they differ 
Explorations tend to be more accurate That 
happens for the following reasons
1	 Support different fields These two parts of GA4 give you different views at different levels 
of granularity The same dimensions and metrics may not be supported in both 
2	 Segments and comparisons differences Comparisons from Reports are converted to 
segments in Explorations and any of those that are not supported will be dropped 
3	 Date differences If you create a report with a date range outside your settings all other 
data outside of that will be eliminated 
4	 Amount of data If a property is collecting a lot of data Analytics can use different meth
odologies between the two which can cause inconsistencies 
5	 Processing time differences Since data comes from multiple different systems you may 
notice differences over 48 hours 
Advertising
The third button on the navigation panel is Advertising These reports look slightly different to 
the others Currently there are three types of reports you can access
1	 Advertising snapshot which summarises the business metrics
2	 Model comparison which compares how different attribution models impact the value of 
marketing channels
3	 Conversion paths which show the paths customers take to conversion as well as how 
different attribution models can credit those paths
