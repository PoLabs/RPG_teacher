CREATING
1244 Choosing and uploading to platform 
Once you have the video you need to decide where you will have it uploaded There are two 
options for making your video content available online These are not mutually exclusive and 
there are techniques for both to ensure the best distribution and search coverage for your 
video For example you could be embedding videos posted elsewhere on your site or on social 
media which is where a massive amount of video is being consumed 
Online video can be hosted on your own site or it can be posted to one or many video distri
bution channels If you post your video somewhere such as YouTube or Vimeo it is then easy 
to embed it into your website as well 
The main advantage of posting a video to a thirdparty site is the opportunity to quickly exploit 
an already existing audience These websites also usually have a builtin social and viral media 
aspect to their user experience Videosharing sites tend to have simplified algorithms which 
are easier to take advantage of leading to more rapid universal search exposure 
Many thirdparty video hosting options exist Shortform video platforms like TikTok Instagram 
Reels and Snapchat have emerged to challenge existing industry giants like YouTube and 
increasingly Facebook 
To gain the most views for your videos you need to find out where your audience is consuming 
video Once you discover the platform of their choice create videos for those specific platforms 
and post them accordingly
As mentioned in the planning and conceptualising bullet you should brand your channel Many 
platforms encourage adding a logo branded elements a brand description and links to your 
other web properties You can customise your page as you see fit Some platforms also have 
a range of analytical features for you to measure engagement and as an added bonus they 
work well on mobile devices too Using YouTube can help you gain many benefits in ranking 
well on the worlds most popular search engine Google 
A few more good options for free video hosting include

If your video is hosted on your own website the obvious advantage is that you have control 
over the whole website and the environment in which it is hosted from the look and feel to 
onpage text metadata and user experience 
When it comes to advertising and related content you control both and you decide how to 
monetise it
