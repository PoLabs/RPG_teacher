13152 Marketing to content consumers 
Social media allows anyone to have a say the same tools that are available to individuals are 
available to companies Company blogs allow a brand to build an online personality and to 
interact with their target market Entertainment created and spread via social media increases 
brand touchpoints Using the same channels that are available to your consumer aids in 
understanding them and levels the plane of conversation 
When using social media to reach out to content consumers go to where they are The media 
you use is dictated by your users For example a nightclub for students can create a Facebook 
Page to advertise its weekly specials and interact with fans while Land Rover enthusiasts may 
prefer to engage on a discussion forum 
With all interactions marketing messages need to be clearly identified and labelled with a 
disclaimer added if necessary Trying to hide them as something else will only decrease your 
authenticity and probably your following 
13153 Marketing to content sharers 
Content sharers are content consumers who also pass your message on whether its by 
chat or email by sharing a link on a blog or by submitting your content to a bookmarking or 
aggregating service They are a crucial link in the chain that passes your message around 
Make it as easy as possible to share your content by making the post shareable using unique 
and easytoread URLs

While marketers can use the tools of social media to convey their message the characteristics 
that define a social media platform are also important Social media allows users to express 
themselves and this means that rich demographic and psychographic information can be 
compiled for more useful and targeted advertising This presents many opportunities for finding 
creative ways to reach an advertfatigued demographic It also introduces the risk of dealing with 
personal information so make sure youre up to speed with the relevant laws in your country 
1316 ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES 
People are finding it easier to switch off or ignore traditional advertisingparticularly through 
traditional media channels such as TV or radio Social media gives brands the opportunity to 
interact with customers through relevant and targeted communications that customers can 
choose to engage with on their terms For example a consumer may visit a branded YouTube 
channel as opposed to deliberately ignoring advert breaks on television 
Social medias potential shareability can be one of its greatest benefits if users like your 
content enough they may share it with their own communities This is increasingly rare and 
difficult to engineer
