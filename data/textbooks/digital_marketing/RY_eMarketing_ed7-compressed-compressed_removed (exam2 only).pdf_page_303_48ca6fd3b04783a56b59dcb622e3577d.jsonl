beneficial to the company The company estimated that its algorithm generated 1 billion 
in value every year largely due to customer retention

Amazon Prime Netflix had an impressive 90 retention rate meaning the vast majority 
of viewers continued to subscribe to the service month after month In contrast Amazon 
Primes retention rate was 75 and Hulus was 64
For Netflix customer retention meant more than happy viewers It also meant more data 
a continually improving algorithm and substantial business growth
Netflix emerged as the worlds most highly valued company with a total valuation of over 
160 billion Netflix could continue to increase this valuation by leveraging its data and 
producing original media and by recommending the ideal content to viewers every time 
they access the streaming platform
