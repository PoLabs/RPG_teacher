The future of advertising
1	 Research IoT helps you conduct thorough research to understand your market and 
customers In this way you are able to create ads your customers like and can relate to 
which ultimately increases brand visibility
2	 Geofencing IoT helps brands conduct locationbased advertising Adding your location to 
your ads allows your customer to understand where youre located and search for you If 
they are close by you have the ability to send them targeted ads If your advert is enticing 
enough they may just want to find out more about your brand 
3	 Remarketing ads This is a targeted way of advertising that brands use to retarget their 
customers This is done using IoT devices that will instantly send ads to customers who 
have visited a brands website or clicked on a social media Remarketing advertising and 
IoT devices are a great combination for brands to connect with their customers
224 CONSUMERS 
Todays consumers have an increasingly sophisticated relationship with brands and digital 
content As youve learnt in Chapter 2 Importance of the customer there are a range of 
motivating factors that drive consumer behaviour As a result of the influence of technology 
todays market has evolved so significantly that it has impacted every generation 
Consumers no longer blindly accept what companies say at face value They perceive brands 
behaviour across multiple channels eg they may follow a brand on social media physically 
visit the store read their reviews and want more personalised offers but may detest sharing 
their information unless they have complete control
Brands marketers and advertisers now have more informed consumers to deal with customers 
who are capable of making sensible decisions by finding out more about a product before 
making a purchase At the same time there is room for negative consumer perceptions in 
digital advertising This is a battle that brands must continue to fight by finding ways in which 
they can recover trust with their customers to improve their online reputation 
We discussed customer experience extensively in Chapter 2 Importance of the customer 
Feel free to revisit some of the concepts to see how they apply to the future of advertising
Humancentred design 
Based on a problemsolving approach that prioritises a human perspective during each of the 
processes humancentred design is often used in design management and engineering It is 
a practical means of determining the most suitable design for consumers because it makes use 
of participation and feedback in the planning process These contributions provide a thorough 
understanding of any issues in the design process because the researcher and participant 
have transparency between them that provides context
