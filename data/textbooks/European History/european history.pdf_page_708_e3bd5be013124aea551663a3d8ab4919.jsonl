workers and miners in Bucharest in June 1990 to physically confront the mainly 
urban academic protesters marching against the Romanian postcommunist 
government 
Conclusion
Work in the twentieth century did not lose its multifaceted nature Especially 
during the first half of the century devastating impacts of different kinds 
of work abounded in Europe alienated work in Fordism forced labour 
in camps or involuntary nonwork as mass unemployment The situation 
improved in some ways during the second half of the twentieth century 
thanks to a powerful and vital welfare state strong unions guaranteeing better 
working conditions and a decline in forced labour On the other hand there 
were new onerous changes Lowpaid jobs which did not guarantee a living 
kept many in precarity with a declining but still indisputable gender pay gap 
job insecurity in a period of growing automation and artificial intelligence 
and the exploitation of work and workers in the Global South in the name of 
lifestyle and consumption in Europe 
While European demographic growth is in decline this will create pressure 
to increase social security for retired pensioners Sooner rather than later this 
will bring either a sharp increase in corporate income tax CIT or a further 
loosening of fiducial restrictions Finally as the fastest growth of GDP is 
observed in regions other than Europe boosting production should be the 
ultimate focus to meet growing expectations for a better standard of living It 
is as yet an open question whether or not such a development will occur in 
Europe the birthplace of capitalism
