UNIT 3 POWER AND CITIZENSHIP
376
From the midnineteenth century onward attempts can be identified to 
codify legal standards for international relations including warfare Arguably 
the most famous example is the Lieber Code of 1863 which explicated the 
law of war for land battles in the American Civil War A year later 1864 the 
first Geneva Convention initiated the modern law of war The Hague Peace 
Conferences 18991907 finally brought farreaching agreements on warfare 
constituting one of the first attempts by the international community to abolish 
war as an institution Even before the Lieber Code fiftyfive nations agreed 
in 1856 to the Declaration of Paris which governed maritime warfare This 
international system was far more institutionalised than the states system of 
the ancien rgime with its loose wartime coalition and cabinet wars It was 
supported by middle men secondtier officials who invested themselves in 
the new culture of security peace and prosperity When the traumas of the 
Napoleonic Wars waned this system still did not completely dissolve or unravel 
in 1822 nor in 1848 as some historians have contended but transformed 
itself and was constantly reconfigured as a system of conflict and security of 
empire and revolution throughout the long nineteenth century The various 
ministerial conferences ambassadorial meetings the making of international 
law and the interimperial rage for order initiated by the empires of Europe 
did not cease to exist but in fact spread across the world and intensified in 
scope and impact up until the First World War and beyond when European 
ambitions and emotions set the world in flames once again 
The European Concert sanctioned the right to interfere in order to maintain 
the security of the states system as a whole As a consequence there were 
various military interventions against revolutionary countries that were seen 
as a potential threat to the system because civil conflict between supporters 
of absolutism and liberalism was far from being eradicated Resultant clashes 
included the Austrian invasion of Italy in 1821 and the French invasion of 
Spain in 1823 The Holy Alliance did not officially intervene in the Greek War 
of Independence 18211830 against the Ottoman Empire but that lack of 
action itself triggered a massive mobilisation of public opinion and resulted in 
many volunteers across the continent mobilising to fight for the independence 
of Greece
This transition not only occurred at the level of statesmen diplomats 
and generals but also at the intellectual and societal levels Liberal doctrine 
promised in its most idealistic version a future of perpetual peace with warlike 
societies replaced by commercial societies against a model of enemies and 
confrontation the prosperity linked to free trade promoted peaceful exchange 
for the benefit of all The nineteenth century thus saw the proliferation of a 
multitude of publications concerning peace and the emergence of organised 
pacifism and mass peace movements all of which indicated a change in social 
values and norms
