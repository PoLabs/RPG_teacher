In Central Europe the religious mosaic is largely the result of early modern 
transformations To an ethnocultural and linguistic heterogeneity existing since 
the Middle Ages growing religious diversity was added from the sixteenth 
century on account of two major changes The first was Ottoman conquest 
in Europe a process begun in the fourteenth century and which continued 
with further expansion in the sixteenth Countries in the southern part of the 
region either became parts of the Ottoman Empire or were contiguous areas 
in direct contact with it and thus witnessed the spread of Islam In territories 
under Ottoman rule the dominance of Islam did not exclude the presence 
of religious minorities Christian and Jewish alike and these territories were 
destinations of evangelising missions The other paramount change was 
the advent of the Reformation which produced a spectrum of Protestant 
communities such as the Lutheran Calvinist Zwinglian Anabaptist and 
Antitrinitarian ones as well as the coming of the subsequent Catholic Reform 
the confrontation between the Reformation and the Catholic Reform produced 
very different confessional landscapes in each part of the region Orthodox 
and Eastern Catholic Christians and a Jewish diaspora enlarged by Askhenazi 
immigration augmented the complexity of these landscapes
Case Study Transylvania
For the religious heterogeneity of Central Europe the Principality of 
Transylvania is a case in point as far as conflict and compromise are concerned 
A fragment of the Hungarian Kingdom falling to pieces with Ottoman conquest 
Transylvania as a newly established state avoided Turkish occupation 
and was paying annual tribute to the Porte In parallel with the Ottoman 
campaigns against Hungary the medieval Catholic Church of Transylvania 
fully disintegrated and its holdings were secularised and given to the treasury 
Catholics became a minority while three Protestant denominations Lutheran 
Calvinist and Antitrinitarian took strong positions all over the country The 
process of confessional change concomitant with political turns can be drawn 
up in three phases during the sixteenth and seventeenthcentury history of 
Transylvania In the first phase Antitrinitarians grew to prominence in the 
political elite of the princely court and Antitrinitarianism was embraced by 
John Sigismund 15401571 the Catholicborn prince In the second phase 
from the 1570s to the 1590s the Catholic ruling family of the Bthorys was 
striving to restore the institutions of their church through the Jesuits the 
pressure of Rome was growing stronger albeit temporarily with Sigismund 
Bthory 15731613 waging war against the Turks with support from Pope 
Clement VIII 15361605 and Emperor Rudolf II of Habsburg 15521612 
The antiOttoman and Catholic project failed the Jesuits were expelled by the
