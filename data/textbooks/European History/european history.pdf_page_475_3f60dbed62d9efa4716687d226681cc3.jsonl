social affairs as a problem of engineering rather than politics in the interwar 
period The technification of administering social affairs emphasising ideas of 
rationalisation standardisation and depolitisation resulted in a largescale 
proliferation of scientific planning In response to the Great Depression of 
the 1930s technocratic forms of governance grew in relevance and popularity 
The atmosphere of postwar reconstruction gave further urgency to such 
attitudes peaking in the 1950s and 1960sa period often characterised as high 
modernism In the name of national development for all and not of profit for 
a few technologies were employed in the construction of large public works 
predominantly various types of technical infrastructures which secured 
general improvements in living standards Consider large dams and flushing 
toilets cold chain logistics and home freezers to name a few Particularly 
under the authoritarian regimes of Eastern Europe during the Cold War state 
authorities and their expert bureaucracies acquired substantial administrative 
powers with which grand designs to transform and order nature and society 
could be developed That said Soviet attempts at planned industrialisation and 
the transformation of nature in Stalins Great Plan of the late 1940s and even 
human beings the New Soviet Man differed only in scale rather than in 
quality from Western European proposals for rational housing and urbanism 
see Le Corbusier for example or for riverimprovement schemes designed 
as blueprints for largescale social transformation through technology
Military technologies and military systemsbuildingthemselves products 
of statebuildingwere the crucial driving force behind technological 
innovation in the modern era In the premodern period military technologies 
reflected change rather than fuelling it consider the relative stability of navy 
ship design from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries But by the twentieth 
century the combined effect of industrialisation and the states growing role in 
society including its management of technological innovations had ushered 
in the statesponsored development of technological change This also blurred 
the threshold between peace and war as nationstates tended to employ war 
as a political tool Particularly since the Second World War national military
industrial complexes have been driving technological change Developments 
of missiles rocket science associated especially with prewar Soviet and 
German military research programmes and nuclear technologies United 
States can serve as primary examples here Computing and the Internet
again predominantly developed by US actors ARPANET and later imported 
to Europeclearly document such a tendency The ideas of automation the 
reduction of human factors in processes ranging from factory production to 
data collection and communications and digitisation the conversion of data 
into a computerreadable format did indeed receive prominent attention 
from military strategists who faced wartime labour shortages at home and
