and feminine qualities such as spiritual babyhood bliss passivity 
emotionalism and the loss of inhibition 
Some women became leaders of spiritual sects Antoinette Bourignon 1616
1680 raised as a Catholic in the Southern Netherlands through her visions 
and conversations with God grew convinced that she had been chosen by 
Him as His instrument for salvation She started publishing religious writings 
and gathered people around her in Amsterdam Germany and Scotland 
Aiming to restore true Christianity on earth before the immanent end of time 
Bourignon called herself the mother of the true Christians thus relating 
to her followers in both an authoritative and affective way She symbolically 
turned the hierarchy between men and women and between clergy and laity 
upside down while highlighting the motherchild bond As a spiritual mother 
she thus united her followers as brothers and sisters The Flemish prophetess 
employed the stereotypical images of the empty vessel the unlearned virgin 
and the spiritual mother as weapons to gain spiritual leadership over a group 
of mainly male followers At the same time she published her works herself 
and can be seen as the commercial manager of a religious business enterprise 
However critics accused Bourignon of leading a group of married men as 
an unmarried woman suggesting illicit sexual contact between them Some 
called her a witch inspired by Satan
Planning to establish a community of true Christians on the North German 
island of Nordstrand Bourignon formulated community rules including 
sobriety moderation the abolition of private property and a certain measure 
of equality She also prescribed the breaking of bonds with the outside world 
Everyone was welcome regardless of wealth age religion nationality or dis
ability In practice however not everyone turned out to be able to work for the 
common good thus a remnant of selfishness remained 
Gender and Class in Utopian Communities
In 1675 a similar religious community was founded by the Labadists in the 
village of Wieuwerd within the Dutch province of Friesland With 600 members 
at its height the community was oriented around principles of holiness and 
gender equality Here too all property was communal and sartorial rules 
emphasised simplicity Men and women from different countries ate at the 
same table often in silence yet there was a hierarchy distinguishing senior 
from junior members In later Labadist colonies in Surinam and Maryland 
slaves were heldtotal equality was a myth The community in Wieuwerd 
moreover had to reintroduce private property after twenty years as its source 
of funding dried up
