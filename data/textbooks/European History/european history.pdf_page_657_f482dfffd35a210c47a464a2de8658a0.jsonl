Introduction
At the beginning of the nineteenth century Europe and especially its 
northwestern part emerged as the global economic core at the centre of long
distance trade routes connecting virtually all continents around the globe 
Over the previous centuries Europeans consolidated their position in the 
world economy and accumulated wealth without actually producing goods 
of particular interest to other parts of the world instead enriching itself by 
trading products originating out of Asia Africa and America The European 
position within global trade networks contributed to specific circumstances 
which gave rise to industrialisation and modern economic growth Relatively 
high wages when compared to the rest of the world and a relative abundance 
of goods coming from overseas created a pressure towards transformations 
of production and consumption patternsknown as mechanisation and 
industrialisationwhich in turn helped to create conditions for transition 
towards the sustained economic growth associated with industrial capitalism 
Initially located in areas along the Atlantic Coast the transition soon affected 
even the most distant corners of the continent However the spread of 
industrialisation and modern economic growth produced important spatial 
inequalities The differentiation of the European territory followed the North
West SouthEast gradient with western countries adopting changes more 
quickly around the 1850s and becoming the economic core while Eastern 
and Southern Europe reacted more slowly and rather than developing 
industrialisation instead provided agricultural products for the West
Economic Growth
Economic historians of Europe generally interpret the nineteenth century as 
a period marking the decisive transition from the traditional growth model
