UNIT 3
351 Protest and Social Movements in 
Early Modern History ca 15001800
Laurent Brassart and Maarten Prak
Introduction
Traditionally the early modern period has been seen as an era of social 
movements and protest for the simple reason that ordinary people had 
no alternative means to make their voices heard before the rise of modern 
democracy We now know that democratic procedures did exist long before 
1789 albeit locally much more than nationally Nonetheless that protest 
and social movements shaped the era can be seen from the two revolutions 
bracketing the early modern period the Reformation at the beginning and 
the French Revolution that marked its end Between those two revolutions 
many more political upheavals occurred shaped by the involvement of large 
numbers of people Think of the Fronde in France and the English Civil 
War both in the middle of the seventeenth century However most of those 
upheavals never made it into the history textbooks because they were too 
small or shortlived Still they sustained a tradition of popular mobilisation 
that would prove crucial during major events
Following much of the historical literature we have made a distinction in 
this chapter between urban and rural revolts and revolutions We have also 
decided to discuss at some greater length the two most significant social 
movement events of the period the Reformation and the French Revolution 
In our discussion we will look at causes numbers of protesters and their social 
profile and at insurrectionary repertoires and demands It is our claim that 
protest and social movements were not isolated incidents but rather structural 
features of political life in early modern Europe
