Introduction
The European thinkers of the early modern era are essential for understanding 
the development of political thought in general Their contributions brought 
about paradigm shifts in the way politics was thought of and experienced 
Although their writings were known only to a few many channels helped to 
spread their ideas In order to understand the foundations of modern political 
thought and its evolution during the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries we must identify the cultures in which the great intellectuals lived 
and worked some of them like Machiavelli and Bossuet siding with the 
rulers others distancing themselves from the elite while remaining aware of 
the theological ecclesiastical legal or political stakes of the disputes of their 
time Let us note from the outset that dissident thought which would be 
that of a perspective on the role of the prince does not necessarily emerge 
from observers who do not hold power and that it is not possible to dissociate 
conformist intellectuals from dissident intellectuals in modern political 
thought Thomas Hobbes legitimised the strong power of the sovereign 
considering it a good companion of the natural rights of peoples 1651 
Franois Fnelon remained close to Louis XIV for a long time but expressed 
his reservations in The Adventures of Telemachus 1699 not to mention the 
ambiguity with which the philosophers of the Enlightenment praised despots 
In this chapter therefore political ideas are presented in terms of the questions 
they reflected as well as in terms of the political criticism they conveyed The 
central issue in these debates is the implementation of good government the 
strict definition of which varies according to the period In order to understand 
these debates we must appreciate the hold of the state and religion on peoples 
minds at the time understand the notion of freedom in its context and observe 
the dialogue between society and the powers that be
