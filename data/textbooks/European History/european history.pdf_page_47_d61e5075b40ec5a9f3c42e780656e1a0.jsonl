unification of continental Europe against Britain and Soviet Russia According to 
him only a PanEuropean Union could guarantee freedom prosperity and
above allindependence from American and Soviet influence Coudenhove
Kalergi not only disseminated his ideas widely through his newspaper 
Paneuropa but also managed to secure the support of prominent figures of 
the political sphere in Europemost notably Aristide Briand 18621932 the 
contemporary foreign minister of France 
Briand also played a major role in FrancoGerman reconciliation which 
was often seen as an essential precondition for the construction of a peaceful 
Europe He and his German counterpart Gustav Stresemann were awarded 
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926 for their efforts In a resounding speech before 
the League of Nations on 5 September 1929 Briand imagined a federal link 
and a link of solidarity between European countries a vision which took 
concrete form in September 1930 in a memorandum outlining the contours of 
a peaceful and united Europe
The First World War also triggered awareness of the continents waning 
diplomatic and economic force especially in relation to the rising power of 
the United States In this context the industrial and business community 
endeavoured to bring the European economies closer together guided by 
French writer Gaston Rious 18831958 injunction to Unite or die For 
example the International Steel Agreement and the Potash Cartel were created 
in 1926 under the leadership of the Luxembourg industrialist Emile Mayrisch 
Leaders of socialist movements also proposed a united Europe but their 
designs differed in terms of the degree of political integration envisioned The 
Russian revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky 18791940disagreeing with 
Lenin 18701924published a socialist vision of the United States of Europe 
against the backdrop of a strengthened United States In an article published 
in the newspaper Pravda on 30 June 1923 Trotsky argued for a proletarian 
European Union In his view capitalism had proven unable to solve the 
economic problems that had plagued the European continent since the end of 
the war He stressed that given the differing pace of proletarian revolutions 
in each country tight economic cooperation of the European people in a 
united and socialist European federation was a necessary intermediate stage 
towards world revolution Trotsky argued that a united Europe of workers 
and peasants would resolve the tensions between European states over natural 
resources and reparations He proposed property and wealth taxes to refinance 
reparations that would be distributed from a common European reparations
budget Customs barriers would be unnecessary in this centrally planned and 
unified European economy According to Trotsky only a socialist European 
Union could prevent the United States from eventually taking control of 
Europe
