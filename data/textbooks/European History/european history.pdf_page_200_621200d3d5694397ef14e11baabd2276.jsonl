In binational states or dynastically connected countries with two large 
nations ethnic relations and issues of national identity were complicated in 
a different way In the nineteenth century countries and regions continued 
to change hands in Europe as the result of wars and subsequent treaties by 
which rising powers satisfied their expansionist ambitions For example 
Denmark and Norway formed a dual monarchy together from 1537 to 1814 
which also contained Iceland Greenland and the Faroe Islands with their 
native populations and languages But then Norway was ceded to Sweden in 
the Treaty of Kiel in 1814 As Norwegians refused to accept this solution and 
declared their independence a personal union ie two countries joined by 
the person of the monarch with Sweden was created as a compromise lasting 
until 1905 In a country like DenmarkNorway linguistic differences among 
the major ethnic communities were not exceedingly sharp as the languages 
remained fairly close to each other until the end of the early modern period 
and even beyond At the same time Danish clearly dominated in official usage 
until 1814 So the nineteenthcentury Norwegian cultural renaissancevery 
similar in nature to kindred revivalist movements in early nineteenthcentury 
East Central Europe and other peripheral areas of the continentdid not 
merely strive to make the Norwegian language more distinct from the other 
Scandinavian languages by purification for example the replacement of 
foreign loan words by indigenous ones and spelling reforms but was also 
faced with the task of having to create a modern literary language
In other cases new ethnically compound countries were created from 
territories which had previously been ruled by other monarchies Following a 
revolution in 1830 Belgium formerly part of the Protestantdominated United 
Kingdom of the Netherlands was created in 1830 as an independent bilingual 
country comprised of Dutchspeaking Flemish and Frenchspeaking Walloon 
inhabitants 
Multiethnic Empires
Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries large parts of 
Central and Eastern Europe formed portions of multinational and multiethnic 
empires namely the Habsburg Monarchy and the Russian Empire A third 
imperial power the Ottoman Empire ruled the peoples of the Balkans and 
although it was increasingly forced to give up control over territories during 
the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries it controlled a substantial part 
of southeastern Europe for much of the period discussed in this chapter As 
mentioned above the German Empire also included significant nonGerman 
populations as the result of Prussias territorial acquisitions in earlier 
centuries
