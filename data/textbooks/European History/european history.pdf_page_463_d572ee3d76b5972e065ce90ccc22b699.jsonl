41 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE

voyage on the ship HMS Beagle bore testimony to this as did Alexander von 
Humboldts earlier trip to Spanish Latin America as do the vast collections in 
the natural history museums of European capitals to this day The provenance 
of these collections and discoveries in regimes of colonial domination stands 
in stark contrast to their insight into the diversity of life and its ecological 
dimensions thus revealing a downside of scientific progress Similar could 
be said of the damage done to humankind and the environment by the 
developing industries of this period
Diseases such as cholera or tuberculosis became a challenge to medical 
science in the nineteenth century spreading due to the pauperisation and 
urbanisation of industrialising states as well as increasing international 
commerce The European empires each pursued research on what came to 
be known as infections of the human body by invading microorganisms 
Louis Pasteur Robert Koch and Joseph Lister were celebrated as heroes of the 
triumphalist narratives of scientific modernity This has sometimes obscured 
competing explanations which gave the social factors of suffering and epidemics 
more weight than biology Statesanctioned hygiene policies disinfection 
vaccination and statefunded institutionsultimately undergirded by 
the persistent dream of silver bullets that would free humankind of these 
scourgesremain an enduring heritage of the latenineteenth century and the 
golden age of both hygiene and bacteriology Equally persistent though is 
the critique of such ideals of health and purity not least regarding the colonial 
context or eugenics
The global expansion of the British and French empires in particular but 
also all kinds of lesser actors along with transatlantic exchange migration 
and commerce brought with it the need for faster communication which 
was established in this period by intercontinental telegraph cables In turn 
these electrical networks had repercussions on the perception of space and 
time paving the way towards conceptual innovations that culminated in the 
theory of relativity in the 1910s Time zones or the standardisation of units in 
the metric system would cast an evergrowing web of measurement across 
the planet and the universe supported by ideas of universal languages and 
repositories which could catalogue the masses of new knowledge But the 
prestige of sciences pursuit of an ideal of mechanical objectivity bolstered 
by technologies such as photography did not remain uncontested Critique 
and scepticism of the positivist ideal abounded in literature religious 
activities and the humanities pitching it against the individual tradition or 
irrationalism Even a founding figure of the social sciences such as Max Weber 
would soberly concede in 1917 that the sciences could only yield descriptive 
causal analyses but could never tell a human being what they ought to do 
in a normative sense Thus at the turn of the twentieth century the modern
