cut and a couture seam European states have often called on this function 
or illusory promise of separation and protection and they continue to do so 
when reestablishing their border systemswith Brexit the socalled refugee 
crisis in 2015 and the Covid19 lockdown as telling examples As a result 
borders have generated diametrically opposed responses from demands for 
their abolition to drastic measures to reinforce them In his plea Pour lEurope 
For Europe 1963 the French politician Robert Schuman 18861963 one 
of the architects of the European Communities argued that one of the aims 
of European integration was finding a position between these two poles It is 
not a question of obliterating ethnic and political borders They are a historical 
fact and we do not presume to correct history  What we want is to remove 
the rigidity from borders what I would call their intransigent hostility
