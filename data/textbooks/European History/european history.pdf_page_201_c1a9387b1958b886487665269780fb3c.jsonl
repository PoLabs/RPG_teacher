22 INTERETHNIC RELATIONS
181
Unlike states in Western Europe empires in the eastern part of the continent 
remained ethnically diverse until the end of the nineteenth century and even 
beyond Many historical reasons stood behind that Firstly the empires of 
nineteenthcentury Central and Eastern Europe had been formed over the 
centuries of ethnically and culturally diverse lands which often adhered 
to their own political traditions and institutions and were linked together 
by ruling dynasties Secondly the policies of assimilation by the state elites 
appeared relatively late in the late eighteenth century in Austria and even later 
in Russia Thirdly in some places such as the Ottoman Empire or the Baltic 
region in Russia language diversity also served as a social barrier imposed 
by the ruling classes on the masses Less advanced economies and relatively 
underdeveloped systems of communication and transport also hindered 
stronger assimilation The ethnic map was therefore particularly diverse More 
importantly the power relations between states and ethnic groups as well as 
among ethnic groups varied widely and tended to change over time
An Example of a Multiethnic Empire Ethnic Relations in 
the Habsburg Monarchy
Until the emergence of national movements in the first half of the nineteenth 
century the multiethnic character of the Habsburg Empire did not cause 
serious difficulties for Habsburg governments nor did it lead to conflicts 
among diverse ethnic groups Emperor Joseph II r 17801790 promoted the 
German language as a lingua franca in the Habsburg Empire regarding it as 
a tool of efficient centralisation provoking a resistance that can be interpreted 
as a sign of rising national consciousness in various parts of the empire Apart 
from that however the Habsburg governance of diverse areas rested on a 
degree of respect for local languages religions cultural and political traditions 
Early nineteenthcentury movements of national awakening as they were 
called in Central and Eastern Europe were primarily cultural movements but 
they gradually acquired stronger political overtones The ideology of modern 
nationalism was intertwined with liberal ideas the peoples of the Habsburg 
Monarchy were no longer content with the political system of the centralised 
empire and its absolutist government and demanded greater individual rights 
and freedoms as well as collective rights and autonomies Linguistic and 
cultural communities increasingly defined themselves as nations Emerging 
national movements within the Habsburg Empire often had conflicting goals 
and interests and could be consciously pitted against each other by Austrian 
governmentsas the revolutionary events of 18481849 amply demonstrated 
In 1867 the AustroHungarian Compromise created the AustroHungarian 
Monarchy the official name of the Habsburg Empire between 1867 and 1918
