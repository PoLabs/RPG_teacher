the steam locomotive 1814 But agricultural production was also transformed 
by the steam ploughwhich enabled the mechanisation of ploughing
and especially by the steam threshing machine 1849 which enabled the 
mechanisation of grain threshing
In fact without an increase in agricultural productivity industrialisation 
would not have been possible Workers were ableand hadto leave 
agriculture and make a living from industry in increasing numbers agricultural 
productivity improved so even fewer hands were necessary to increase 
agricultural production which in turn rendered additional agricultural 
workers surplus The development of agricultural productivity was made 
possible by crop rotation the use of iron tools seed selection stable livestock 
farming fertilisation later chemical manure and the mechanisation of certain 
work phases such as threshing and ploughing Although the development of 
agriculture made industrialisation possible its progressive industrialisation 
also had repercussions as a growing primarily urban population engaged 
in industrial labour had to be provided with food Thus industrialisation 
resulted in increasing demand for agriculture encouraging further increases 
in agricultural productivity
Industrial production also underwent significant transformation during 
industrialisation Former handicraft production was gradually replaced by 
the manufactory industry and from the beginning of the nineteenth century 
an increasing number of factories appeared Factory productionas a new 
institutional form of productionmeant a division of labour mechanised 
production with a much larger number of workers into the thousands using 
machines driven by steam power later electricity Factories also enabled the 
mass production of goods which reduced the price of industrial products 
and made them available to a wider range of consumers This in turn had 
a significant effect on the culture of consumption In addition to a larger 
workforce mechanised largescale production required much more capital as 
the acquisition and operation of machinery the maintenance of factories and 
the use of a larger labour force significantly increased the financial resources 
required by industry The higher need for capital in the age of industrialisation 
resulted in the spread of jointstock companies where the cost and risk of 
production were shared among several shareholders However the joint
stock company was important not only as a new source of capital but as an 
institutional innovation of capitalism itself The division of labour and the 
specialisation of all work processes ie not only production characterise the 
operation of a jointstock company This also allows effectiveness in highly 
complex workflows for example in corporate governance and control and 
enables diverse activities such as the mass production of a wide variety of 
products or simultaneous sales on different markets British Economist Ronald
