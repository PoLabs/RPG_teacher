35 PROTEST AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS
421
During the 1970s feminism quickly became the single most important 
social movement in Western Europe Though women in most of Europe had 
already gained the right to vote at least twenty years earlier they still had 
lowerpaid jobs and the additional burden of unpaid housework while men 
monopolised power in political parties companies and even protest groups 
Organising amongst themselves women engaged in consciousnessraising 
created their own media and publishing houses and launched transnational 
campaigns for abortion rights Only months after 343 French women publicly 
declared in April 1971 that they had had illegal abortions 374 West German 
women made a similar declaration on the cover of a magazine The womens 
movement of the 1970s inspired gay liberation as well as later movements 
challenging intersecting oppressions of race class and gender
Protests over peace human rights and the environment developed in 
parallel While the upheavals of 1968 remained an important point of reference 
demonstrations against the stationing of American nuclear warheads in West 
Germany in 19811983 attracted millions of participantsfar more than 
the thousands that had protested there in 1968 The arms race of the 1980s 
the Chernobyl nuclear power accident 1986 and the war in the former 
Yugoslavia 19912001 also illustrated that these and other issues were 
globally interconnected As the Cold War gave way to a new wave of capitalist 
globalisation in the 1990s disparate social movements converged again for a 
time in a movement of movements that contested the inequalities created by 
globalisation
