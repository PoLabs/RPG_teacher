completely eliminated Priority was given to the development of heavy and 
military industry due to the tensions of the Cold War However the planned 
economy soon proved that the stateowned enterprises only fulfilled the plans 
imposed on them quantitatively without enough attention to quality 
All socialist countries experienced these problems of the planned economy 
and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance Comecon did not help 
However when social tensions became critical due to supply problems the 
party leaderships made concessions to private craft retail and towards a 
socalled second economy Participation in the second economy necessary 
in the socialist era to procure products in short supply became for many a 
matter of survival 
The first changes in this direction took place in 1953 after Stalins death Then 
after the 1956 Polish and Hungarian crises new reforms were undertaken and 
more changes followed in the mid1960s Of these new policies the Hungarian 
New Economic Mechanism was the most radical as it wanted to combine the 
market economy with the planned economy However these reforms were 
halted after the 1968 invasion of Prague Later due to the growing indebtedness 
of socialist countries another series of reforms was launched in the first half 
of the 1980s 
Consumption
Patterns of consumption differed greatly in the early twentieth century 
throughout Europe not just between countries but also within regions While 
European metropoles and the upper and uppermiddle classes experienced 
the beginning of a modern consumer society including the use of an 
automobile and electricity at home rural patterns of consumption changed 
less rapidly Although consumption overall increased in the first half of the 
twentieth century it was not a linear process Economic crises such as the 
Great Depression had disastrous effects Even in most advanced consumer 
societies such as Great Britain many could not afford even basic consumer 
goods The two World Wars and totalitarian regimes brought food shortages 
and rationing in most countries as well
Mass consumer societies therefore only fully emerged in the second half 
of the century In line with economic growth an increase in production and 
the expansion of the welfare state household expenditure income in Western 
Europe significantly increased As a result larger sections of society were 
able to afford durable and expensive consumer goods such as telephones 
televisions and cars The decades following the Second World War also saw 
shifts in expenditure from basic commodities such as food and clothing to 
nonessential goods like leisure expenditure travel and transport
