unprecedented number of young people an extended phase for activism and 
selfactualisation between youth and adulthood 
Secondly the lines of conflict between the generations were not as sharp as 
has often been suggested Research shows that the families of activists often 
supported political protest and the goals of their children making it important 
to differentiate between familial generational relations and public ones Public 
generational relations were often strained during the protests of the long 1968 
and afterwards Leftwing activism even led to conservative electoral backlash 
securing the election of conservative parties in Denmark and the US in 1968 
or Great Britain in 1970 for example Despite the backlash or the explicit 
radicalism of activists there was no deepseated or open hostility between 
generations In fact most Western European countries lowered the voting age 
to eighteen during the 1970s Thirdly the activists who took part in 1968 did 
not represent their entire generation Although the degree of workingclass 
activism in the 1968 movements varied from country to country and was 
especially high in France and Italy protests were mainly carried out by highly 
educated middle and upperclass youths Young workingclass people had 
a more positive attitude towards the protests than their seniors but not as 
positive or supportive an attitude as that among academics 
Neotribes and Postmodern Subcultures
According to Michel Maffesoli 1988 some of the subcultures of the late
twentieth century could also be understood as a renaissance of tribal social 
organisation His neotribes were often employed in the debates over the 
early1990s rave subculture in the United Kingdom Tribal symbols rituals 
and myths are also often discussed in relation to football hooliganismand 
to a lesser extent skinhead scenes However many of the members of these 
informal youth groups identified with the symbols rituals and overall style 
of one or more subcultures without necessarily identifying with all of the 
meanings that were implied For instance Czech football support groups of 
the late 1990s identified themselves by various means fans could be observed 
wearing heavymetal denim jackets and punkrock tshirts combined with 
skinhead boots There were also normal fans who did not display any visible 
association with a subculture Skinheads in hooligan gangs often left their 
Harrington or bomber jackets and Dr Martens boots at home Instead of Fred 
Perry or Lonsdale polo shirts they wore Umbro or Adidas tshirts and jogging 
sneakers adopting a rather casual hooligan style Nevertheless hooligan 
gangs were not composed entirely of skinheads Their common feature was 
that they were composed almost entirely of young males between the ages of 
fifteen and thirtyfive with most participants in their early twenties Fascist
