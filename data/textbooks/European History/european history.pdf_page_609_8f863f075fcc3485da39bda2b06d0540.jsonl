Transformation of Eastern Europe 
The economic systems of Eastern Europe prior to the collapse of communism 
were seen in these countries as having eliminated the exploitation and loss

find this feasible there was still the possibility of compensation via marketable 
bonds In most cases what happened was a rapid concentration of capital in 
the hands of a few The solutions proved to be relatively wellaccepted by the
