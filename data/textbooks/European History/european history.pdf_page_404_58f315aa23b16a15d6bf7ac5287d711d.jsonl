attempts to properly define it During the century in question most militant 
action took place in the name of peace and fascists socialists and democrats 
alike coopted the language of peace for their own political aims There was 
therefore an unprecedented politicisation of peace that sometimes advanced 
its cause and at other times thwarted its realisation
Firstly attempts to realise a nonviolent reordering of international affairs 
took place between governments In the aftermath of the Great War there were 
two opposing ideas for the restructuring of the world One was pronounced 
by American President Woodrow Wilson 18561924 in his Fourteen Points 
address and the other was promulgated by Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin 
18701924 in his Decree on Peace which called for social reform if not 
revolution Often negotiating peace led to the signing of peace treaties or 
the creation of international organisations that would guarantee collective 
security The League of Nations founded in 1920 was one result succeeded 
by the United Nations following the end of the Second World War Indeed 
a flurry of European organisations were created in the service of peace in 
the postwar period with the most enduring being the European Economic 
Community created in 1957 and the Council of Europe founded in 1949 
For much of its history peace was predominantly driven by religious 
motives However it was during the twentieth century that socialists and 
feminists broadened the agenda to point to issues of social and economic 
justice and the unfairness of patriarchal society The active involvement of 
women in different pacifist organisations such as the Womens International 
League for Peace and Freedom created in 1919 were extremely active 
throughout the century significantly influencing the peace agenda The 
gendering of peace meant more attention was paid to social dimensions This 
demand was accentuated in the postwar years of recovery where there was a 
powerful expectation in Europe that 1945 would herald a new age In this new 
era most nation states in the continent perceived material and social security 
as a precondition for a peaceful settlement Prosperity was sought on all 
fronts with countries like Britain hosting popular campaigns on the need for 
a welfare system and investing renewed interest in volunteering relief work 
and humanitarianism
It was also during this period that mobilisation for peace became more 
systematic Largescale peace movements took place after the end of the First 
World War during the interwar years and peaked in the 1980s The mobilisation 
against the deployment of US Pershing and Cruise missiles armed with atomic 
warheads reinvigorated the peace movements In Great Britain 400000 people 
turned up at Hyde Park in October 1983 opposing missile deployment while the 
Federal Republic of Germany was similarly swept up in antinuclear fervour 
with more than one million joining the antimissile demonstrations The
