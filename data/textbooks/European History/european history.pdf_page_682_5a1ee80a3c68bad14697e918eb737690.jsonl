of human capital Training in early modern Europe was regimented by guilds 
that restricted both the supply of skilled labour and output thus regulating 
prices Workers had to go through years of apprenticeship to become certified 
craftsmen Due to the high training costs wage differences between skilled 
and unskilled workersconstituting a socalled skill premiumwere high
Unskilled labourers constituted the majority of the free wage earners 
Data on the daily wages of construction workers from across Europe serves 
as a helpful proxy for their living standards They were typically among the 
poorest urban dwellers Nominal wages received for their labour increased 
across early modern Europe but this rise was a result of the inflation caused by 
the inflow of precious metals from the Americas At the same time basic prices 
food housing clothing rose even faster contributing to at best stagnation 
or decline in levels of income
Wages of unskilled workers were high in the period directly after the Black 
Death 1348 The low availability of labour and its higher marginal productivity 
in theory less available labour equals fewer diminishing returns to any extra 
unit of labour and thus higher wages initiated what is known as the golden 
age of labour in preindustrial Europe However on the wholeeverywhere 
outside the Low Countries and Englandwages ultimately declined during 
the early modern period The most common explanation is population growth 
or the socalled Malthusian trap productivity gains were eventually offset by 
demographic pressures which drove down wages while also leading to higher 
food prices and lower overall living standards Comparatively speaking the 
North Sea region continued to increase agricultural output and maintain 
higher standards of living for longer than the rest of the continent This was 
due to the use of animal power and manure to increase farm productivity 
which in turn provided the means to offset population growth by importing 
grains Yet despite these productivity gains wages of agricultural workers 
remained below those in the cities which further stimulated urbanisation in 
the long run
Higher wages in cities meant that more labourers could use their purchasing 
power to afford education By one estimate between 1500 and 1800 literacy 
in England and the Netherlands increased from six to ten percent to fifty
three to sixtyeight percent respectively By contrast wages in Southern and 
Eastern Europe remained lower as were literacy rates which remained below 
twenty percent At the same time a greater supply of skilled labour explains 
the lower skill premium in the North Sea region As higher wages also imply 
higher opportunity costs for not working this constellation may explain the 
emergence of what scholarship calls the industrious revolution it is held that 
higher wages afforded skilled workers the ability to buy imported goods tea 
coffee sugar which served as direct rewards for their higher productivity
