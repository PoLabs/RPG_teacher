53 PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
653
In the initial period of socialist systems in Eastern Europe industrial 
development gave priority to heavy industry with an emphasis on military 
industry This precedence decreased the relative importance of all remaining 
sectors agriculture light industry services As a result there appeared a 
gradual shortage of food and consumer goods In order to build a socialist 
system the party leaderships expected socialist citizens to limit or postpone 
their consumption desires Constant queuing empty shelves and chronic 
shortages of basic products became part of everyday life The first major 
economic adjustment began after Stalins death Gradually the Iron Curtain 
became more permeable and the perception of the West began to change 
Khrushchev proclaimed the twentyyear programme to catch up and overtake 
advanced capitalist countries 19601980 The competition between the socialist 
and capitalist systems also extended to consumption From the 1960s there 
was a rapid growth in mass consumption giving households access to goods 
such as washing machines vacuum cleaners and televisions Additionally 
in the socialist countries there was a wider supply of collective goods at least 
in comparison to similar income countries elsewhere for example education 
facilities cultural events and sports facilities were very often in higher supply 
than in certain capitalist countries
While Great Britain had a clear leading role as a consumer society in 
Europe between 1930 and 1990 the years between 1970 and 1990 also saw a 
great expansion of consumer goods in most Eastern and Western European 
countries However the prices of coveted consumer goods in the East were set 
at such high levels that the possibility to buy them was limited
The expansion in consumer goods did not come to an end in the 1970s like 
the boom in economic growth and production did Less welloff sections of 
society especially have only been able to fully participate in mass consumer 
society since the 1970s and 1980s As a result differences between the haves 
and the havenots diminished Therefore taste became the dominant form of 
distinction according to French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu Since many people 
now owned cars brand size and features became important to highlight 
ones status As in the West privatelyowned vehicles became the symbol of 
the familys wellbeing and sophistication in Eastern Europe However the 
socialist automotive industry could not produce enough to meet demand 
so those people who could afford a car had to wait years for them to arrive 
It is worth noting that within Sovietbloc countries stateowned banks were 
offering loans and credits only for designated products eg construction of 
a house The policy stands in sharp opposition to the marketdriven scheme 
of financing offered to customers in different product and service categories
