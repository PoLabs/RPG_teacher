quarter of the world population lived in Europe By 2000 it was less than one 
eighth 
Population growth outside of Europe especially in the 1960s provoked 
dark predictions of imminent overpopulation The thennatural increase of 
population such as in central America 32 per cent or northern and central 
Africa as well as southeastern Asia 27 per cent seemed to pose a threat 
in terms of resource consumption Europe at the peak of the demographic 
transition never grew faster than 15 per cent per year even while its leading 
countries colonised other continents The question remains as to how long 
the demographic transition in the countries of the Global South will last 
The natural increase of populations in Africa Asia and Latin America was 
lower in the 1990s than thirty years earlier Recent UN estimates anticipate the 
stabilisation of the world population at around ten billion during the second 
half of the twentyfirst century 
The decline of the birth rate in Europe has been slower in the twentyfirst 
century in comparison to its steep decline during the last three decades of the 
previous century The total fertility rate according to Eurostat is also slightly 
higher today than at the end of the twentieth century 143 live births per 
woman in 2001 and 153 in 2019 Although the outlook is less pessimistic now 
than in the 1990s the population decrease of Europe caused by the second 
demographic transition is unlikely to be overcome in the following decades 
Immigration became the most important source of European population 
growth long before the last decades of the twentieth century 
However the very different patterns of presentday emigration from and 
immigration to European countries also reflect the deep impact of the history 
of the EastWest rift caused by the Cold War A paradigmatic example for 
these oftentimes divergent developments inside Europe can even be found 
inside the formerly divided state of Germany while the western regions and 
its capital city Berlin attract immigrants from all over the world the eastern 
German town of Eisenhttenstadt just eighty kilometres from Berlin at the 
Polish border is a centre of emigration and depopulation its population has 
halved from a peak of 53048 in 1988 to only 23878 in 2019 and parts of the city 
that once supported this larger population are scheduled to be dismantled 
Discussion questions
1	
In which ways was twentiethcentury demographic development 
different in Eastern and Western Europe
2	
In which ways did immigration shape European society in the 
twentieth century
3	
Does Europe need immigration Why or why not
