worshippers in the liturgy The second constitution Lumen Gentium Light 
of the Nations abandons the dogma of papal infallibility which made the 
Pope a true monarch Instead the constitution emphasises the equality of the 
members of the people of God where each is called to holiness as well 
as the role of the bishops and the laity The Catholic Church also recognises in 
this central text that there are elements of truth in other Christian churches 
not mere heresies to be eradicated The declarations Nostra aetate on relations 
with nonChristian religions and Dignitatis humanae on religious freedom 
also mark a clear shift in favour of tolerance and religious freedom In the last 
constitution Gaudium et Spes the Church officially expresses its position on 
the Church in the modern world affirming its commitment to the poor
If Vatican II corresponds to an opening of the Church to the world and an 
aggiornamento the pontificate of John Paul II Karol Jozef Wojtyla 19202005 
corresponds to a backlash  While he was a cardinal Karol Wojtyla was an 
active member of the Second Vatican Council A proponent of modernising 
the image of the Catholic Church he supported many of the reforms adopted 
by the Assembly of Bishops From his native Poland he nevertheless observed 
with concern the consequences of the Second Vatican Council on a Church that 
was undergoing profound reform not without trauma and internal conflicts 
Close to Opus Dei he was critical not only of certain liturgical excesses the 
introduction of secular texts or music among other things but also of many 
of the concrete applications of the councils decisions He was strengthened in 
his convictions by his Polish Catholicism vigorous in his spirituality marked 
by the cult of the Virgin Mary rigid in his morals culturally hegemonic in 
Polish society where he was the cement of the nation and the soul of the 
resistance to communism All of this was to lead the Pope to a doctrinal moral 
and institutional restoration of the Catholic Church at the end of the twentieth 
century
Twentiethcentury religion developed very differently depending on the 
national context In the case of Spain after the secularist experience of the 
Second Republic between 1931 and 1936 Catholicism played a very active 
role in the Spanish Civil War 19361939 in its decision to support the coup 
dtat against the democratic republican government The Catholic Crusade 
as the war was called initiated a close collaboration between the Catholic 
Church and Francos dictatorship consolidated after the Second World War 
when the dictator moved away from the defeated fascist ideas and completely 
redefined the dictatorship as a conservative Catholic and anticommunist 
regimean ideal definition to navigate the dynamics of the Cold War Spanish 
Catholicism would thus enjoy decades of doctrinal and ideological hegemony 
This situation was confirmed with the signing of the 1953 Concordat between 
the Spanish State and the Vatican which legitimised the dictatorship through 
mutual collaboration This marked the beginning of National Catholicism
