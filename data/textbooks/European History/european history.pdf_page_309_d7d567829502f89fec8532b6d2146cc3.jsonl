did not prevail Finland retained its Swedish minority Italy still contains Alto 
AdigeSdtirol Belgium consists of two or even three dominant linguistic 
parts Switzerland is multiethnic and so was Yugoslavia until its dissolution 
in the early 1990s Spain has Catalan Galician and Basque linguistic minorities 
that support on different levels their own national projects 
Ethnic cleansing and coerced demographic alterations before and after 1945 
increased cultural and ethnic uniformity in Eastern European countries the 
abundant Jewish populations of countries such as Poland Hungary Greece 
and the Baltic states were nearly exterminated during the Holocaust Roma and 
Sinti were also targeted by Nazi Germany After the war huge demographic 
groups were expelled from their homelands and relocated elsewhere Germans 
were expelled from almost all Eastern countries Czechoslovakia Poland the 
Baltic states Romania Poles were forced to leave the Polish territories ceded 
to Belarus and Ukraine and were resettled in Pomerania and Silesia A few 
years later many Slavs Bulgarians Macedonians were expelled from Greece 
during the Greek Civil War
However all these massive demographic changes did not lead to perfectly 
homogeneous communities for example there are still Hungarian minorities 
in Serbia Slovakia and Romania Roma and Sinti live in the whole region and 
Turks in Bulgaria Moreover in countries such as France Germany and the 
Netherlands which also have their own historical minorities the combined 
effects of decolonisation and the need for guest workers from Turkey and 
the Maghreb countries led to the influx of various new minorities since the 
1960s  African Latin American and Asian immigration has grown in nearly 
all European countries since 2000 This tension between the homogeneous 
underpinnings of nations as primordialist nationalists and many citizens 
who share their views understand them and the realities of multiethnic and 
multicultural societies is hence highly relevant in most European societies 
today
The autonomy of the nationstate has also been challenged by European 
integration After the Second World War the United States of America 
demanded coordination between Western European states in order to 
distribute Marshall Plan aid and to strengthen defence mechanisms in view of 
the Cold War Another World War had to be avoided at all costs The creation 
of the European Economic Community EEC in 1957 was only partly the result 
of these American pressuresit was also underpinned by a long tradition of 
panEuropean projects and utopias The EEC was also intended to overcome 
the practical limitations of nationally focussed social and economic regulation 
which had proven challenging for Western European governments during the 
1950s and 1960s In the 1990s after the fall of the Iron Curtain liberal democracy 
and Western market capitalism were adopted by the former communist states
