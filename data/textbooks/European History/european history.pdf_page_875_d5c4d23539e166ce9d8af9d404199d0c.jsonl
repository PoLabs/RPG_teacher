Kate Davison Erik Jacobs and Mnika Mtay
Introduction
The notion of culture was once defined narrowly in terms of great artwork 
performance literature and architecture However under the influence of 
history from below in the 1960s and 1970sand the anthropological and 
sociological approaches it borrowedculture underwent redefinition It came 
to stand for systems of meaning values and attitudes and the forms in which 
they were expressed whether spoken aloud written down performed or 
embodied in material objects With this broader understanding of culture 
historians were no longer confined to studying elites the study of popular 
culture was possible This chapter discusses how historians have applied 
this approach to the early modern period and surveys their key findings The 
chapter will then turn to the topic of print in more detail as an important source 
in the study of popular culture and the only phenomenon that approached 
the status of mass media in early modern Europe
Popular Culture
Among the most influential works in establishing the history of popular 
culture in early modern Europe was Peter Burkes Popular Culture in Early 
Modern Europe 1978 For Burke popular culture was that of the subordinate 
classesthose below the eliteand it was transmitted and expressed in market 
squares piazzas taverns and other communal spaces He defined popular 
culture in opposition to a learned tradition handed down through schools and 
universities in intellectual traditions of philosophy theology and scientific 
inquiry Exclude these from the picture of early modern culture and popular 
culture is what remains folksongs and folktales communal rituals devotional 
images and objects cheap print such as broadsides and chapbooks andmost 
importantly for Burkefestivals including seasonal occasions like Christmas
