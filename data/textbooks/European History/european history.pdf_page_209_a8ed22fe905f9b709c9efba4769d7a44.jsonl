Introduction
Interethnic relations and the complex relationships among states nations 
and minority populations underwent several changes in twentiethcentury 
Europe The First World War brought about the dissolution of empires on 
the continent the rearrangement of European borders and the emergence 
of entirely new states especially in the continents eastern half These 
geopolitical changes often thoroughly redefined the populations of European 
states as well as the possibilities for minorities within them Dictatorships 
and authoritarian regimes in the interwar period fostered racialised thinking 
and the persecution of ethnic and other minorities culminating in genocide 
and ethnic cleansing during and after the Second World War on a scale that 
would have been unimaginable a century earlier Even in the second half of 
the twentieth century discriminatory practices towards minorities continued 
and nationalist or separatist movements reemerged leading to periodic 
outbursts of violent interethnic conflicts The remainder of this chapter will 
examine the ambiguity of the term ethnicity and the changing relationships 
between majority and minority populations in Europe with a particular focus 
on the more complex situation in multiethnic regions of Central Eastern and 
southeastern Europe
