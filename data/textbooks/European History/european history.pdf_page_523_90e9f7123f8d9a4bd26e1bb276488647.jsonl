advocated the learning of Greek which then inspired Erasmus to create a 
trilingual college in Leuven in 1517 While humanism was firmly implemented 
in the sixteenth century it later became somewhat stifled in the seventeenth 
century The Dutch SchoolOrder of 1625 was meant to create a curriculum 
allowing mobility across the provincial borders of the United Provinces but 
such federative ideals proved no match for the competition between regional 
schools where masters opted for their own published books This was more a 
question of competition than of dynamic innovation 
Competition was also noticeable on a larger scale as rulers tightened 
their grip on the universities in their countries Universities also became 
more bureaucratic drawing up rules for examinations and becoming more 
streamlined in their organisation Newtonian natural science had largely 
replaced Aristotelian physics by the end of the seventeenth century and over 
the course of the eighteenth century natural science grew in importance at the 
expense of theology and of humanist topics taught traditionally at faculties 
of liberal arts such as history and rhetoric Philosophy as a whole and 
metaphysics in particular was maintained throughout the Enlightenment 
culminating in Kants plea for its primacy But universities were not centres 
of innovative ideas and lagged behind in their programming Whereas the 
sixteenth century had been the heyday for the growth of universities the 
number of students in Europe stabilised or even dropped in the seventeenth 
century Then in the first half of the eighteenth century registrations in 
southern universities started to increase again In France for example student 
numbers were on the rise particularly in law faculties while in most northern 
European institutions their numbers continued to drop In the second half 
of the eighteenth century numbers rose again all over the continent Lower 
classes however enjoyed fewer opportunities to enter the universities 
whereas the humanistic institutions of education had been relatively open to 
people from poorer backgrounds the universities of the eighteenth century 
were increasingly populated by students drawn from the aristocratic layers of 
society Overall the universities became more national in character 
As public administration tightened along national lines student mobility 
was constrained The mobility of pedagogical reformers such as the Dutch 
Erasmus the Bohemian Comenius and the Spanish Ruiz de Moros was 
facilitated by the universal use of Latin But during the Enlightenment the rise 
of the vernacular and the centralisation of states stifled student mobility the 
traditional study trip in which students hopped from one university to the 
other became a journey enjoyed only by aristocratic students
