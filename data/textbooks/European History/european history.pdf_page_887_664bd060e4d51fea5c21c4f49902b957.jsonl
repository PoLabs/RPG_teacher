methods most importantly the rotary press introduced in the 1840s and 
typography A decisive step in this last facet of newspaper production was the 
introduction of the socalled hot metal typesetting used in linotype machines 
Until then the preparation of a text for printing did not differ fundamentally 
from the methods used in Gutenbergs time each typeface had to be selected 
aligned and justified all by hand after use the typefaces were removed for 
reuse With the Linotype introduced in the 1880s the process was automated 
making typesetting six times faster 
The increased newspaper production was matched by a similar growth 
in demand for news Over the course of the century increased access to 
education often public education offered by the state led to mass literacy 
in the industrialising countries of the continent At the same time political 
censorship eased in many countries These developments allowed newspapers 
to take a central place in the European cultural landscape over the course of the 
nineteenth century Cheaply produced and cheaply soldfor half a penny in 
England and five centimes in Francepopular newspapers fitted neatly with

Not only text but also images penetrated the lives of millions of Europeans 
Before the nineteenth century most Europeans came across few images 
in their daily lives The pious could see religious paintings in Catholic or 
Orthodoxbut not Protestantchurches Some countries most notably the 
Dutch Republic had a popular painting culture But this was the exception as 
a rule paintings were commissioned by the church the nobility and economic 
elites The cost of image production kept their reach limited As a result visual 
culture was limited to a small segment of society 
This changed in the nineteenth century Shortly before it began 
lithographya method of printing images that used limestone or metal 
plateswas invented by the German author Alois Senefelder 17711834 In 
the beginning lithography was used primarily for printing sheet music and 
maps but technological advances spread its use to fine prints and posters
