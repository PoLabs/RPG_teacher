The second period is the emergence of the postindustrial city which is 
marked by urban deindustrialisation by the rise of the service economy by 
increased connectivity in travel migration and mass tourism as well as by 
the intensification of the interregional disparities and continental unification 
characterised by the decommunisation of Central and Eastern Europe starting 
in the last decade of the twentieth century 
In findesicle urban Europe rising social tensions required professional 
solutions which led to the institutionalisation of urban planning as an 
academic concern with the first course on it offered at the University of 
Liverpool in 1909 The successive paradigms of this discipline were marked 
by two major characteristics 1 they took it for granted that the proper 
urban design determined by a suitable ideology generated a principled urban 
society free from the social evil of uncontrolled capitalism 2 urban planning 
as a discipline was often playing catchup as its new schemes for reformed 
urban life were constantly being superseded or preempted by unexpected 
factors like rapidly changing technologies and fastevolving social conditions 
Consequently these unexpected or unconsidered factors such as automobiles 
individualisation commercialisation the growing significance of leisure time 
deindustrialisation etc could lead to the discreditation and the replacement 
of the precedent paradigms and to the reconstruction or degeneration of the 
urban landscape created by them 
The most significant movements of the first period of urban planning were
	
Garden Cities which offered an alternative at the turn of the twentieth 
century to overcrowded immoral and industrial neighbourhoods by 
proposing resettlement in remote greenbelts but later criticised as the 
predecessor of suburbanisation models and dormitory cities 
	
City Beautiful which was the twentiethcentury North American 
reception of nineteenthcentury European urban interventions 
with the purpose of grandiose political representation such as the 
reconstruction of Paris by GeorgesEugne Haussmann 18091891 
and the construction of the Viennese Ringstrasse which returned to 
Europe in the 1930s when totalitarian regimes applied its models to 
rebuild their capitals such as Nazi Berlin or Stalinist Moscow in order 
to impose their megalomaniac visions
	
Zoning and modernist urban planning a category of various 
movements united by their quest to establish an enduring equilibrium 
between various urban areas determined by their specific activities 
such as production services residence recreation etc but later 
criticised for having amplified unhealthy and individualistic car 
transport for segregating urban neighbourhoods from each other for
