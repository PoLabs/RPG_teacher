In line with their overall totalitarian agenda the Nazis sought control of all 
expression of culture and thought Both in the media and in the arts they 
attempted to purge all traces of liberal or Marxist values and any kind of 
critical progressive or pluralistic thinking These values and perspectives were 
indistinctly termed decadent Jewish Bolshevik or black On 4 February 
1933 Hitler persuaded President Paul von Hindenburg to sign an emergency 
decree Verordnung des Reichsprsidenten zum Schutze des Deutschen Volkes 
which authorised the state to prohibit publications or meetings that abused 
or treated official bodies or institutions with contempt and as a result of this 
decree many communist and social democratic newspapers were suppressed
On the other hand writers such as Friedrich Griese or Ina Seidel were 
distinguished novelists who participated in the nationalist literary movement 
during the Third Reich and who endeavoured to construct an idealised 
conception of the German spirit Creative work represented an opportunity 
for the Third Reich to unify the national community based on themes which 
found their main source of inspiration in the experience of war The press the 
radio cinema literature libraries the university and schools served to diffuse 
the PanGermanic ideal and brought the masses into line with the regime In 
1937 rural novels historical novels and novels set in the native landscape were 
bestsellers From 1939 onwards novels glorifying the initial struggles of the 
Nazi Party moved to the top of the list Despite this these lowquality novels 
were only momentarily successful and as a result of the exile of important 
communist liberal and Jewish writers German literature within the country 
itself suffered a decline in quality and diversity
In other European dictatorships such as those of Francisco Franco Spain 
19361975 or Antnio de Oliveira Salazar Portugal 19261974 censorship 
was also widely used Franco and Salazar believed that culture and the press 
should serve the national community and adapt to the official version of the 
facts and censorship had the goal of entirely obstructing subversive ideas that 
could breed dissent In Spain the Law of 22 April 1938which was in large 
part inspired by new fascist legislation in Italyestablished an a priori process 
for the censorship of books and newspapers On the other hand in Portugal 
the regime counted on Antnio Ferro as director of the National Propaganda 
Secretariat which was the organ par excellence for Salazar propaganda and 
censorship Texts of a political or social nature were forced to be submitted to 
prior censorship before publication
