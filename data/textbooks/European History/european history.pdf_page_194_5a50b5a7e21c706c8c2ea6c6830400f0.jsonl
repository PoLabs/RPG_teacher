monarchs The socalled Lapp Codicil an addendum to the Strmstad Treaty 
concluded in 1751 protected the nomadic lifestyle of Sami reindeer herders 
by recognising their right to cross this border in order to access pastures 
and other key resources even in times of war At the same time however 
the requirement that herders fixed their juridical subjecthood along with the 
subsequent hardening of the borders between Norway Sweden and Russia 
increased the pressure on them to assimilate to the majority populations and 
submit to the authority of the respective states
Conclusion
People living in the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were 
aware of the ethnic diversity of Europe even if what we today refer to as ethnic 
categories were more fluid at that time Ethnicity peoplehood and nation 
did not have the same political significance ascribed to them by nineteenth 
and twentiethcentury nationalism and different ethnic groups defined by 
geographic origins language cultural practices and religion coexisted in 
all European polities Of course such coexistence was not necessarily always 
peaceful and there were significant power asymmetries between different 
groups Especially marginalised minorities such as Jews and the Romani 
people were generally disadvantaged and abused On the other hand their 
identities as distinct groupsimposed from the outside by European majority 
populations as much as they were constructed from the inside by members 
of such communitiesdid at times afford them a degree of protection and 
autonomy especially when early modern authorities considered it expedient 
This model of relative communal autonomy with direct relations to the ruler 
was characteristic not only of PolandLithuania but also most other multi
ethnic polities To some extent this principle also extended to Europes 
indigenous peoples such as the Sami However the right of selfadministration 
also existed in tension with rulers attempts to increase their control over 
their subjects mobilise their resources and homogenise their beliefs In this 
sense therefore interethnic relations in early modern Europe were precarious 
unstable and subject to change over time They remained volatile after 1800 
when nationalist and racist ideologies took early modern scientific theories 
of race to the extreme in order to justify exploitation colonisation violence 
and even extermination in Europe and overseas Long before that Europes 
deepening entanglements with lands and peoples beyond its shores had 
already given rise to a growing presence of people from distant countries
the result of conquest enslavement and religious missions In the sixteenth 
century for instance Sevilla was home to a sizeable community of people of
