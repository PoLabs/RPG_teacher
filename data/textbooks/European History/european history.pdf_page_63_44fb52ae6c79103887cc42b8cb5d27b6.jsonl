12 BORDERS
43
the clear marking of boundaries was not a model for other European states as 
fortifications and stationed troops turned out to be very expensive
The early modern period finally saw efforts to unify state tax and customs 
borders Alongside France Austria and even Russia also established this form 
of border in the eighteenth century This process of merging of different border 
types signified a huge step towards the unification of states with longlasting 
effects for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries At the same time with the 
imposition of these unified borders came the imposition of cultural borders 
a process involving the standardisation of languages and homogenisation of 
cultures
Conclusion
The meaning of borders underwent an important shift over the course of the 
early modern period and particularly in the eighteenth century Relatively 
fluid borders between political entities became more sharply defined over this 
period in relation to the strengthening and centralisation of the state The role 
of borders for the state was also transformed especially with respect to tax and 
custom collection Internal borders were dissolved or weakened as part of the 
same processes At the same time especially on the eastern and southeastern 
frontier of Europe frontiers remained shifting and permeable serving as both 
physical and symbolic demarcations of the imagined community of Europe 
and the Western Christian world and as a site of extensive cultural transfers 
and interchanges
