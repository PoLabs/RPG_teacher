perished Elsewhere in Europe people were also forced to leave their homes 
or flee from violence In 1939 some 500000 Spaniards fled to France after the 
collapse of the Spanish Republic the Retirada while some 100000 Greeks 
left Thrace and Macedonia after it was occupied by Bulgaria Italian expansion 
forced Serbs Hungarians Croatians and Sloveniansperhaps 500000 people 
in totalout of parts of the SouthEast of Europe
The number of people forced to leave their home increased exponentially 
after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union The German invasion of the 
Soviet Union constituted the start of the Holocaust the destruction of the Jews 
of Europe when the largescale and lethal violence against Jews in occupied 
Poland transformed into a systematic attempt to remove and physically 
extinguish all Jews present in Nazioccupied Europe While Jews were 
deported some 75 million peopleGerman nationals and forced labourers 
mainly from Poland and the Soviet Union but also over two million from 
Western Europewere brought into the prewar realm of the German Empire 
Moreover the German Army interned some 57 million Soviet POWs of whom 
about half were starved to death or shot 
At the same time the Soviets held some three million German POWs of 
whom some 380000 died in custody They were only a small portion of the 
people on Soviet territory who were subject to deportation or forced migration 
This had started as early as the 1930s with dekulakisation which targeted 
some two million people between 1929 and 1932 the largescale purges of the 
1930s and the Holodomor or Great Famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932
1933 all of which devastated the lives of millions of people 
As was the case at the end of the First World War the end of the Second 
World War saw another wave of forced migrations While the Soviets had 
gladly expelled political enemies in 1917 they now insisted on the repatriation 
of all Russians in the West not only to bring back Soviet citizens but also to 
prevent the creation of foreign opposition to the Soviet regime as had emerged 
after the First World War The largest group consisted of Russian POWs in 
German custody Before being allowed to resettle they were all assessed for 
political reliability and productive capacity As a result some fifteen percent of 
four million were directly sent through to Soviet forced labour camps creating 
fear and opposition of the last half a million Soviet POWs who in 1946 resisted 
repatriation
They supplemented a much larger group of around eleven million displaced 
persons DPs most of whom remained in Germany now occupied by the 
Allied Forces Apart from POWs this group consisted of forced labourers 
Jews and political prisoners interned in concentration camps Many of them 
returned home before the end of 1945 yet the 250000 Jewish DPs from all 
over Europe who had survived the German camps had little to return to as in
