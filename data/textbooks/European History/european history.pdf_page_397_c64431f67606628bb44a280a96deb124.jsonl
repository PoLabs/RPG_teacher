34 PEACE AND CONFLICT
377
These moments of conflict appear closely linked to the proliferation of 
schemes for perpetual peace with the publication of such visions peaking 
at turbulent moments such as 1800 18141815 or 1830 In Italy between 
1795 and 1800 at least 140 peace projects were proposed The irenic ideal 
of perpetual peace was a longstanding medieval tradition Most of its 
formulations advocated the establishment of world governance through 
supranational institutions or the federation of the continent as a means to 
achieve the ultimate goal of a definitive universal peace This debate was 
reformulated by lateEnlightenment figures such as the Abb de SaintPierre 
1712 Rousseau 1761 Jeremy Bentham 1789 Kant 1795 or Grres 1797 
who withdrew the idea of a universal monarchy or a league of kings and 
opted for a federal and republican version in the form of a league of peoples 
ruled by a representative assembly of nations
This intellectual tradition was further developed at the beginning of the 
nineteenth century but was now shaped by Bonapartist predominance The 
Italian Piattoli and the Polish Czartoryski 18031805 under the auspices of 
the Tsar Alexander opted for a BritishRussian alliance to ensure a system 
respectful of liberal pacifist and national principles against Napoleonic 
expansionism The French JJB Gondon 1807 conversely proposed a 
supranational government for Europe as a means of achieving civil peace and 
prosperity while the Italian G Franci still conceived in 1814 of a continent 
divided into four large and wellbalanced empires harmoniously coexisting 
The real turning point was the project On the Reorganisation of European Society 
by the Count of SaintSimon written in 1814 during the preparations for the 
Congress of Vienna In this work SaintSimon aimed to give an answer to 
the greatest question of the moment the European peace and regeneration 
His aim was to overcome the Westphalian system which in his opinion was 
responsible for the state of war throughout the continent The medieval and 
Enlightenment genre of writings on Perpetual Peace was thus still very popular 
in the nineteenth century adapting to new liberal or socialist ideas widening 
the European space in response to the socalled Eastern Question relating 
to the problems caused by the instability and disintegration of the Ottoman 
Empire and proposing worldwide institutions parliaments international 
courts to mediate in disputes between nations while still respecting national 
identities and aiming to ensure within the new commercial and industrial 
society the end goal of international peace
Towards the middle of the century these utopian projects crystallised in 
the emergence of social movements for peace It was certainly no coincidence 
that the first peace organisations were founded in Europe after the Napoleonic 
Wars for example the London Peace Society began its work in 1816 and 
held the first momentous International Peace Congress in 1843 Middleclass
