centurythough even in these regions nuclear families based on a mother 
father and their children were the most common pattern in cities The idea 
of a European family model has also been questioned by scholars who have 
argued that households based on the nuclear family were not necessarily the 
norm in the past despite popular memory Indeed a number of scholars have 
highlighted the role of single mothers and patchwork families during this 
period not least because of spousal abandonment and widowhood in an era 
of high mortality and difficult divorce laws 
Nonetheless despite these variations within the history of the family and 
household there were several common trends during this period including 
the predominance of patriarchythe rule of the father which determined the 
legal status of women and children as well as how households were generally 
governed Moreover in this era of mass migration and imperial expansion 
frequent encounters with others of various kinds helped to solidify certain 
ideas about what families and households should look like in particular 
countries or societies
This chapter draws attention to several facets of these issues including the 
vast socioeconomic and legal changes affecting marriage and the family as 
well as cultural redefinitions of the family and the often moralising discourses 
surrounding sexuality which likewise shaped the household and the family 
in modern Europe
