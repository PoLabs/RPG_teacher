Introduction
Ethnicity or ethnic group as with similar collective nouns is a commonly 
used but fuzzy concept Most dictionary definitions stress that ethnicity

the twentieth century The concepts that circulated at the time varied greatly 
across time and geographical space Depending on author and historical

nationalities or races These concepts were sometimes used interchangeably 
in other contexts they designated very specific historical realities In some 
cases they were mere ethnographic terms in others they acquired political 
meaning
Ethnic groups had of course existed before the nineteenth century and 
were mentioned by travellers chroniclers historians and governmental 
officials What the nineteenth century introduced was a sharpening and 
sometimes artificial creation of lines of demarcation between various ethnic 
groups across Europe and their reconceptualisation as nations which came 
to be regarded as the legitimate basis for states The emergent disciplines of 
folklore collection ethnography philology and statistics processed group 
differences and came up with distinct categories of peoples Thus they also 
served as instruments of codification regularisation and unification

compact while the greatest amount of ethnic fragmentation was to be found in
