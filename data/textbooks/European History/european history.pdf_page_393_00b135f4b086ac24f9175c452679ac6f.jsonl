Introduction
There is a lingering debate among historians as to whether the long nineteenth 
centurythe period between 1789 and 1918should be considered an age

Napoleonic Wars which came to an end in 1815 and which had devastating 
consequences for the whole of Europe Additional wars throughout the 
century included a series of regional conflicts andat the very endthe 
beginning of the First World War But the era also witnessed the development 
of collaborative institutions and the idea of the Concert of Europe which 
helped to contain violent conflicts The nineteenth century also gave birth

question of whether the nineteenth century was particularly violent or 
particularly peaceful depends on where one looks In their colonial empires 
the European powers were anything but peaceful There they exercised brutal 
violence against indigenous populations and deprived the colonised territories 
of their resources The European powers were also indirectly involved in the 
American Civil War 18611865 which was extremely costly The nineteenth 
century saw both the birth of industrial warfare and has nonetheless often 
been characterised as an epoch of peace and prosperity How can we explain 
these two phenomena and their apparent contradiction
