would deteriorate rapidly In 1852 Robert Angus Smith 18171884 a 
Scottish chemist living in Manchester one of the worlds first industrial cities 
identified the role of the burning of sulphurrich coal in the emergence of acid 
rain By the end of the nineteenth century Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius 
18591927 shifted discussion of the problem from a regional to a global scale 
when he theorised the threat of global warming induced by growing levels of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
Rapid 
development 
from 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
onwards 
in 
industrialisation urbanisation population growth and the exploitation of 
resources especially the massive use of coal launched the beginning of a new 
geological era called the Anthropocene Already in 1873 geologist Antonio 
Stoppani 18241891 introduced the idea of an anthropozoic era in which 
humankind started influencing the biospheres biological geological and 
atmospheric processes In 2000 following Stoppanis idea chemists Paul 
Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer started an international discussion about the 
notion that humankind was effectively a geological factor which now altered 
the relatively stable environmental conditions of the Holocene
Rise of the Conservation Movement
By the end of the nineteenth century rapid environmental changes led 
to the idea that the natural world was a fragile and interconnected system 
that needed protection It was in the European colonies overseas before the 
environmental consequences of the industrial revolution became visible 
at home that scientists from Britain France and Germany for the first time 
experienced how human expansion and activities degraded a natural beauty 
that they equated with the biblical Eden Tropical islands under colonial rule 
such as Mauritius and Saint Helena appealed to European fantasies about 
unspoiled and unadulterated nature vividly depicted in romantic literature 
and art Because of their surveyable size tropical islands provided sites ideally 
suited for botanical research and it was here that ideas about ecological 
connections were first envisioned 
It was in the colonies too with the economic interests of the metropole and 
local hunting interests in mind that enlightened administrators applied forest 
and soil conservation measures for the first time As part of an imperial policy 
protecting timber for example the British colonial regime in India established 
forest reserves in the 1850s At the end of the century in some provinces more 
than thirty percent of forest land was formally protected In a similar vein the 
British colonial administration in the Cape Colony in presentday South Africa 
enacted legislation protecting forests in 1859 and wildlife in hunting reserves 
in 1886
