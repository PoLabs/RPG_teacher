24 INEQUALITIES
235
Class or status gender and race inequalities overlapped and intersected 
within this essentially unequal system Gender inequality can be documented 
for the whole register of human activities from prehistoric times to the 
present Many different past European cultures had constructed gender 
relations hierarchically considering the male element not only stronger but 
more strongly associated with public activities and culture while depicting 
the feminine element as private and linked to the realm of the natural But 
even while the early modern era inherited some structural elements of gender 
inequality from preceding periods the general trend in Europe between the 
sixteenth and eighteenth centuries in fact shows some deterioration in the 
public involvement of women Women continued to have virtually no access to 
public office to representative bodies or to municipal government Moreover 
some medieval examples of allfemale guilds tended to disappear as did the 
formal participation of women in guilds and their governing bodies Changes 
in the production system during the early modern age did not benefit women 
either New capitalist forms of production including manufactures inside 
households relied notably on the work of women or children but neither 
received a separate income or recognition for such work Women had more 
difficulties when it came to travelling starting a business or working for wages 
and were therefore more likely to work under the authority of a household 
either as wives or domestic servants The scarce visibility of womens work 
was aggravated by the demands of caring and domestic occupations such as 
housekeeping 
Researchers such as Maria gren have shown that in several areas of 
Europe married couples were better off in all types of business Others 
have emphasised the particular position of widows a peculiar status that 
offered access to otherwise restricted spheres of action such as shopkeeping 
or guilds and which placed women at the head of family units As already 
mentioned in early modern Europe inequalities in social provenance and class 
overlapped with gender and racial inequalities Therefore queens and other 
powerful noblewomen were often better positioned to assert their power 
administer their properties and conduct politics Despite some difficulties 
aristocratic women were involved in informal power networks of diplomacy 
and gift exchange family alliances and strategies or they influenced politics 
from the inside of powerful convents for instance However nonaristocratic 
women also developed strategies of agency within the cracks of the system 
negotiating their access to motherhood remarrying contributing to business 
from shops to artisan production participating in colonial exploits and 
producing cultural works from painting to literature
