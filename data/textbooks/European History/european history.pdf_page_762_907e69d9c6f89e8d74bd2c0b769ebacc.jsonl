overlap first of all in their rationalist expectations that a wellordered and just 
society was feasible but also in the social composition of these movements 
protagonists and supporters aspiring middleclass people and selfreliant 
skilled workers in crafts trade or the liberal professions Utopian socialists 
also differed from the liberals however in the sense that they focused less on 
equal political rights and argued instead that it was primarily the organisation 
of production and the distribution of wealth that formed the most important 
source of injustice The utopias they sketched were proposalsand in some 
cases also realworld experimentsfor communal forms of production and 
solidaristic modes of distribution However for some socialists realising 
social justice in this way was a chimera following the analysis of Franois 
Nol Babeuf 17601797 also known as Gracchus Babeuf and other French 
revolutionaries some expected that leading by utopian example would never 
convince the propertyowning classes to share their wealth Nor would the 
owners of the means of production be persuaded to cease exploiting their 
workers as nothing more than a tool to maximise their profit This could only 
change by way of a popular uprising in which the masses would take their 
rightful share by force 
All of this utopian and populist optimism of the early socialists was 
delusional according to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels They argued that the 
history of societies was determined not by ideas or ideals but by the objective 
relations of production the conflict between social classes programmed 
into the basic structure of society due to unavoidable tension between the 
bourgeois owners of the means of production capital and those who had 
no other property than their own physical power to sell labour This class 
conflict had its own logic to follow from increasing immiseration of the 
workers to the seizure of state power to expropriate the bourgeoisie as an 
intermediate phase towards real freedom for all under communism In this 
context ideas were nothing but the expression of these conflicted relations of 
production and the dominant ideology was thus a legitimation of the interests 
of the ruling class In this context ideology was no longer a positive projection 
of a future just society but an idealist hindrance to the inevitable coming of 
a communist society and the opposite of the scientific nature Marx and his 
followers claimed for his ideas
The advent of Marxism in the 1840s and its development into the creed of 
the socialist movement and mass parties that were to emergein the 1860s 
in Germany later in other parts of Europewas as impressive as it was 
problematic In the logic of scientific Marxism there was no active role to play 
for the organisations of workers the realisation of communism just had to wait 
for the objectively right moment in the history of the class conflict If Marxism 
had a role to play as an ideology it was only to prepare the working class for
