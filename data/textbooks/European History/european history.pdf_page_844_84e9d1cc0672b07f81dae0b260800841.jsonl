chores Yet so welltreated were Utopian bondsmen and women that peoples 
from neighbouring countries often requested to be enslaved as their lives were 
healthier safer and more orderly than the lives of free peoples elsewhere
Although More originally intended his text for a humanist and Latinate 
transnational republic of letters a brief outline of its early publishing history 
shows its growing appeal across Europe Three Latin versions appeared 
between 1516 and 1518 including the original Leuven copy published by 
Dirk Martens and the famous Basel edition published by the humanist printer 
Johann Froben The first vernacular translation of Utopiathough only Book 
IIwas published in German in 1524 as well as in Basel and an Italian 
version of both Books I and II was published in Venice by Ortensio Lando 
in 1548 A full French translation was published in Paris in 1550 an English 
version appeared in London in 1551 and a Dutch translation was published 
in Antwerp in 1553 Although a Spanish version was not published until 1637 
a Spanish manuscript copythe Gondomar translationwas circulating as 
early as 1535 However it was not until the nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries that the text appeared in the vernaculars of Eastern Europe and 
Russia 
Each of these translations created a new vernacularised version of Utopia 
that was unique in terms of its formatting wording interpretative emphases 
as well as the cultural and political context into which it was introduced 
They also demonstrate how the relatively esoteric knowledge of Europes 
educated elites began over the course of the sixteenth century to be more 
widely disseminated socially and used practically To take just one example of 
this process the historian Jennifer Bishop has meticulously reconstructed the 
circumstances leading to the first translation of Utopia into English in 1551 The 
translator was Ralph Robinson a welleducated clerk touting for employment 
in London in the early 1550s His patrons were a group of London merchants and 
master craftsmen deeply involved in implementing a reformation of religion 
and government through their participation in guild city and parliamentary 
politics Although written by a Catholic martyr Utopia appeared to offer plenty 
of insights into what a reformed Protestant polity might look like for example 
in its commitment to enlightened political counsel its prioritisation of the 
common weal and happiness and its lauding of the participatory nature of 
Utopias political structures which bore uncanny resemblances to Londons 
civic institutions While these Londoners were by no means attracted to the 
communism practiced by Utopians they nevertheless found the principles of 
social responsibility and commonwealth espoused by More appealing and a 
useful mirror through which to view contemporary society Thereafter new 
translations of Utopia in different languages tended to coincide with moments 
of political crisis and on occasion revolutionary opportunity
