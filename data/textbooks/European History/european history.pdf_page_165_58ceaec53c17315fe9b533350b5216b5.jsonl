inheritance claims But administrative records were not neutral instruments 
as they were also used for nationbuilding and enforcing social structures 
Registration indicated that the state recognised the existence of individuals 
and wanted to improve or regulate their daily lives yet these documents 
were shaped by a very specific group of men in terms of affluence and social 
standing meaning that recognition followed normative patterns that were 
dominant at the time For example forms of human bondage or slavery in 
the colonies excluded certain groups of people from registration enabling 
structural dehumanisation There was generally little interest in indexing 
female occupations after marriage since married women were not supposed 
to work in the public sphere nor was there much attention to the agrarian 
division of labour from administrations that were mainly interested in 
processes of industrialisation From our contemporary perspective we see 
this lack of registration as a form of marginalisation since aspects of lives 
remained structurally unknown and out of view In order to make accurate re
constructions of the past it is therefore imperative to understand the historical 
perspectives and concomitant biases that are ingrained in each form of civil 
registration
