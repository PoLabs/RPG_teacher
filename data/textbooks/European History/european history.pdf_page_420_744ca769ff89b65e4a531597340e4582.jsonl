revolts exploded during the seventeenth century it was not until the second half 
of the eighteenth century that major uprisings broke out in opposition against 
this system In Russia more than 10000 insurgents led by Emelyan Pugachev 
17421775 a Cossack chief took over an immense territory stretching from 
the Urals to the Don for two years 17731774 At the same time several great 
serf revolts broke out in the Habsburg Empire In January 1775 more than 
10000 peasants asking for bread and an end to serfdom destroyed castles in 
the countryside of Bohemia but failed to take Prague In the autumn of 1784 
in Transylvania Romanian serfs led by the serf carpenter Vasile Ursu Nicola 
17411785 called Horea rose against their Hungarian and German lords 
and burned down or looted 230 castles demanding an end to serfdom and the 
division of land Though the government of Emperor Joseph II 17411790 
initially suppressed these rebellions by force a few years later it relieved the 
status of serfs 
The early modern states increasing fiscal claims to fund the military were 
rejected in the countryside in the name of local liberties Whereas in Spain and 
Italy the great antifiscal revolts were mainly urban in France the countryside 
took the lead The French peasant wars of 16301660 called neither social 
hierarchies nor the monarchical regime into question On the contrary they 
mobilised local solidarity between the nobility the landlords and the peasantry 
against the tax abuses of the Kings bad advisers Their repression by the 
absolutist state gave rise to new tactics such as bad will from day to day 
in other words aggression towards tax agents refusal of payment and so on 
as well as localised and often ephemeral riots that the state found difficult to 
control in France alone 799 riots between 1701 and 1730
The rise of agrarian individualism and economic liberalism in the 
countryside was another source of contestation Think of the enclosures in 
England and at the end of the eighteenth century the clearances in the Scottish 
Highlands In the spring of 1607 a revolt erupted in the English Midlands 
with freeholders destroying the hedges of large estates and reopening the 
land During the English Civil War 16421651 the number of revolts against 
enclosures exploded In the eighteenth century Parliament passed legislation 
allowing common lands to become privately owned without the consent of 
rural communities Rural people turned to clandestine resistance strategies 
poaching in the hunting reserves attacks on the lords properties The Black 
Acts 17231724 imposed the death penalty on such acts of opposition 
Nevertheless radical ideas of egalitarianism and Christian economy against 
liberalism labelled by historian EP Thompson as the moral economy 
became very popular A similar resistance to the new liberal economy also 
emerged in Spain with the Motn de Esquilache in 1766 and in the Parisian Flour 
War of 1775 In both cases urban and rural people rose against the freedom
