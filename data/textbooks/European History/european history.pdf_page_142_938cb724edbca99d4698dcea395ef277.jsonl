natural resources and promoting true development In this sense Africa has 
become an emblematic example of the contradictions that exist in Western 
discourses on environmental preservation development and the defence of 
human rights In reality these imaginaries are ways of deconstructing the 
dignity of the other and upon closer analysis what becomes evident is that 
projects disguised as humanitarian initiatives or other ethical justifications 
are in effect acts of violence towards the other
The Middle East 
Unlike Africa there is much uncertainty today as to where one can 
geographically locate the Middle East and how we might think of the societies 
that inhabit it What is widely accepted is that the term Middle East was 
invented by AngloAmerican strategists as a semantic and geographical 
category at the turn of the twentieth century possibly in relation to the 
Boxer War 18991901 in China which constituted the socalled Far Eastern 
Question for Western European actors In other words from its inception the 
term Middle East described an entire region through geographical reference 
to Europe It was defined through a Eurocentric perception of the globe 
Politically culturally and economically it also helped identify Europe through 
a process of otheringcategorising and hierarchising groups of people often 
implicitly but sometimes disdainfully overtlywhich superficially associated 
the West with progress civilisation and development and the Middle East 
with the binary opposites of those categories 
The term Middle East thus symbolised how a handful of leadingedge 
Western European empires had assumed managerial responsibilities to 
govern the world redraw its maps and define the inhabitants of its diverse 
parts At the same time this region proved to be an indispensable source of the 
most important energy resource in the twentieth century oil 
At the end of the First World War the sevenhundredyearold Ottoman 
Empire was partitioned by Western European empires in an attempt to secure 
their strategic and economic interests since oil had proved to be a viral 
strategic weapon The new states in the Levant and Mesopotamia founded out 
of the ashes of the sultans empire were placed under the mandate of Britain 
and France which also controlled the oil resources of the region 
The end of the Second World War and the ensuing decolonisation 
process coincided with the foundation of Israel and a period of rising Arab 
nationalism coups dtat alongside attempts at nationalising the oil industries 
In the eventful and fateful history of this region we can discern at least two 
turning points where European othering of the Middle East is concerned The 
first of these was the Suez Crisis of 1956 The desire of Egyptian President
