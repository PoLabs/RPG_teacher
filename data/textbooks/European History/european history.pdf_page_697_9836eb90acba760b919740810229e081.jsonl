socialist politicians only briefly participated in bourgeois government In 
Germany with the biggest labour movements in Europe workingclass 
organisations were strong but due to the political system only had limited 
influence In Russia socialists continued to be persecuted At the same time 
throughout the nineteenth century an integration process occurred in which 
labour movements became much more closely attached to their nation states 
gained influence on the municipal level and helped to improve the economic
social situation of the working class
Conclusion
The composition and character of European labour markets changed 
drastically during the nineteenth century as a result of increasing agricultural 
productivity and industrialisation The expanding industrial and service 
sectors absorbed large parts of the agricultural labour force and wage labour 
as opposed to selfemployment became increasingly important Initially 
these developments had a negative impact on workingclass people who more 
often than not lived in unhealthy houses worked in dangerous places and 
did all of this without any financial protection against misfortune During 
the second half of the nineteenth century labourers all over Europe started to 
organise themselves into labour unions and eventually managed to influence 
government policies which ultimately resulted in protective legislation and 
increasing social welfare systems
