31 STATEBUILDING AND NATIONALISM
287
The breakup of empires however did not automatically reveal geographical 
units that could be directly shaped into states Many regions were ethnically 
mixed and this created tensions between different nationalist groups vying 
for political control of the same territories Nevertheless following the 
disintegration of the Russian Empire several new states emerged in Central 
and Eastern Europe Finland Lithuania Latvia Estonia and Poland A short
lived Ukrainian state also existed during the Russian Revolution The end of 
the Habsburg Monarchy paved the way to full sovereignty for Czechoslovakia 
and Hungary with Austria becoming an independent republic Serbia unified 
with Montenegro and obtained the former Austrian and Hungarian territories 
of Slovenia Croatia and BosniaHerzegovina together forming the Kingdom 
of Yugoslavia In overseeing the drawing of these new borders geostrategic 
and political considerations often turned out to be more important than the 
ideal of an ethnically homogeneous nationstate After all Germany had 
to be curtailed and the Bolshevik threat contained or so the Allied powers 
believed As a result when the dust settled on the new constellation of Europe 
32 million people found themselves as ethnic minorities in nationstates as 
opposed to the 50 million who had lived as minorities in imperial settings 
before 1914 Amounting to one third of the population of Central and Eastern 
Europe these groups now tended to have fewer rights than before 
In this context it is pertinent to draw a clear distinction between ethnic 
minorities and the closely related yet essentially different concept of diaspora 
Both minorities and diaspora communities are considered part of the nation 
The difference between them is the way in which each group found themselves 
outside the motherland Diasporas are formed following dispersed migration 
from a real or imagined mother country due to historical cataclysms such as 
war famine persecution or basic economic necessity Ethnic minorities mostly 
gain their status as a result of border alterations Jews Armenians Greeks 
Italians and Irish are considered examples of classic diaspora peoples 
Romani Sinti and other traveller communities could also be counted in this 
category even though they do not have the same attachment to an ancestral 
homeland 
As for ethnic minorities in the new nationstates of the early twentieth 
century the relations between these communities were aggravated by one 
of the intellectual innovations of the modern period racial science Partially 
developed in the context of European colonialism in Africa Asia and Latin 
America the scientification of racism provided existing racial prejudices with 
a veneer of legitimacy As a result racism came to codefine intraEuropean 
dynamics as well Defining who was to be counted as a member of an ethnic 
community had been challenging as neither nation nor race were grounded in 
fact Perceived differences between peoples which now seemed to be proven
