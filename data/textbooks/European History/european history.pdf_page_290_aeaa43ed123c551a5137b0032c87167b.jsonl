elected the Court of Aldermen that ruled the City of London Petitioning 
was another generally accepted way to alert authorities to not only private

legislation was copied verbatim from guild petitions The early stages of the 
Civil War in England were accompanied by mass petitions in London some 
collecting as many as 15000 signatures In many Italian cities neighbourhood 
organisations provided social cohesion and thus political influence to the 
civic community Civic militias another common feature of urban life of the 
period provided additional muscle to the community of citizens During the 
Reformation the Dutch Revolt and the English Civil War these organisations 
helped revolutionary regimes to power Such institutions are not so well
documented in the countryside but villages too seem to have had significant 
scope to regulate their own affairs and this involved the participation of 
substantial numbers of villagers participating in their own governance 
Women did participate in some of these local corporate institutions but only 
to a limited extent their participation in the political realm would remain very 
circumscribed until well into the twentieth century though some European 
monarchies allowed women to succeed to the throne under certain conditions 
and even in the twentyfirst century many European countries are yet to have 
their first female prime minister or head of state
