Women were granted the vote in Russia in 1917 and in Britain Germany 
and Austria in 1918 The framing of suffrage as a reward for womens 
exercise of patriotic duty helps us make sense of why even some conservative 
governments supported womens suffrage legislation In 1928 when British 
women were granted the vote on the same terms as men the legislation 
dubbed the Flappers Vote the Conservative Party was in power Women 
in Spain had to wait until 1931 for the vote those in France until 1944 and 
elsewhere even longer 1945 in Italy 1952 in Greece 1971 in Switzerland and 
finally 1976 in Portugal
With the overthrow of democracies by dictatorships during the interwar 
years however the rights of citizenship could just as easily be withdrawn 
showing the cyclical pattern of womens emancipation For example in the 
Weimar Republic there were high turnouts of women voters at elections and 
by 1932 112 women had been elected to the Reichstag Under the Nazi regime 
women were divested of these rights and representation The Nazis had only 
contempt for feminism depriving women of their rights and rewarding them 
instead for their prolific motherhood
The communist regimes boasted of achieving gender equalityand it 
was indeed true that millions of women entered the labour market because 
extensive industrialisation demanded a larger workforce While state 
propaganda promoted gender equality in every field an example being the 
field of education policy towards women often encountered resistance based 
on traditional gender and family ideologies inherited from the semifeudal 
past in which women were prevented from being placed on an equal footing 
with men Nurseries kindergartens and evening schools however did indeed 
help socialise housework and childcare and they were available to almost 
everybody in the 1970s and 1980s
The wave model for the feminist movement applies to many Western 
European countries The first wave crested from the turn of the century to 
the First World War when women agitated to have the grossest sexual 
inequalities addressed voting rights property rights and access to education 
and to the professions In a period of relative decline of feminism advances 
were nonetheless made at the national and international level and women 
made their voices heard at the League of Nations between the wars and at the 
United Nations after the Second World War
The second wave of feminism the womens liberation movement came in 
the late 1960s and through the 1970s emerging fromand often in reaction 
tothe sexism still embedded in radical and student politics and civil rights 
campaigns In turn campaigns for gay liberation calling for decriminalisation 
and the end of the stigmatisation of homosexuality were part of this moment 
of permissiveness and progressive ideas represented by a generation of baby
