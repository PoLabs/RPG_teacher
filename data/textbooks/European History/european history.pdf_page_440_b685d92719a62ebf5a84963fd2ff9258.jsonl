Protest Movements in Western and Northern Europe after 
1945 
In Western Europe after 1945 warweary citizens were initially more concerned 
with economic reconstruction than political protest Postwar democracies 
combined elements of classic liberalism with economic planning trade 
union representation and welfare state measures This alleviated some of the 
economic grievances that had fuelled protest in earlier periods and facilitated 
the consolidation of democratic institutions As a result protest became less 
common and more muted during the first decade of the postwar era
However postwar Europe was in many ways still at war both within and 
beyond the continent Like other empires France resisted decolonisation and 
the Algerian War of Independence 19541962 gave rise to largescale strikes 
by Algerian workers in France soldiers protests against conscription and 
underground organising on the right as well as the left As the Cold War took 
hold citizens from Britain to West Germany demonstrated against nuclear 
weapons backed up by the moral authority of famous intellectuals like Albert 
Einstein and Bertrand Russell By the beginning of the 1960s antiimperialism 
and opposition to the Cold War had become key elements of a revitalised 
transatlantic New Left
The New Left grew in part from disenchantment with the limits of postwar 
representative democracy dominated in most countries by conservatives who 
remained in power for decades for example until 1969 in West Germany 1974 
in France and 1981 in Italy However many New Leftists were also repelled 
by Soviet communism especially after the 1956 invasion of Hungary Rejecting 
both Cold War options they advocated participatory democracy instead 
Young people born after the Second World War were more acutely aware than 
their parents of how freedom often failed to live up to its promises initially 
small protests on matters ranging from sexual norms to the Vietnam War all 
encountered harsh repression throughout the 1960s
Even under liberal democracy police violence was a major catalyst of 
protest After police killed a demonstrator in West Berlin in June 1967 the 
West German student movement radicalised In May 1968 police repression 
of smallscale student protests in Paris quickly led to a general strike among 
workers across France Demonstrations in one place frequently inspired 
protests elsewhere The issues at stake differed from one country to the next 
but protesters readily identified with one another and borrowed tactics from 
abroad creating the appearance of a worldwide revolt When these dramatic 
protests seemingly failed to lead to revolutionary change many activists 
directed their political energies elsewhere
