Introduction
The concept of Europe while firmly embedded in everyday images and 
language has always been uncertain and imprecise It has resisted clearcut 
definitions developing through time and acquiring specific meanings in given 
places and at certain historical moments But it was during the early modern 
period that the idea of Europe became more solid and stable in the minds of 
those inhabiting the region Acquiring a concrete definition its inhabitants 
accepted it as real and objectively existing being mostly defined from within 
rather than from without Even though comparisons with others are crucial 
for selfdefinition equally important was the conscious and unconscious 
search for common traits by those who constructed the imagethe concept 
of Europe
The effort to grasp the supposedly shared essence of Europe was 
complicated by the fact that it was approached from several different angles 
In the following text three principal ways of conceptualising Europe are 
briefly outlined first Europe as a geographical social political and economic 
reality second Europe as a cognitive order of political religious and cultural 
ideas and third Europe as a named entity transmitted and discussed through 
representation in text and image To be sure distinguishing between these 
different ways of conceptualising Europe does not imply that these aspects 
can be studied in isolationthey are all intrinsically entangled
