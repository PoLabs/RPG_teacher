those of the Molinism of the Jesuit Luis de Molina 15351600 After a fierce 
controversy Pope Innocent X 15741655 in 1653 condemned Jansenism as 
a heresy Within Calvinism itself the roles of grace and free will continued 
to be debated A controversy between the two Leiden theologians Franciscus 
Gomarus 15631641 and Jacobus Arminius 15601609 led to a public crisis 
that brought the young Dutch Republic to the brink of civil war precisely 
during the period of the Twelve Years Truce 16091621 Arminianism 
or Remonstrantism was condemned by the Reformed Church during the 
international Synod of Dordrecht 16181619 The canons of this Synod 
together with Calvins Institutions and the Heidelberg Catechism 1566 
effectively functioned as the new collection of articles of faith for the Dutch 
Reformed Church although even then debates continued to rage
On the other side of the Channel meanwhile the English Civil War 
16401649 had seen a variety of politicalreligious factions pitched against 
one another in diverging opinions about the role of bishops in the Church 
of England Scottish Presbyterians and English Protestants later labelled 
Puritans resisted the Arminianism of the Archbishop of Canterbury William 
Laud 15731645 Other dissenters formed a colourful range of critical 
thinkers including Quakers Baptists Congregationalists and Brownists The 
distinctions were not clear cut and some of these currents were rather fleeting 
Even in these small communities splits arose the English Mathew Slade 
15691628 originally a Brownist went on to form an English community 
of the Dutch Reformed Church in parallel to the Frenchspeaking Walloon 
Churches The latter were frequented largely by Huguenots Protestants 
who had fled France and the southern Low Countries and who set up their 
own LatinFrench communication networks all across the northern part of 
Europe These migrants contributed to the scholarly institutionalisation of 
Protestantism via professorships the book industry and journalism Later 
generations in the Huguenot diaspora assimilated into the regional reformed 
churches
The Huguenots were not the only religious group to go into exile and 
spread out over early modern Europe Sephardic Jews moved out of the 
Iberian Peninsula fleeing religious persecution and setting up communities 
in London and Amsterdam where they met with Ashkenazi Jews Creating 
vast economic and intellectual networks Jews occupied important positions in 
such port cities as Livorno and Amsterdam whereas Vilnius was an important 
theological centre From Krakw to Venice Jews maintained networks that 
were involved in the Hebrew book trade stimulated by fierce debates over 
messianic movements such as Sabbateanism and by Christian Hebraists who 
sought to better understand the Bible via the Rabbinic traditions
