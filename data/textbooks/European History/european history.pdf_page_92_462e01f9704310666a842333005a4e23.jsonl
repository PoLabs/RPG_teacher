Taking slaves was part of their business but the point of that business was 
largely to extort high ransoms in exchange for their safe return At the same 
time many slaves were also released into freedom following their religious 
conversion and integration into the host society As a consequence for many 
European slaves as well as many Muslim slaves in Europe slavery was not 
permanent In fact wellknown figures such as the Spanish writer Miguel 
de Cervantes 15471616 the author of Don Quixote spent time as slaves in 
Algiers and elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire Ironically so did John Newton 
17251807 a British captain of a vessel engaged in the Atlantic slave trade

Coerced and Forced Migration Europes Global Footprint
If migration was not always voluntary the nature and extent of force applied to 
different groups differed widely Settlement programmes like those mentioned 
in the previous sections could offer incentives for those agreeing to move
alongside a wide variety of punishments for those who refused to complyas 
with the expulsions of Jews and Moriscos from the Iberian Peninsula Another 
type of coerced migration is the movement of those who exchanged their prison

an important role in the formation of empires For example the Portuguese 
Empire in West Africa and the Indian Ocean Estado da India depended on 
prisoners who served as soldiers in its outposts Gypsies Romani people 
would also be transferred to the overseas territories It is also worth mentioning 
the socalled rfs dElReiorphaned daughters and widows mostly of 
minor nobility who served the Portuguese Crownespecially in the case of

instilled in them they travelled to the overseas territories with a dowry that 
enabled them to marry there This migration while forced by circumstance 
opened up interesting opportunities for these women and their families as a 
result of their marital unions The socalled filles du roy sent by Louis XIV to 
New France Canada played a similar role in helping to increase the number 
of inhabitants of European descent in the French American territories
The migration of around one million indentured servants to the British 
colonies or to the Caribbean during the early modern period should also 
be considered here Indentured servants were men or women who took 
out socalled indentures loans to pay for the cost of their transportation 
overseas In return the labourers were obliged to work without salary for 
their employers for typically between four and seven years Although they
