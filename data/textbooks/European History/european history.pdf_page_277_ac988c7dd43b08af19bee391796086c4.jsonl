24 INEQUALITIES

Minorities were seen as potential traitors to the new national communities 
majoritarian public opinion saw them as obstacles to the nationbuilding process 
or as politically inclined to challenge the new territorial statusquo There 
were big differences in the social and cultural conditions of these minorities 
and in the way they were dealt with by legislation and by social norms but 
discrimination existed everywhere During and after the Second World War 
millions of people were subject to ethnic cleansing a solution already put in 
place by Turkey which expelled thousands of Greek Orthodox families from 
Anatolia and by Greece which exchanged them for its Muslim subjects in 
1923 a highly traumatic experience that contributed to a homogenisation of 
the postwar nationstates
Among the minorities that suffered systematic discrimination in the 
interwar period were the Jews The Nazi regime first segregated them then 
ghettoised their communities and finally launched their extermination in 
all areas it controlled The genocide of Jews which had a precedent in the 
massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War 
was often welcomed by sectors of the population that had been won over 
by antisemitism in countries across Europe and for this reason found the 
support and the collaboration of many local groups The death of around two 
thirds of European Jews was followed by a large emigration to the state of 
Israel established in 1948 Open discrimination of Jewish citizens tended to 
disappear in postwar Europe although antisemitism did not and it was even 
translated sometimes and in certain countries into measures that implied a 
discriminatory treatment of those considered to be Jews
The Roma and Sinti were also isolated by the Nazis and then subjected 
to measures aiming at their extermination in what is nowadays called the 
Porajmos For centuries the Roma and Sinti had been a subaltern ethnic group 
in Europe often subject to prosecutions and penal sanctions and their position 
in most European countries did not improve after the war to the point that 
their suffering under Nazism was not even made visible They continued to 
live at the margins of society Fordist capitalism and communism gradually 
closed many spaces in which the Roma had previously lived and operated 
whilst a varying combination of social policies and repression tried to force 
them to abandon their ways of life
A new dimension of inequality took off in Europe during the 1950s 
and 1960s The demand for labour in the fastestgrowing economies of 
northwestern Europe fostered a southnorth migration that took millions of 
Portuguese Spaniards Italians Yugoslavians Greeks and Turks to the more 
industrialised countries North African and Caribbean groups were also 
recruited to work in France and Britain while the arrival of people from other 
continents was initiated by decolonisation especially when the process ended
