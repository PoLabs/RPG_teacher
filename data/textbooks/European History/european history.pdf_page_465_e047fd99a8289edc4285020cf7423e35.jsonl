41 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
445
This emphasis on technology marked a shift from protecting stability 
towards nurturing perpetual technological change Sometimes associated with 
the expansion of liberal capitalism and industrial production Schumpeter 
this shift coproduced a rapid development of new technologies throughout 
the nineteenth century While the initial phase of the Industrial Revolution 
was built upon incremental innovations in textile and steel production and the 
associated transition to the mechanisation of production the socalled Second 
Industrial Revolution brought significant leaps in many fields of technological 
knowledge and production this time properly engineered and sciencebased 
To list just a few examples the rapid development of electrical engineering 
including the telegraph lighting electric generators and radio chemical 
industry such as fertiliserssee the work of the German scientist and engineer 
Justus von Liebig 18031873 and machinery such as the steam turbine for 
generating electricity developed by the British engineer Charles Parsons 
18541931 or the famous internal combustion engine designed by Rudolf 
Diesel on the basis of the principles of thermodynamics These advances 
significantly increased energy efficiency in the production of industrial and 
agricultural goods and transformed livelihoods across European societies
During the nineteenth century Europeans started to identify with technology 
which they began seeing as a defining characteristic of their civilisation and 
essential proof of its superiority In the words of Michael Adas technology 
became a Measure of Mennot only in encounters with nonEuropean 
cultures but also within Europe Following the Great Exhibition of Products 
of French Industry held in Paris in 1798 annual national industrial fairs and 
exhibitions became a common sight in European capitals in the first half of the 
nineteenth century providing an opportunity for regions to demonstrate and 
compete over their technological prowess The Great Exhibition of the Works 
of Industry of All Nations organised in London in 1851 for which the Crystal 
Palace was famously constructed shifted the competition to an international 
level 
International competition sometimes transformed into a broader rivalry 
or fit into a preexisting one Such was the case of the FrancoPrussian 
Great Train Race between 1815 and 1914 National politics of technology 
required centralisation and control over the adoption and development of 
new technologies State authorities made considerable efforts to standardise 
supervise and organise implementation of these new innovations Often 
especially in case of communication and transport infrastructures the military 
played an important part in technological expansion Some even speak in this 
sense of the formation of the infrastructural state characterised by an ideology 
of centralisation expanding statecontrolled networks and the administration 
of development by growing expert bureaucracies Both France and Prussia
