a Indias in Seville assumed the legal powers in the civil sphere of the Casa de 
la Contratacin to protect the interests of businessmen and merchant traders 
with business in America against the interference of other private individuals 
and foreigners Apart from administering the avera tax for the protection 
of merchant ships this commercial lobby was the driving force behind the 
organisation of two fleets or armadas that covered the route to the mainland 
and New Spain each year These convoys transported the silver extracted in 
the Peruvian and Mexican mines The muchdemanded that precious metal 
was sent back to the Old World and was additionally used for the exchange of 
Asian goods through the Manila Galleon 
The Casa de la Contratacin like the Portuguese Casa da ndia had a scientific 
function Among its maritime attributions it was in charge of training the 
pilots who would cover the interoceanic crossing the design and production 
of nautical chartssuch as keeping the Royal Register up to dateand other 
navigational instruments and the administration of the news received from 
the geographical advances of the different expeditions sponsored by the kings 
of Spain In 1717 the definitive transfer of its headquarters to Cadiz together 
with the Consulado de Cargadores had a strong impact on Seville which 
ceased to be the epicentre of the Carrera de Indias This change of location had 
been planned for decades but it was not until that year that it was officially 
formalised However Charles IIIs reforms and his measures in the last quarter 
of the eighteenth century to liberalise American trade weakened the mercantile 
strength that the Casa de la Contratacin had enjoyed since its creation
