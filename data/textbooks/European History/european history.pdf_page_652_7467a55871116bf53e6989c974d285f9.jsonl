Another factor was the emergence of craft manuals In the fourteenth 
century books full of socalled craft secrets appearedsocalled because 
publication by definition ended the secrecy They were perhaps never meant 
to be secret but there was some mystery to the crafts which could only be 
mastered through plenty of direct handson training Still these manuscripts 
purported to give the reader access to the procedures of artisan production 
After the invention of print in the middle of the fifteenth century craft manuals 
multiplied and became very popular Contributing to this popularity were the 
increasing numbers of literate craftsmen and women One exemplary craft 
manual was a book about human proportions published by the wellknown 
German painter Albrecht Drer in 1528 A century later Rembrandt had a 
copy in his studio in Amsterdam apparently for the instruction of his pupils 
The number of titles devoted to science technology and medicine published 
in Britain increased from 55 to nine percent during the eighteenth century 
many of those titles had a practical aspect It was difficult if not impossible 
to learn a craft exclusively from a textbook However those who had acquired 
the necessary skills could improve them by reading such books
Moreover such books were increasingly illustrated allowing the reader to 
see what the often complicated instructions amounted to Drer had lavishly 
illustrated his book on human proportions with pictures on the lefthand 
pages and text on the righthand side In the fifteenth century various types 
of engraving emerged in Europe possibly imitated from the Chinese In the 
beginning woodcuts dominated which were often course and did not permit 
much detail But from the sixteenth century this was another area where 
craftsmen became more sophisticated producing for example exploded 
views showing the inside of complex machinery Together illustrations 
texts and practical instruction helped craftsmen and women all over Europe 
to improve their working practices andthrough improving their working 
practicesthe products they supplied to consumers
Commercialisation Colonisation and Urbanisation 
Beginning in Italy and moving across the Alps to Germany France and the Low 
Countries these transformations in guild and craft production were integral 
to the emergence of consumer societies in premodern Europe whereby men 
and women below the level of the aristocratic elites could choose to purchase 
a range of goods based on criteria other than simple utility or need However 
developments in craft production were not the only reason behind the greater 
availability and choice of commodities Neither do they explain the greater 
capacity and willingness of different social groups to enter the market to buy
