played out differently in early modern modern and contemporary history in 
different European contexts The chapters are broadly comparative offering 
national case studies to highlight the variety of the European experience The 
aim was not to offer another master narrative of European history The aim 
was not to provide a comprehensive exhaustive account of European events 
from all possible viewpoints replacing a single national perspective with a 
collection of national perspectives How many national perspectives would 
one need to create the European perspective anyway Five Ten Twenty
seven Completeness even if it were attainable is not the answer Paul Dukes 
himself a renowned expert in European history argued that European history 
must be more than the sum total of its constituent parts For us European 
history is not a body of knowledge but a method an approach 
This means that readers will always find important omissions Due to the 
nature of our team and the focus of this project certain perspectives eg 
Scandinavian southeastern European Polish or nonEuropean and colonial 
experiences are sometimes underrepresented We have tried to address these 
gaps by providing relevant secondary literature in the bibliography of each 
subchapter We hope however that this handbook succeeds in demonstrating 
the heterogeneity and complexity of the many different development paths 
within geographic Europe with attention to how these paths were linked to 
and dependent on nonEuropean developments 
The chapters in this handbook are not intended to answer all of the questions 
that students might have about European history on the contrary they are 
meant as discussion starters designed to complicate seemingly conclusive 
historical narratives and to generate class discussion They should make 
students think and ask themselves which perspectives are missing from this 
collection of multiperspective histories and which other approaches could 
be taken The one overarching lesson that all chapters intend to teach is that 
European history is always incomplete This lesson is best expressed by this 
books cover image a classical sculpture located in Carrara Italy missing its 
head The statues incompleteness not only reflects the doublesided nature 
of European historycivilisation and violencebut also it ambiguous 
unfinished and broken character European history does not have a single 
vision or master narrative but instead results from a complex interplay of 
forces that are best understood by drawing on multiple perspectives
This handbook is one of the outputs of the Erasmus Strategic Partnership 
Teaching European History in the 21st Century TEH21 financed by the 
European Commission and running from 20192022 We are grateful for 
the support of the Dutch National Agencies Erasmus during this time 
particularly during the difficult first months when we had to adapt the project 
to the challenges of the Covid19 pandemic Our project partner the European
