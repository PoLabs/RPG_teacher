The stateoriented character of education and culture was also reflected in 
the increasing dependence of academy and university staff on financing from 
their government While professors in the early modern period were usually 
financed by money paid by their students to attend lectures between the 
eighteenth and early twentieth centuries the state took over this task for the 
most part In many European countries professors and lecturers became civil 
servants and many universities were transformed into state universities The 
stateorientation of science and education can also be seen in the founding 
of national associations of school and university representatives which acted 
as interest groups At the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the 
first national conferences of rectors were established in Western European 
countries These included the Netherlands with its Rectors College founded 
in 1898 and Switzerland with its University Rectors Conference founded in 
1904
In the sciences and humanities a differentiation of disciplines began to 
emerge While the medieval universities typically had only four faculties
theology medicine law and philosophya broad system of subjects 
developed in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth century which led 
to the establishment of new faculties and institutes One example among 
many was the establishment of new disciplinary university degrees such as 
the history degree which replaced the more generic philosophy degree in 
Belgium in 1890 An increasing demand for more practical subjects such as 
engineering and chemistry resulted in the establishment of new natural and 
technical science faculties In a similar move the more policyoriented social 
sciences faculties complemented the older humanities Separate natural science 
and technology colleges emerged alongside specific schools for subjects such 
as mining and agriculture which over time were integrated into existing 
universities or upgraded to full universities
The differentiation and professionalisation of research fields was accompanied 
by a restructuring process within the universities New positions were created 
and the number of teaching staff expanded Besides professors and students 
positions were established for lecturers research assistants administrators 
and coordinators The ideal of the university as a community of equal scholars 
was often replaced by the hierarchical university in which full professors 
known in the Germanspeaking world as Ordinarius and in the English
speaking world as Don held a dominant position
As a result of professionalisation the ideal image of a humanist scholar 
wearing his gown was replaced by the model of an expert professor in a 
white lab coat Rather than individualistic artistlike figures academics 
became experts and members of a scientific community doing collective work 
Objective measures for scientific achievement were established and specialised
