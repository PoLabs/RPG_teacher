Conclusion
In short the long nineteenth century which had started with the trauma of 
total war secured peace on the continent and between empires for some 
decades It was underpinned by new methods and means for cooperation 
consultation and deliberation accompanied by the emergence of early peace 
movements and a thriving scene of pacifist thought Yet this cooperation led 
to largescale expansive projects in overseas territories The development 
of industrial warfare of mechanised sea power and the division of global 
spheres of influences gave a new boost to imperial expansion and after 1885 
increasing competition leading up to the First World War
