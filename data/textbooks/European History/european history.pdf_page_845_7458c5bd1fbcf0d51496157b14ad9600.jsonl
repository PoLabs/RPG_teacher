Utopian Communities in Early Modern Europe
If the text of Utopia was one legacy of Thomas More then the label of 
utopianism was another Commentators often used it to belittle political 
positions During the English Revolution for example the regicide John Cook 
felt the need to make clear that I am not of their opinion that drive a parity to 
have all men alike it is but a Utopian fiction the Scripture holds forth no such 
thing He likewise stressed that the idea a man should have money because 
he dreams of it was just a Utopian imaginary Consideration 
Cooks dismissal of these alternative positions was in fact testimony to their 
proliferation over the preceding century across Europe with the Reformation 
and CounterReformation leading to multiple radical religious groups and 
sects These groups offered opportunities to experiment with new ideals and

would take his irony literally and use his text as a justification for radical ideas 
hence his preference to keep Utopia away from the masses come to pass 
his own terminology was now appropriated to describe these experiments in 
worshipping living and loving
The shoemaker George Fox for example as the founder of the biggest 
dissenter church in England in the midseventeenth century the Quakers or 
the Society of Friends asserted womens rights to preach and predict Quakers 
held informal religious services in domestic meeting houses where men and 
women sat in silent contemplation until they felt an inner prompt the light 
to speak up and share their inspiration with others In these visions both men 
and women used metaphors in which conventional gender boundaries were 
transgressed In addition to using fluid genderless language many female 
visionaries described themselves as weak and empty vessels as passive

that exactly their feminine attributes could lead to closeness to God as an 
instrument of divine authority Quaker men in turn identified with infantile
