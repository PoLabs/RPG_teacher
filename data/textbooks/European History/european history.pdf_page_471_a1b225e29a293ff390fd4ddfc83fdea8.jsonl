significant acceleration of technological change would undoubtedly rank high 
among those extremes Processes of development and the implementation 
of new technological innovations became more deeply institutionalised and 
systematic than ever before with states playing an increasingly active role 
Furthermore the production of innovations was built upon a growing state 
involvement with scientific research which correspondingly became more 
and more organised Advances in energy production and longdistance power 
transmission enabled the electrification of factories and households both in the 
cities and in rural areas which sped up in the decades immediately following 
the Second World War The rapid development and expansion of infrastructural 
systems such as central heating water supply transportation and the electrical 
grid significantly transformed peoples lives and living environmentsurban 
areas were gradually getting rid of the ubiquitous coal dust hygiene and 
housing standards improved and livestock disappeared first from urban 
yards and later from most of the country dwellings New synthetic materials 
such as nylon or Bakelite made fashion and various technological gadgets 
more accessible to everyone Various electric home appliances introduced on 
the European markets transformed the organisation of family life Science 
and technology now joined into an inseparable whole reconfigured their 
European users who for their part started to consciously influence and shape
