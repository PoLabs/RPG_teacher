world see Chapter 141 In the process the term racewhich had previously 
and rather vaguely signified descent from a noble family or could be used 
more generally as a synonym for people especially in Englishacquired 
its modern meaning of membership in a biologically defined ethnic group 
which nevertheless remained culturally and socially constructed In spite 
of the scientific ideals of objective classification proponents of race theory 
like Immanuel Kant 17241804 enshrined ideas of alterity which could 
be used to provide justification for colonial rule and slavery Such theories 
also encompassed minorities in Europe like the Scandinavian Sami whom 
GeorgesLouis Leclerc de Buffon 17071788 judged to have few virtues and 
all the vices of ignorance Although very influential such theories provide no 
insight into the practical organisation of interethnic relations in Europe
The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth as an Example of 
an Early Modern Multiethnic Polity
While there is much that is unique about the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth 
the cohabitation of multiple ethnic linguistic and religious groups observed 
here as well as the institutions and policies adopted in relation to ethnic 
diversity in many respects resemble those found in other early modern 
empires like Russia Habsburgruled Southeast Europe and the Ottoman 
Empire After the Union of Poland and Lithuania in 1569 the Commonwealth 
was one of the six largest European polities Although formally an elective 
monarchy contemporaries already referred to PolandLithuania as the 
Republic of Poland Rzeczpospolita because of the great political influence 
of the wealthiest part of the nobility the Magnates The Union brought 
together a staggering variety of beliefs and languages Roman and Greek 
Catholics formed the dominant religious groups but there were also large 
numbers of Jews Greek Catholics and Protestants in the country Polish and 
Ruthenian a relative of todays Ukrainian and Belarusian languages were 
the most important Slavonic languages spoken in the Commonwealth besides 
Lithuanian In addition the population included a considerable number of 
German and Yiddish speakers
At the beginning of the early modern period the population of Poland was 
estimated to consist of around seventy percent Poles fifteen percent Ruthenians 
and at least ten percent Germans with the rest comprised of Armenians Jews 
Karaites Romani Tatars Vlachs and others After the Union with Lithuania 
Poles still formed about fifty percent of the overall population whereas forty 
percent were Lithuanians and Ruthenians with the remaining ten percent 
made up of Germans Jews nonLithuanian Balts and other ethnicities
