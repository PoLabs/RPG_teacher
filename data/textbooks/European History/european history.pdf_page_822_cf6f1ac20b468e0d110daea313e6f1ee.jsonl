and working in industrial or service jobs forced families to change the ways 
they lived and worked together as well as how individual family members 
related to each other
Strictly regimented industrial and clerical work in specialised factory or 
office spaces dissolved the old mode of family cohabitation in which the 
familys house was an economic as well as private space It transformed the 
familial living space into a purely or mostly private sphere creating a spatial 
distinction unknown or uncommon in premodern Europe Urban families 
adapted to that separation in different ways Among the urban middle classes 
this differentiation of space reenforced the model of a nuclear family with a 
male breadwinner a housewife and their children It furthermore strengthened 
the patriarchal power of the father since family life was mostly built around 
the needs of the breadwinner In these urban middleclass families the private 
home became a sphere of retreat and recreation away from work Although 
urban workingclass families also experienced the separation of the economic 
and the domestic spheres their experience was of a very different sort To 
finance their livelihoods and pay their rent workingclass families usually 
lived as extended families in rather crowded apartments Often they had to 
take in lodgers nonfamily members living in the same apartment for a certain 
sum of money In these workingclass families the women and sometimes 
even children were often part of the workforce too making family life much 
less centred around a single person Due to the harsher conditions and longer 
working hours of workingclass jobs workingclass living spaces were not 
regularly used for recreation from work This situation was barely comparable 
with the middleclass lifestyle of the nuclear family Yet skilled workers on the 
brink of moving up into the middle classes often strove to imitate the nuclear 
family model with a sole male breadwinner
Urbanisation also changed the space in which families lived together The 
quick influx of mostly lowincome newly urban families firstly caused a rise in 
mortality During early industrialisation mortality rates in urban areas were 
often significantly higher than in rural areas mostly due to overcrowding 
harsh working conditions and especially to a lack of public sanitation and 
clean water which led to infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid 
fever This made it quickly apparent to urban authorities and social reformers 
that newly industrial cities had to be carefully planned Aside from sanitation 
and public health that also included the ways families were housed Whereas 
the aforementioned rural forms of familial conviviality could vary greatly 
across Europe most industrial towns chose a model in which a family lived 
together in one flat which they rented situated within an apartment building 
consisting of several flats However there still were great differences from 
todays onefamily apartments While today one family within an apartment 
consists of two generations in the nineteenth century it was more often three
