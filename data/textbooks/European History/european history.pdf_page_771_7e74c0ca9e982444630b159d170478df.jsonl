By contrast Nazi ideology went beyond the pure nationalist belief in the 
right of a particular people Germans to possess its own nationstate Instead 
National Socialism created an uneasy cocktail of various political pseudo
scientific and premodern ideologies practices and outlooks At its core the 
Nazi worldview was based on two elements an extreme and violent form 
of racial antisemitism hatred of the Jewish people and the desire to obtain 
Lebensraum living space preferably in Eastern Europe for the expansion of the 
Aryan German race These two ingredientsantisemitism and Lebensraum
were intimately connected the Nazis believed that Jews in both Germany and 
the rest of the world were part of a large conspiracy that prevented the Aryan 
master race from reaching its full potential Jews were accused of conspiring

open to peaceful cooperation with bourgeois organisations while socialist 
revolutionaries laboured in rural areas on behalf of the large Russian peasant 
community With the 1917 October Revolution Lenin and the Bolsheviks had 
seized power and by the spring of 1918 they continued to set the tone for the 
violently oppressive course that the Soviet Union was to fare in the decades 
to come reaching its zenith during Joseph Stalins reign from 1924 to 1953 
MarxismLeninism was transformed from an internationalist and idealistic 
project into a Stalinist statefocused regime with nationalistic overtones 
Admittedly some elements of the strong egalitarianism that had underpinned 
Marxs original ideas were maintained in Stalinism The Soviet state invested

and peoplefocused technology Nevertheless on the most fundamental level
