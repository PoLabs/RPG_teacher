Violence Profit and Exploitation
One of the worst elements of European colonialism in this period was the 
transatlantic slave trade which involved kidnapping men women and 
children from West Africa and transporting them to the new world over 
the infamous Middle Passage Many died in dire conditions during their 
transport Those that arrived were sold in the Caribbean and elsewhere in the 
Americas and forced to work on plantations in hideous conditions often until 
death The enormous scale and cruelty of the transatlantic slave trade was the 
subject of contemporary critique not least by abolitionists many of them of 
African origin who became increasingly vocal in the nineteenth century and 
who engaged with slaveowning interests in a war of representation over race 
which had longlasting legacies There were some moves towards an abolition 
of slavery Revolution in the French colony of SaintDomingue which brought 
into existence the Republic of Haiti at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries was a decisive step that exposed the cruelty of slavery Subsequently 
slavery was officially abolished in the British Empire in the 1830s in the French 
Empire in the 1840s and in other empires like the Dutch later in the century 
But enslavement continued to be an important feature accompanying colonial 
expansion It expanded in some colonies namely Cuba possessed by Spain 
until the very end of the nineteenth century and also continued to be legal in 
some postcolonial states southern USA Brazil The transatlantic slave trade 
also continued In fact in terms of the number of slaves transported across the 
Atlantic even though we cannot estimate this precisely since a great portion 
of this trade was illegal the slave trade was actually at its highest in the early 
decades of the nineteenth century The cruelty of the plantation slavery system 
also reached its highest point in the nineteenth centuryparadoxically due to 
the introduction of technical innovations such as steam power for the sugar 
mills that increased the capacity of the plantations in the Caribbean but which 
also raised the pressure on the enslaved workforce Further enslavement in the 
Caribbean and elsewhere continued to have formative legacies throughout the 
nineteenth century 
Economic exploitation also fed into the creation of European empires in 
other ways The Congo Free State ruled infamously from 1885 to 1908 as the 
private possession of the Belgian King Leopold II is often seen as one of the 
worst phases in the history of European colonialism This was according 
to some imperialism at its cruelest Among the most gruesome practices 
carried out in an effort to enforce rubber quotas was a policy of physical
