early modern period during the Enlightenment and the French Revolution 
or in some areas even later 
Like the Jews the Roma who had come to Western Europe at the beginning of 
the fifteenth century soon faced considerable mistrust As pilgrims equipped 
with papal imperial and local safeconducts groups of Roma were initially 
welcomed in most parts of Europe Yet by the turn of the sixteenth century 
elites began questioning the narrative of the penitential pilgrims The Roma 
were described as strange in terms of skin colour language and their 
high mobility although the latter was often the result of necessity rather 
than choice Contradictory ethnic labels such as Egyptians Gypsies and 
Tatarsthe Romani word Roma does not appear in early modern sourcesas 
well as frequent but incorrect abuse of the Roma as heathens all point to the 
difficulties contemporaries found in placing the new minority into any clear 
category Over the course of the early modern period some commentators 
came to doubt that they were a people in their own right claiming among 
other things that Romani identity had simply been assumed by vagabonds 
thieves and robbers
By the sixteenth century Roma communities increasingly fell victim to 
marginalisation and discrimination Stigmatising accusations of laziness 
dishonesty theft robbery fraud espionage magical practices and bargaining 
with the devil made their situation much more difficult In addition numerous 
European territories tried to expel the Roma under the regulations of poor 
laws which were aimed especially at itinerant groups Despite these hardships 
Roma worked as blacksmiths basket makers horse traders construction and 
farm workers traders healers entertainers miners soldiers and even in law 
enforcement They were often highly specialised workers and thus played a 
complex role in most early modern European societies meaning that their 
history cannot be reduced to persecution
The status and fate of the Roma as a groupor more precisely as a wide 
range of communitiesalso varied over time and space While those living 
in Hungary were at times more firmly integrated into feudal structures and 
faced less marginalisation Roma communities were enslaved for several 
centuries in the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia After a period of 
extensive persecution during the eighteenth century a few countries launched 
new disciplinary policies to aggressively integrate and assimilate the Roma 
In addition to older Spanish settlement initiatives the enlightened rulers of 
the Habsburg Empire Maria Theresa 17171780 and Joseph II 17411790 
enforced a rigid settlement policy particularly in Burgenland in presentday 
eastern Austria which also aimed at undermining Romani collective identity
