Natural Resources and the Transformation of the 
Environment
The early modern era witnessed an expansion and intensification of the 
extraction of natural resources across the continent for direct consumption 
fish game food crops construction wood stone clay fuel wood peat 
coal fertilisation bird excrements ashes and various industrial uses ores 
minerals industrial crops This process was associated with demographic 
growth and the emergence of merchant capitalism in northwestern Europe 
Demographic recovery after the recurrent plague epidemics of the fourteenth 
and fifteenth centuries was generally very slow but there were important 
regional differences The urban areas of northwestern Europe such as the Low 
Countries and the London region experienced a steep rise in population These 
regions soon faced the problem of feeding their populations using regional 
agriculture and required food imports while simultaneously developing an 
economy based on manufacturing and trade Reaching the limits of traditional 
local supplies methods of production and established trade networks Dutch 
and English merchants moved their attention initially to adjacent areas but 
from the midsixteenth century predominantly to more distant sources in the 
Baltic region and overseas 
Practices of mass production of crops and the exploitation of nature for 
exports emerged in peripheral parts of Europe significantly altering local 
environments A good example is the exploitation of woodlands Wood 
represented a critical resource in the development of early modern European 
societies and the economist Werner Sombart 18631941 even coined the 
notion of the Wooden Age to emphasise this While England gradually 
turned to coal and the Netherlands relied on peat from the late Middle Ages 
onward wood remained indispensable as a fuel in most of Europe It was also 
irreplaceable as a raw material for various industries in the form of charcoal 
for smelting and iron forging and potash a byproduct of burning utilised 
for textile manufacturing and glass melting Furthermore a steady supply of 
timber was required for the construction of housing in growing urban centres 
to fuel mining rushes and in shipbuilding as a necessary precondition for 
maritime trade and warit has been estimated that the construction of one 
seventeenthcentury warship consumed twentyfour hectares of mature forest 
Some areas in Europe witnessed a considerable reduction of woodland 
areas France lost fifty percent of its forests between 1550 and 1789 Denmark 
almost two thirds between 1600 and 1750 and Ireland and Spain lost their 
forests almost entirely Deforestation and parallel population growth drove 
wood prices up the firewood necessary for cooking was sometimes more 
expensive than the meal itself In response to the great demand for wood 
central and northern Europe witnessed the development of systematic forest
