23 HOUSEHOLD AND FAMILY

Even in the Soviet Union which had initially sought equality for women and 
innovation in the sphere of the family later constitutional changes meant that 
women were encouraged to prioritise their roles as wives and mothers 
Some of the movements to preserve the family during this period did not 
however aim to preserve the old order but rather to forge a new supposedly 
purer order For example National Socialist Germany banned intermarriage 
between Jews and nonJews in 1935 Germany was not unique in adopting 
racial and eugenic family policies Sweden too for example introduced laws 
that banned undesirable individuals such as the disabled from marrying 
and having children while Switzerland separated parents and children within 
the partly nomadic Yenish population between 1926 and 1973 in an attempt to 
force this minority group to assimilate 
Progressive campaigns related to marriage and family law nonetheless 
continued in parallel with movements that sought to preserve what was seen 
as the traditional family This could be seen for example in the international 
arena where a womans right to retain her own citizenship upon marriage 
was fought out in the interwar period Eventually countries like Britain 
France and Germany changed the law so that women could maintain this 
essential aspect of autonomy in cases of intermarriage International bodies 
and conventions in the interwar and post1945 period such as the Convention 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 1979 continued to call 
for greater rights for women to choose whether and whom to marry and also 
for rights within marriage such as the right to retain a professional life and 
to be educated They also outlined universal rights for children regardless of 
their family of origin as in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child
In fact the period after 1945 continued to be characterised by the tension 
between conservatism around the family and calls for loosening restrictions
on women as well as on different sexual practices This could be seen for 
example in the movement for nofault divorce that took off across Europe 
from the late 1960s as well as ongoing changes to womens rights to property 
and inheritance as was the case in France into the 1980s and womens equal 
rights within marriage introduced in West Germany for example as late as 
1977 It could also be seen in the outlawing of marital rape across much of 
Europe in the last quarter of the twentieth century as was the case in Italy in 
1976 and in England and Wales only in 1991 
Some of the most significant shifts in family law came in the 1990s and 2000s 
with legislation creating civil partnerships and samesex marriage Europe has 
since continued to witness significant legal changes including the expansion 
of adoption and pension rights for civil partners and samesex couples new 
rights for cohabitees and recognition of transgender individuals Indeed the 
many shifts in marriage and family law described above were part of a broader
