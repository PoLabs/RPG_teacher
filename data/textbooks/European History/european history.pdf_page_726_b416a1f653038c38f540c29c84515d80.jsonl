did churches adapt to modern states and how did they maintain religious 
control over secularised populations The second question is situated at a more 
personal level what did it mean to be religious in modern times How are

Churches and Revolutions
The French Revolution annihilated the tradition of monarchic rule by divine 
right and paved the way for the creation of society and state on the basis of 
human rights A second revolutionary powerthe Industrial Revolution
transformed the economy and society of much of Europe during the nineteenth 
century Industry attracted the bourgeoisie and working people to the 
growing urban centres The result combined with the influence of the French 
Revolution gave rise not only to the first period of prosperity in modern urban 
culture but also to many new social problems and injustices on the dark side 
of metropolitan life During the nineteenth century the churches had to adapt 
themselves to the many developments occurring around them
The absolutist government of France under the last Bourbons was extremely 
unjust Thinkers of the Enlightenment helped precipitate revolutionary changes 
by suggesting new visions of human rights civil society and the modern 
constitutional monarchy On 14 July 1789 French civilian revolutionaries 
attacked the Bastille in Paris capturing the fortress that symbolised the ancien 
rgime and freeing its prisoners soon after it was demolished In August the 
old feudal absolutism was brought to an end when a Declaration of the Rights of 
Man was published by the National Constituent Assembly The church lands 
were taken into public ownership in an attempt to finance the revolutionary 
changes taking place The Church was dealt with in the Civil Constitution of the 
Clergy enacted in 1790 Many went along with this others refused and the 
Church split over the issue In practice the power of the papacy was abolished 
in France
The Jacobin regime 17931794 persecuted the resistant Catholic priests 
but instead of an atheist regime the Cult of the Supreme Being was established 
When General Napoleon Bonaparte 17691821 came to power he decided to 
restore normal relations with Pope Pius VII 17401823 According to a new 
concordat in 1801 the French clergy were to receive a regular income from 
the state Although the Pope was to appoint bishops the state could veto his 
appointments Protestants were granted freedom of religion Religion was thus 
at the heart of the revolutionary turmoil that France experienced in the years 
that followed 1789 with repercussions throughout the nineteenth century
