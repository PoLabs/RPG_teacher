52 DISTRIBUTING WEALTH

these ideas were entrenched within more general conceptions of the political 
and social order Therefore notions about the distribution of wealth were 
usually linked to ideas about what is considered a just relationship between 
the prince the most affluent and the least so
According to the Flemish humanist Justus Lipsius 15471606 a king 
should be generous but with proper judgement and moderation To illustrate 
the same contrary values of liberality or generositywhich was regarded 
as a virtueand prodigality profuse or wasteful expenditure the Spanish 
diplomat Diego de Saavedra Fajardo 15841648 proposed a contrast between 
the mountain snow that melts slowly and permeates the fields through 
small streams on the one hand and big rivers that flow without control and 
pass without truly benefiting the valleys and fields they cross on the other 
Continuing with the same metaphor Saavedra advised the prince not to give 
water to the big lakes that do not need it and not to leave dry and thirsty the 
sands that represent the people The prince is further advised by Saavedra not 
to give the powerful what is owed to the poor and Saavedra also warns of the 
dangers of perceived vain expenditures and an excess of pomp Finally the 
ruler is reminded of the importance of a just distribution of the recompenses 
he offers All these perspectives show that the early modern age coded the idea 
of redistribution as a chain that emanates from the will of the powerful and 
extends to the poor 
This chain of redistributing the excess of wealth in the form of generosity 
also applied to noblemen and other privileged sectors of the society A general 
Christian principle for distributionhelp the poorguided these redistributive 
efforts Dominican friar and theologian Toms de Mercado ca 15231575 
reminded fellow clergy of the overarching presupposition about the excess of 
riches stating that their status obliged them more to distribute the surplus of 
their incomes than does to seculars Aristocrats were also impelled to share 
these beliefs and their testaments and last wills often included donations to 
the poor In fact poor people and poverty posed a major test for notions of 
distribution and care in the early modern age Throughout the period from 
1500 to 1800 prevailing moral views on the poor oscillated between suspicion 
and compassion Poverty continuously grew and a negative image of the poor 
slowly gained ground Much effort was aimed at differentiating the authentic 
poor from fake dishonest requests Poverty was increasingly criminalised and 
stigmatised but fundamental principles around care and poor relief did not 
disappear completely 
Three primary areas of wealth distribution within the essentially unequal 
social system of the early modern age were the control of prices for basic 
products and supplies control of financial tools such as interest rates and tax 
distribution The three operated under the general moral principles already
