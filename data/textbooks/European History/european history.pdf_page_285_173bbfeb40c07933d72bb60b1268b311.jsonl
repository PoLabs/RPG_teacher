Introduction
This chapter discusses states and nations and we must be alert from the start 
that in historical texts these terms still very much carry the imprint of their 
origins in the nineteenth century Similar terms were used during the early 
modern period but they carried different meanings sometimes in subtle 
ways sometimes radically differently Borders between countries were blurred 
where today we find clear demarcations We still have European countries 
cobbled together from distinct unitsthink of the United Kingdombut these 
are coherent states compared to many of their early modern predecessors 
Few early modern states had proper governments as we know them today 
Patriotism may have been in evidence though nationalism was not And all of 
thisborders institutions and identitieswas contested
The political history of the European states as we know them today is 
almost by definition told by the victors that is those states that emerged out 
of this cauldron of early modern political history It is therefore important to 
ask whose history we are telling and how we know what we think we know 
A wide range of sources is available for many parts of central and western 
Europe including official certificates records and charters Such sources are 
much rarer in the east the history of early modern Russia for example is 
more based on the study of chronicles Chronicles were diverse and could be 
centralised or local secular or ecclesiastical but above all they were stories 
told from the perspective of those who had commissioned them Thus the 
rise of the principality of Moscow under Ivan III ruled 14621505 is usually 
described as the gathering of Russian lands in the literature it is studied in 
terms of centralisation and unification and not told from the perspective of 
the princely and republican states and confederations that it absorbed
