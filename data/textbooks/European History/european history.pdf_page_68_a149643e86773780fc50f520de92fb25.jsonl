of the nation The leaders of nationalist movements in Europe wanted to 
strengthen the abstract idea of a national community with the feeling of 
belonging to a territorial homeland delimited by clear borders For the elites 
of already established states such as France or Spain of recently united states 
like Germany or Italy and of nations without states like the Czechs Finns 
or Slovenes national identity became more important over the course of the 
nineteenth century overshadowing previous regional or religious identities 
Defining the national space became a pivotal part of constructing national 
identity A process of spatial socialisation occurred by which citizens were 
encouraged to see themselves as part of a collective identity defined by national 
territory In other words the lines on the map delimiting their living space 
became one of the symbols of their collective national identity Nationally 
minded elites looked upon these bordersfrequently shown in maps school 
textbooks and atlasesas the most important physical markers of national 
identity as well as social economic and psychological symbols
The hexagonal shape of France displayed in atlases and geography textbooks 
for example would become familiar to every French pupil during their school 
attendanceor at least that was the intention of the French authorities Finnish 
borders were personified by the picture of the Maiden of Finland so much that 
the northwestern part of the country was nicknamed the arm as it was 
easily recognisable as the right arm of the maiden Similarly symbolic images 
were depicted on various maps across Europe with the aim of making the 
nation spatially visible through its boundaries
These clearcut borderlines also helped citizens to define who their 
compatriots were those living within the borders and who they were not those 
living outside them This dichotomy which helped to divide communities 
into opposing categories an us versus a them was very much based on the 
existence of clear borders between states regions and other administrative 
units Drawing a boundary between their own nation and those who lived 
outside the national territory helped state leaders to create a sense of common 
identity and cohesion among the inhabitants of the territory thus defined 
Borders were almost always used by states and nations to symbolise territorial 
and national unity irrespective of whether they were shaped according to 
natural barriers like rivers eg Rhine Danube mountains Alps Pyrenees 
Carpathians and lakes Bodensee Ladoga or whether they were constructed 
on the basis of older historical traditions and fault lines such as the Czech 
lands or Finland
However such national territories were very rarely inhabited by uniformly 
integrated nations Many ethnic national and religious minorities across 
Europe were scattered across several countriesincluding for example the 
German minorities of Central Europe Such ethnic enclaves were very often
