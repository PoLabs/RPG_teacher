35 PROTEST AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS
407
Indeed the impact of the French Revolution of 1848 inspired uprisings 
elsewhere in Europe many of which were based on expanding the franchise 
As the century unfolded political elites throughout Europe made their peace 
with increased suffrage as the price of stability and enhanced legitimacy 
even Bismarck was reconciled to the need for universal suffrage to elect the 
newly established Reichstag in 1867 believing in the inherent conservatism 
of public opinion Protests in Britain reached their zenith in 1866 when a 
reform meeting in London led to a riot the following year responding to this 
pressure from without the government awarded suffrage to a section of the 
working class As more of the population gained inclusion into the political 
nation protests notably scaled downthat is at least until campaigns for 
female suffrage violent and peaceful gained traction throughout Europe in 
the opening decade of the twentieth century 
Womens Movements 
In nineteenthcentury Europe the situation of women differed significantly 
from that of men Although the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen 
1789 declared the equality of all men and stated that every citizen should be 
entitled to the same rights women were considered as merely passive citizens 
and denied civil and political rights 
Inequalities affecting girls and women were systemic and institutionalised 
Girls in most European countries for the most part of the nineteenth century 
could not attend the same types of schools except for elementary schools as 
boys and with some exceptions they could not study at universities until the 
1890s Throughout the nineteenth century there were countless occupations 
which women could not pursue Once a woman married she was subjected 
to her husbands legal financial and personal authority The lack of voting 
rights affected all women irrespective of their social standing 
As early as the 1790s basic inequalities were addressed by outstanding 
women such as the French author Olympe de Gouges 17481793 and the 
English writer Mary Wollstonecraft 17591797 Later womens movements 
sought to remedy the most fundamental inequalities coded into the social 
order Associations played a crucial role in the articulation of emancipatory 
demands 
regarding 
womens 
education 
legal 
status 
employment 
opportunities and political participation Womens rights groups initially 
at least recruited primarily middle and upper middleclass membership 
Workingclass womens organisations were formed at a later stage by the 
1880s they were usually associated with workers parties Bourgeois and 
socialist feminist groups often pursued different agendas However by the late 
nineteenth century the struggle for the vote became a common denominator 
of all womens movements
