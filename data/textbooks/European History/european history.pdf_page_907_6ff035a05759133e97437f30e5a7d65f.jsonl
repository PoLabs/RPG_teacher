Introduction
In many respects across different eras the ways in which people spend 
their free time has not changed Although sports and leisure activities were 
far less organised commercial and international in the early modern period 
compared to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries people of all social strata 
did enjoy exercising together playing games meeting with friends and family 
or watching entertainment Whether rich or poor they could participate in 
various activities after their daily work during work and sometimes even as 
their work Although the forms of activity differed across time and space the 
concept of people relaxing and enjoying their time while practicing some kind 
of sport or leisure was known in all cultures across all continents Whether 
they were physical intellectual or spiritual there were many activities that 
people undertook to entertain themselves 
This chapter presents a range of these activities including the performing 
arts as well as games and sport with an eye to several particular aspects 
One such aspect is the role of social status in shaping access to and pursuit 
of leisure While social status constrained the sorts of activities in which one 
might be able to engage the choice was still varied Some types of sports and 
games were restricted just to upper classes Huntingfor instancewas a 
leisure activity for the nobility while other activities like theatre and music 
were more popular and accessible forms of entertainment Additionally the 
early modern period saw the emergence of new sports and the transformation 
of older ones several modern sports began to take their current form in the 
early modern period Other overarching aspects this chapter will examine 
include the transfer of leisure activities across cultures and the many roles of 
leisure beyond amusement
