However many historians of the early modern period dispute that narrative 
arguing that it does not take into account decisive earlier changes in consumer 
habits In a pioneering study published in 1978 Joan Thirsk showed that the 
standard of living of the English peasantry improved between the first half 
of the sixteenth century and the end of the seventeenth century at the end of 
the period ordinary people had more objects of more diverse kinds Thirsk 
therefore denied the idea that the development of consumption was only a 
result of the industrial revolution In his very influential The Birth of a Consumer 
Society 1982 Neil McKendrick has followed the same path pointing out how 
widespread such consumer goods as cotton cloth tea or china were in England 
in the 1760s He has also claimed moreover that some innovative merchants 
like Josiah Wedgwood already promoted their products through effective 
advertising practices Thus according to McKendrick the increase in demand 
came first and changes in the conditions of production followed 
Within this alternative interpretative framework historians of the early 
modern era have proposed different chronologies and geographies for the 
development of consumption in European societies For instance according 
to Lorna Weatherill a major shift occurred in England between 1675 and 1725 
when objects which used to be rare like china curtains or clocks became 
more and more common For Carole Shammas the very first signs of this 
evolution can be seen as early as 1550 and some new products such as tobacco 
for example were already widely available before 1650 Jan de Vries for his 
part argues that an industrious revolution occurred in the Low Countries 
and to a lesser extent in England and in some parts of France and Germany 
between 1650 and 1800 eager to enjoy the delights of consumption families 
devoted more and more time to wage labour he claims in order to earn enough 
money to purchase new commodities available on the market cloth pocket 
watches mirrors small decorative objects etc Renaissance historians even 
suggest going further back in time For Richard Goldthwaite in particular the 
artistic blossoming of the Renaissance can be understood as a consumption 
phenomenon a demand for art that emerged during the Quattrocento in the 
cities of Northern Italy where the distribution of wealth allowed a substantial 
part of the population to buy objects crafted by goldsmiths painters sculptors 
or ceramists
Despite the importance of these chronological and geographical variations 
at least two consensual conclusions have been reached First of all a basic 
observation by the end of the eighteenth century households of all social 
levels throughout Europe held more objects of more diverse kinds than 
they did around 1500 even if scarcity selfconsumption and reuse were 
still major features of the material world Objects that used to be luxuries 
were now within reach for a larger part of the population Second some
