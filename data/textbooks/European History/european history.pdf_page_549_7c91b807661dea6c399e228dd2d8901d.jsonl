Introduction
In early modern Europe there were not many natural landscapes in the 
sense of nature untouched by man Almost everywhere the environment 
had been modified by human land use technology or anthropogenic climate 
change While Europeans had been interacting with their environment 
since prehistory in the early modern era the pace and magnitude of human 
interventions increased Intensified exploitation of natural resources gave rise 
to transformations of the environment that affected the entire continent and 
in some respects the world beyond Europe as well Attempts were made to 
overcome the dangers posed by the environment for instance through the 
construction of dikes to prevent flooding Attitudes towards the environment 
also changed Europeans increasingly felt that man should and could control 
and manage the natural world These changes were related to a number of 
developments characteristic for the era Population growth and urbanisation 
industrialisation commercialisation and the growth of longdistance trade 
all contributed as did the formation of increasingly powerful states able 
to initiate action The scientific revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries also played an important role It allowed Europeans to acquire a 
better understanding of the world around them and provided them with new 
technological means to exploit and control it as is demonstrated by the use of 
new engineering techniques in the construction of canals
