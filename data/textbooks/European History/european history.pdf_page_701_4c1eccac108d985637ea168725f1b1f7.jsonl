54 LABOUR AND FORCED LABOUR
681
In Eastern Europe in countries under Soviet influence the average citizen 
also gained new experiences of work during the decades of socialism Through 
nationalisation and collectivisation the state became the main employer In 
the rhetoric of these regimes this put an end to exploitation and as a result 
the workers attitude to work also changed Work became a moral duty and 
the source of selfpride The planned economy achieved full employment 
However if someone did not want to work under the socialist system it was 
a criminal offence In socialism more women took up places in the workforce 
than ever before The lack of male labour due to the Second World War 
played a crucial role However state discourse emphasised employment as 
a prerequisite for female emancipation The female tractor driver became a 
symbol of the modern socialist woman Conversely the woman who ran her 
household and raised her children became a symbol of anachronism From the 
late 1940s large masses of women were undertaking paid work not only in the 
socialist industry but also in collectivised agriculture 
Following the great migrations which took place after 1945 within Europe 
it is worth noting the beginning of postcolonial migration The collapse of 
colonial regimes outside Europe triggered a massive flow of immigrants who 
started to change the community models in most Western European countries 
In most cases the newcomers were given the opportunity to find employment 
only in lowpaid sectors of the economy In other cases local entrepreneurs 
found new business channels established through those who were privileged 
to have good personal contacts in their countries of origin During the post
war reconstruction labour migration was also organised in different states 
according to the model of guest workers Gastarbeiter
