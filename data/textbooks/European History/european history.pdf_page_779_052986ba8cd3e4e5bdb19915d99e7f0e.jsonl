631 Centres and Peripheries in Early 
Modern Europe c 15001800
Stefan B Kirmse with MarieLaure Legay
Introduction
This chapter discusses centreperiphery relations in early modern Europe 
focusing on practical policy and its repercussions while taking the evolution 
of discourse into account where appropriate In so doing it takes a sensitive 
view of power asymmetries and violence in early modern statebuilding rather 
than reproducing the rhetoric of different centres it tries to complement and 
challenge these narratives with more peripheral perspectives In addition 
the chapter delves into the idiosyncrasies of the early modern period How 
did centreperiphery relations during this period differ from earlier times and 
later developments As this chapter alone cannot do justice to the variety of 
European experiences it will zoom in on two specific contextsFrance and 
Russiaand reveal instructive similarities and differences between these 
cases
The notions of centre and periphery are laden with challenges For most 
European contexts the coexistence of central and peripheral institutions 
characterised both state and religious authorities Many states had multiple 
centres while peripheries were fluid and transient insofar as they became 
integrated into the heartlands over time For some larger early modern powers 
such as the British Russian and Ottoman Empires the distinction between 
interior and exterior peripheries is helpful the former often differed from 
both central regions and distant frontiers in that they retained the cultural 
heterogeneity characteristic of peripheries while gradually merging with the 
core in popular imagination and administrative practice Scotland and Wales 
for example have been analysed as internal peripheries Furthermore 
new spatial thinking has led historians to see early modern states less as 
bounded territories and more as relatively open spaces in which historically 
developed communication routes and the natural environment rivers seas 
plains valleys etc facilitated and increased connectivity far beyond state and
