What is European history AJP Taylor once quipped that European history is 
whatever the historian wants it to be This is certainly an appropriate account 
in that Taylor refers to the constructive nature of historiography emphasising 
that it is the historian who creates his or her subject matter However 
Taylors definition is also problematic because his choice to use the singular 
historian implies that writing history is a solitary endeavour the imprinting 
of one mind onto the page Nothing could be further from the development 
process of the present handbook of European history It is a collaborative effort 
of nearly a hundred historians from seventeen European universities and 
research institutions each individual with their own ideas about European 
history shaped by their personal backgrounds national contexts and academic 
traditions The resulting muddle is our answer to the question about the nature 
of European history it is complicated polyvocal sometimes in harmony 
often not multilayered and complex The pedagogical term for this approach 
is multiperspectivity in which different perspectives are used to evaluate 
historical events and processes In the words of a group of Dutch researchers 
led by Bjorn Wansink in the context of history education the notion of multi
perspectivity refers to the idea that history is interpretational and subjective 
with multiple coexisting narratives about particular historical events The 
core of what European history means to us is expressed in this quote 
The subject of European history has recently been the topic of a vigorous 
debate among historians One group has argued that European history should 
be about what could be called doing European History empirical research 
that transcends the nationstate in various wayseg projects which are 
conceived in a transnational comparative translocal way and which at the 
same time are located in Europe in one way or another We broadly align 
ourselves with this selfreflexive approach We argue that the subject matter of 
a handbook on European history does not in itself constitute a contribution to 
European history Whether a work makes a contribution to European history
