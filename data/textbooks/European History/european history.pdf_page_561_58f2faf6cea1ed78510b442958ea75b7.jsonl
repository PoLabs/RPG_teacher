pea plant experiments conducted in Moravia in the 1850s which provided 
a scientific basis for traditional forms of crossbreeding and enabled the 
development of more efficient agriculture In practice however such efforts 
undermined the ideological divide between nature and society the natural 
environment became more and more intertwined within emerging human
made technological systems
The conceptual division between the natural world and human society 
provided monarchies throughout Europe with a rationale to intensify 
centralised efforts to regulate scarce natural resources especially timber 
In a context of evergrowing demand for trees forestry manualsstarting 
with Hans Carl von Carlowitzs 16451714 Sylvicultura oeconomica 1713
provided royal employees with a technocratic and quantifiable framework 
Carlowitz identified mans greed lack of knowledge and mismanagement as 
causes of deforestation and called for a continuous resilient and sustainable 
use of forest resources As a result forestry services first established to 
manage the domanial forests of ruling families in Central Europe developed
between the 1760s and the 1800sa science of forestry which would be 
adapted in other countries and applied to the royal or newlydefined public 
lands almost everywhere in Europe Wherever they had the means forestry 
officers attempted to create homogeneous masses of trees in order to facilitate 
their commercial exploitation and increase fiscal revenues These services and 
other state officers did not only undertake the transformation of domanial and 
public forests the use of village woodlands was very often subject to strict 
regulation from above
The results of these trends were manifold From an environmental point 
of view the application of scientific forestry brought about a simplification 
of species in forests with the aim of producing monocultural evenage and 
geometrically ordered landscapes The rational forests were very productive 
and their weaknesses such as their tendency to decay only became evident 
in the long run On the other hand public or publicly regulated monocrop 
and protected forests had often negative consequences for local peasants 
traditional use of forest resources was criminalised with peasants deprived 
of pastures wood and other raw materials at risk of fines or imprisonment 
The impact of forestry and wild lands regulations were larger because 
customary systems of tenancy and property experienced a parallel change 
Church lands were privatised in most Catholic countries between the French 
Revolution and 1848 whereas seigneurial rights were redefined as public and 
private rights in a long sequence of reforms that would culminate in Russia in 
1861 with the emancipation of the serfs peasants who had hitherto been tied 
to specific manorial estates and subject to diverse personal obligations and to 
the jurisdiction of their lords These reforms very often went handinhand
