governorates or the Kingdom of Poland the eastern half of Poland then under 
Russian rule serfdom had ceased to exist earlier and by midcentury there 
were legal opportunities in all of the abovementioned countries for serfs to 
buy the lands they cultivated However in practice very few people could 
take advantage of those opportunities to become independent farmers most 
peasants remained subordinate tied to the land owned by their landlords 
Migration did not and could not become a mass phenomenon as long as the 
necessary infrastructure remained severely underdeveloped or was missing 
altogether In the German states ie states that would after 1871 comprise 
Imperial Germany and in the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy eg Lower 
and Upper Austria Bohemia or Moravia the road network was relatively 
welldeveloped and wellmaintained but in EastCentral and Eastern Europe 
most roads and highways were not paved before 1850 The first railway lines 
appeared in the region in the late 1830s but it took decades even in the more 
advanced areas for the railway network to develop into a dense web and 
railway connections remained extremely scant in SouthEastern Europe until 
the last decades of the century 
While legal and infrastructural conditions enabled migration the major 
motives for mass migration within Europe were economic push and pull 
factors poverty want work and pay This implied that industrialisation 
urbanisation and migration were interconnected processes which mutually 
stimulated each other yet never in a straightforward way the availability 
of work was influenced by the shift from an agricultural to an industrial 
economy forcing many people to move from the countryside to the city But 
the development of industry was never strictly related to urbanisation and 
industrialisation was unevenly spread across Europe Emergent industrial 
centres in England and Northern Europe attracted many immigrants but 
largescale industries arrived only in the second half of the century in Central 
Eastern and most of Southern Europe Perhaps not by coincidence these latter 
areas were also sources of longdistance emigration to the Americas 
International and Global Migration
Throughout the entire nineteenth century and long into the twentieth century 
many more emigrants left Europe than immigrants from elsewhere who 
entered the continent In this period some 55 to 60 million people left Europe 
In relative terms Argentina became the country with the largest immigrant 
community around 1914 fiftyeight percent of its eight million inhabitants 
were first or secondgeneration immigrants often from Spain and Italy 
Other popular destinations were Brazil Australia and Canada Yet in absolute 
numbers about a third of all European emigrants left for the United States
