appropriately on pain of punishment Above all however the nineteenth 
century is marked by the new role of childhood as a social grouping
The Welfare State and Primary Education and Its Effect on 
the Lifecycle 
The link between education on the one hand and childhood and youth on 
the other is not a modern phenomenon Nonetheless since the eighteenth 
century this relationship has become far more structured diversified and 
institutionalised The intervention of public authorities has played a key role in 
this process In the early modern era municipalities and religious authorities 
Christian Jewish and Muslim had often catered for the basic instruction 
of young children boys and girls whose parents could not afford a private 
tutor and talented youths of modest means were spotted and sent to study at 
institutions of higher learning together with the sons of welloff families In 
the late eighteenth century ruling elites took an active approach in promoting 
education convinced as they were of the benefits that an educated population 
would have for the wealth and might of the realm This Enlightenment belief in 
the usefulness of education permeated both Catholic and Protestant countries 
although there were important differences in the priorities of rulers and in the 
ways this creed manifested in institutions For example Catholic Austria an 
absolutist monarchy implemented mandatory education under the Empress 
Maria Theresa in 1775 while Catholic Spain a constitutional monarchy with 
a decadeslong liberal parliamentary tradition did not do so until 1857 
Revolutionary and imperial France set the example of a systematic approach 
to all levels of education understanding the school not only as a sort of factory 
producing patriots but also as the cornerstone of a meritocratic selection of 
national elites Not all countries were willing to follow this model and a great 
diversity of public and private institutions has remained the norm rather than 
the exception But it is undeniable that a statesupervised threestage model 
of education gradually became the norm in Europe while the mandatory 
period in school has tended to expand to midteen age Public investment in 
education has become a substantial part of a countrys budget
The stress on education had a great impact on the lives of children and 
young people increasing the hours they spent in school and reducing 
their participation in labour which salaried or not became not only more 
complicated but also less desirable for school pupils Poorer families had to 
learn how to get by without contributions from their children sometimes on 
the promise of eventual social ascension as a result their childs studies The 
stress on education as key to the prosperityor indeed the survivalof a 
country or an ethnic group sometimes led to arguments in favour of womens 
emancipation as in the case of the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey
