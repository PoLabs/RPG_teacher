inhabitants so that they could keep track of their citizens These developments 
started at rather different times however and the quality of the data produced 
also varied The censuses civil registries and population registers see Table 
1 for a description that were introduced in the nineteenth century were a vast 
improvement on earlier administration by churches and cities Information 
was now more standardised subject to controls and better stored To this 
day these systems are still being used to monitor who lives in a country and 
have only grown more sophisticated so that states can register their taxpayers 
property owners students patients drivers welfare recipients and so on
European administrative systems were made with specific goals in mind 
Before the nineteenth century the registration of people was often a task 
performed by churches Over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries this task was taken up by the centralising state be it a nationstate or 
an empire that wished to register its citizens The first staterun administrative 
system in Europe started in 1792 when the civil registryrecords of birth 
marriages and deathswas implemented in France for military conscription

time the ability of states to register and measure their citizens lives grew 
resulting in more specialised registers Besides basic demographic information 
on the population militia registers occupational censuses housing surveys 
nationwide taxation tables and causeofdeath registrations became available 
on a nationwide scale 
Staterun registrations were by no means a European invention Long 
before nationstates started to form in Europe there were already established 
states with civil administrations in China Japan and Korea What made 
the registration systems in nineteenthcentury Europe different was that all 
inhabitants of a country were registered not just heads of households or the 
affluent One of the main drivers behind the registration of all citizens was the 
strive to improve societies and make them quantifiable This was not only a 
moral pursuit but also an effort to build strong nations by making the most 
of society in military and economic terms The trend fully blossomed in the 
second half of the nineteenth century when the rise of statistics coincided with 
the concerns of medical professionals and social scholars Hygienic movements 
tried to improve living conditions while economists and other social scholars 
were very concerned with the state of the population During this time the 
civil administration was increasingly used to address economic and public 
health issues rather than military purposes 
The new records were used and accepted by the population since civil 
registration gave them rights formalised family relations and regulated
