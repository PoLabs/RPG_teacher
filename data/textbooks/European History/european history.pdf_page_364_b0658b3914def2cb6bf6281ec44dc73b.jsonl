age of reforms the liberal reformers proposed several advancements for the 
country led by a young talented and strongwilled politician Louis Kossuth 
18021894 
In 1848 the progressive demands were summed up in the famous Twelve 
Points which provided a common platform for Hungarian liberals They 
included freedom of the press the abolition of censorship the appointment 
of government by parliament annual parliamentary sessions equality before 
the law the abolition of serfdom and of tax exemptions for nobles and the 
reunion with Transylvania separated from the Kingdom during the Ottoman 
era The Twelve Points served as the basis of the 1848 April Laws 
The revolutionary events in Paris Berlin and most importantly Vienna 
offered an advantageous international background for Hungarian progressive 
politicians Hungary experienced a successful and peaceful sequence of 
constitutional reforms The new constitution ratified by Emperor Ferdinand 
I in April 1848 introduced a new legal and social platform for the Hungarian 
people The Austrian military forces however remained loyal to the monarch 
That condition gained importance when the new emperor the young Franz 
Joseph I revoked the April Laws The legal offence was accompanied by a 
military campaign against the revolutionary Hungarian government The 
nonviolent Spring Revolution of 1848 grew into a total and brutal civil war by 
the autumn and in 1849 the Emperor defeated the Hungarian revolutionary 
forces aided by a Russian army the Russian Empire was almost untouched 
by the revolution Kossuth went into lifelong exile and the leaders of the army 
were executed The failed revolution was followed by a period of authoritarian 
political rule 
By 1848 the British Chartist movement was widespread particularly in 
the industrial north When news came of a revolution in Paris the Chartists 
moment appeared to have come Yet when the expected government 
clampdown arrived the Chartist leader Fearghus OConnor 17961855 failed 
to decide between violent revolution or moderation and in the process the 
movement fatally lost momentum Ireland retained serious revolutionary 
potential For years even moderates like Daniel OConnell 17751847 in 
his ultimately unsuccessful campaign to repeal the 1800 Act of Union used 
the threat of revolution in Ireland to gain political leverage In his monster 
meetings he sent a clear message to the British government grant reform 
or face revolution from these unstoppable forces In 1848 another potential 
powderkeg came with a shortlived rebellion in Ireland then in the grip of a 
devastating famine The Young Irelanders clearly saw their abortive action as 
part of the European wave of revolution but the result was underwhelming 
and limited to scuffles in a rural district rather than barricades in Dublin
