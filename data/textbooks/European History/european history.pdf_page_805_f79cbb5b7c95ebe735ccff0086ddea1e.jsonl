highperforming and austerityprone north reactivated the longestablished 
division of Europe along the northsouth axis These images of idleness and 
excessiveness building in part on an older repertoire of stereotyped imagery 
of south Europe should not blind us to the role of the north or the core in 
costructuring the vulnerable economy of the region such as the volatility of 
mass tourism and foreign loans Likewise it was the core that profited from 
the cheap labour of migrating southern European and Yugoslavian guest 
workers who helped build the economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s in 
northwestern Europe Central Europe too has been subject to orientalising 
discourses of Eastness Tomasz Zarycki produced by the Western core 
while also producing these images itself Unquestioned acceptance of Western 
norms and models efforts to assert a distinctively Central European identity 
but also a critical stance towards what some see as Western European moral 
corruption and colonisation are some of the ways in which the region copes 
with its semiperipheral status defined by and in relation to the Western 
core Other ways of coping with the semiperipheral status are some political 
projects such as Intermarium a midtwentieth century plan for an East
Central European federation controlled by Poland or ideas on how the region 
might breed morally superior models of civilisation 
Microscale
Further down the spatial scale many centreperiphery relations were also at 
play on a microlevel within the centres and peripheries of Europe or within 
individual states It would be wrong for instance to imagine twentiethcentury 
France as a monolithic core country Rather a regional discrepancy evolved in 
the nineteenth century and crystallised in the twentieth between industrialising 
northern France and its increasingly agricultural south Regional discrepancies 
between the rich Italian north and the poor Italian south are even more 
pronounced From the perspective of urban geography the core region of rich 
heavily populated and globally significant cities has established an Urban

Paris Milan Munich and Hamburg Or in Roger Brunets Blue Banana a 
curved belt can be observed stretching from the English midlands to northern 
Italy Peripheries spread out to the east and west of these formations
Whether a particular country was part of the European centre or its 
peripheries smaller internal peripheries have tended to emerge within
or have remained in existence from previous periods Regions that were 
comparatively less industrialised less urbanised poorly connected and 
circumvented by railroads and motorways tended towards a high rate of 
outmigration In the first half of the twentieth century the southern belt
