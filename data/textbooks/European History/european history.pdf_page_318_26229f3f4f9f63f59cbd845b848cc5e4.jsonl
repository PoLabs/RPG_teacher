the desire to acquire land and control over trade routes which resulted in large
scale territorial expansion To legitimise their domination many imperialists 
developed feelings of cultural superiority over allegedly primitive natives 
And crucially prestige territorial and economic gains fed into a common 
European race for the best shares of the spoil
Analytically it makes sense to distinguish between different imperial types 
Many see the key distinction in basic geography and patterns of conquest 
and rule thus differentiating between contiguous landed formations such 
as the Habsburg Ottoman and Russian empires and maritime powers with 
territorial extensions andor colonial possessions overseas including the 
Spanish Portuguese and British empires This does not mean that contiguous 
empires could not have colonies it only means that they acquired and viewed 
these possessions differently 
While maritime empires depended on strong navies landed empires tended 
to expand by absorbing neighbouring territories In both cases local resistance 
could be fierce which meant that imperial expansion and rule were often 
ensured by coercion Some early modern states including the Holy Roman 
Empire under Habsburg rule engaged in matrimonial imperialism that is 
the use of marriage bonds between dynasties to bring vast territories under 
their control with little military action Some of Europes naval powers also 
used private companies such as the Dutch and British East India companies to 
pursue commercial interests along distant coasts acting just as exploitatively 
as other imperialists but with less concern for statebuilding and colonisation 
The Spanish and Portuguese empires in turn replicated the model of European 
kingdoms and imposed this model on native societies
While these distinctions may be useful we must remember that all empires 
were in constant movement and at different times driven by extractive 
tributary territorial religious and other concerns Further as the British 
approach in Ireland and America suggests they could pursue different colonial 
policies at the same time
Emerging Empires
Between 1450 and 1550 the Spanish and Portuguese monarchies started 
building vast overseas empires Their geographical patterns of expansion were 
the result of a mixture of foresight experience and accident
While the Portuguese had been exploring the Atlantic for longer the 
Spanish moved across the ocean in the late fifteenth century Starting from 
their first Caribbean land falls they expanded west and southwest to the 
American mainland following the trail of the Aztec and Inca empires In 1494 
Spanish and Portuguese representatives agreed in Tordesillas to divide global 
spheres of influence between them establishing a meridian in the Atlantic the
