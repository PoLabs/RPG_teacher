monarchies In bi or multinational states competing nationalisms caused 
severe political tensions in the late nineteenth century and undermined 
political stability even where minority rights were guaranteed by law 
One would assume that competing nationalisms provoked increasingly 
bitter conflict within local and urban communities in the second half of 
the nineteenth century too but that would be a misunderstanding of the 
complexity of local conditions Nationalist agendas were articulated in the 
public space in the press in associations and in parliament but at the same 
time longstanding practices of interethnic communication and coexistence 
continued to characterise everyday life on the local level 
In the age of mass migration the proximity of old and new ethnic groups 
the appearance of culturally different newcomers and particularly the rapid 
change which altered the former ethnic and linguistic composition of towns 
and cities all together created the potential for conflicts within urban societies 
However larger cities also functioned as crucibles where the linguistic and 
cultural assimilation of minority groups proved much faster than in ethnically 
homogeneous isolated regions
