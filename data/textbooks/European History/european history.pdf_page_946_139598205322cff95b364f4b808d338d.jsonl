The oldest chronicles on the region date from the late Middle Ages which 
began in Central Europe after the 1350s Lauban today Luba in Poland is 
an appropriate example It had about 6000 inhabitants and was located in an 
extremely important position on the trade route called the Via Regia Royal 
Route
The chronicles of the town flourished in the sixteenth century with the 
arrival of a new generation of Protestant humanisteducated historians Many 
of them were members of the municipal administration others were teachers 
or Lutheran clergymen They sought to craft a history of the town from its 
earliest days in accounts which stressed patriotism and Christian especially 
Lutheran morals This concept is clearly demonstrated in the introductory 
chapters of town chronicles where authors often referred to wellknown 
historians from the Classical era Apart from this the main goal was to celebrate 
their Patria Fatherland usually meaning the town where they were born or 
where they lived When writing about the Middle Ages they used older local 
chronicles as well as a variety of other resources as sources of information
A number of Upper Lusatian chronicles displayed a traditional cyclical 
approach to history and time summarising events like epidemics great 
fires executions floods tragic deaths frosts and heatwaves storms periods 
of economic difficulty and more In this context the descriptions of key 
moments and crises nevertheless challenged more static perceptions of 
time These crises of history were decisive points shaping regional historical 
awareness and identity We can identify four such key moments in the history 
of Upper Lusatia from the ancient era through to the seventeenth century 
Christianisation and the founding of towns the towns evolving relationship 
with the ruling dynasty the reflection of the Utraquist movement and the 
effect of the Hussite Wars and the Protestant Reformation and the process of 
consolidation of the new Protestant denominations
Regional awareness developed among the burgher elites of Lauban Writers 
focused on the earliest roots of their towns and formed the towns identity 
based on its supposed ancient character its links to the rulers of Bohemia 
the Holy Roman Empire and Brandenburg its early adoption of Christianity 
and Lutheranism and the Slavic presence there They created a fairly stable 
record of the towns early history which was extended up until the nineteenth 
century but they very often lacked a clear concept of wider history More often 
these writers described a mere sequence of events emphasising moments of 
crisis Their main goals were to serve as a source of information for the people 
of their town as well as to offer them moral guidance
