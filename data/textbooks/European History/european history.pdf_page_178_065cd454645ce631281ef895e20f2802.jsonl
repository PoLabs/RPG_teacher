Population policies became the subject of passionate discussions At one end of 
the debate stood the populationists who were seeking to promote the growth 
of the birth rate At the other end were the socalled NeoMalthusians who 
promoted low fertility through contraception in order to improve the living 
standards of the lower classes Not only the quantity but also the quality of 
the population became an important issue of the time Eugenics belonged to 
scientific discourse Numerous supporters of eugenicist selection could be 
found among the socialists and liberals as well as among the nationalists These 
tendencies culminated in the 1930s in the German National Socialist practice 
of forced sterilisation This idea came from the USA and we can also find it 
in other European countries of that time such as Sweden 1934 or Norway 
1934
Second Break The Second World War and the Postwar 
Baby Boom
The Second World War is estimated to have cost sixtyfive million peoples 
lives worldwide with the highest number of losses in a single state being 
the Soviet Unions estimated twentyseven million victims As for Germany 
the figures of losses vary between 65 and seven million people whereas 
Poland lost six million and Yugoslavia 17 million lives These total figures 
form a larger picture by including all groups of victims But the demographic 
landscape across Europe also changed from an ethnic viewpoint for example 
European Jews were almost entirely extinguished or expelled by the Nazis 
and their collaborationists 
In the years directly following the war forced migration continued as 
the example of Germany shows between 1945 and 1950 around 6 million 
people mostly ethnic Germans were forced to migrate from other countries 
in Central and Eastern Europe to postwar Germany now divided between 
East and West There was moreover a significant migration movement from 
East to West in Germany an estimated four million people migrated between 
1946 and 1961 until the Berlin Wall and the closure of the interGerman 
border halted large scale migrations without entirely ending them Despite 
population growth throughout the 1950s and 1960s the rapidly growing 
German economy needed more manpower Consequently West Germany 
signed a series of bilateral contracts with countries such as Greece Turkey 
or Yugoslavia This led to an influx of workers and later their relatives 
known as guest workers Gastarbeiter Low wages and a lack of currency 
convertibility did not make the region behind the Iron Curtain an attractive 
migration destination Yet labour migration was not completely new as proven 
by the example of East Germany where contract workers Vertragsarbeiter
