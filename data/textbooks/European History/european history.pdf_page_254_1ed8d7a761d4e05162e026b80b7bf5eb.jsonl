The search for equality was revolutionary However it was also marked by 
very significant attempts to limit the scope of just how such equality would be 
applied Notably white men with some level of property settled in a town or 
city were the main beneficiaries in theory and in practice of ideas of equality 
For the popular classesworkers without recognised property women and 
all othersan unequal social system whose basic traits had emerged and 
been consolidated in the Middle Ages endured well into the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries in many regions of Europe
Gender Inequality and the Family
A useful example for understanding how deeply inequality was entrenched 
in the system is the family Many books in many different languages were 
written on the administration of households and the different roles that 
men and women held within them In fact before the rise of capitalism and 
of strong commercial and mercantile societies the term economy referred 
to the rules of the household From around 1500 to 1800 this literature and 
other sources depicted the family as a group of unequal individuals within 
which the father held a particular type of authority over his wife servants 
and descendants This paternal authority was hierarchical and had nothing 
to do with the limited horizontal political and social relationships that could 
operate in the governance of cities guilds and parliaments The family was 
a sphere that other powers were not allowed to enter Although wives were 
relatively better positioned than servants and the offspring of the familial unit 
the enduring effects of paternal authority underpinned many elements of the 
marginalisation and inequality of women 
The family was often used as a model or a metaphor to refer to the whole 
political structure of early modern societies Major political thinkers such as 
the French theorist of sovereignty Jean Bodin or the English theorists Robert 
Filmer and John Locke reflected on the similitudes between families organised 
hierarchically and inherently unequal and different aspects of political order 
Kings and rulers were often considered to extend a paternal care to their 
subjects although the extent and obligations of this patriarchal authority 
were debated and coexisted with systems of restricted political representation 
parliaments and other political bodies Conversely wellordered families 
with a balanced distribution of male public roles and feminine administrative 
activities and caring duties were considered to be the basis of a stable social 
order Religious reformers including Puritans and more radical sects also 
considered families and paternal control key to maintaining the religious 
foundations of such order
