depression in the United States US AustriaHungary Germany France and

the Great Depression which subsided only with the preparations for the Second 
World War The subsequent decades of economic growth were cut short by the 
socalled oil crisis in 1973 which caused a worldwide depression The last 
crisis of that magnitude was the 2008 crash of the US mortgage securitisation 
market All these events shaped the development of the modern European 
economy and provide markers for a different periodisation of economic 
history That said the major events of the twentieth centurythe First and
