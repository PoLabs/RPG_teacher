Catholicism in the nineteenth century took on a less severe more 
indulgent and more sentimental face than before The pastoral care of 
fear Jean Delumeau inherited from the Middle Ages gradually gave 
way in the middle of the century thanks to the spread of the more flexible 
moral theology of Alphonsus Liguori 16961787 proclaimed a Doctor of the 
Church in 1871 The priestly generations were being renewed and Roman 
and antiJansenist ideas progressed among the clergythe tone had changed 
markedly The preaching of hell receded and that of purgatory returned to 
the forefront The clergy became more prudent prompted by their awareness 
of the importance of voluntary abstention from the sacraments particularly 
among men and the problems posed by the spread of contraceptive practices

preachers began to argue in favour of frequent communion HenriDominique 
Lacordaire 18021861 in 1851 at NotreDame de Paris publicly attacked the 
thesis of the small number of the chosen that had long been dominant in 
theology The multiplication and spread of particular devotions testify to the 
continuing movement towards the individualisation of belief which lent itself 
to a more affective and warmhearted kind of piety
This change in religious sensibilities went far beyond the borders of the 
Catholic world Throughout Europe in reaction to the Enlightenment and 
the coldness of reason romanticism emphasised the exaltation of feeling and 
nature First taking shape in Germany and England this romanticism spread 
throughout Europe and was expressed in literature painting and religion 
After the French Revolution the romantics regretted the loss of belief at a 
time when the rise of science was promoting scepticism or even a generalised 
atheism These plural romanticisms nourished different Protestant revivalist 
movements defending a more existential and sentimental piety awakened 
from a faith judged to be stale or mundane The revivals aimed to bring about 
a more existential and demonstrative piety based on personal experience 
rather than on adherence to a teaching The revelations were a protest against 
a predominantly intellectualist religion with a strong emphasis on feeling in 
line with the romantic sensibility and the definition of faith as feeling by the 
German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher Launched in the mideighteenth 
century by Anglican preachers George Whitefield and John Wesley in the 
United Kingdom and then in America the revivals reached Frenchspeaking 
countries in the 1820s to 1850s
