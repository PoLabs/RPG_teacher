Introduction
In the Middle Ages as the Roman Empire receded into the past the Catholic 
Church took over as a major force for European integration But by the end 
of this period Europes centre of commercial gravity was gradually shifting 
northwards from the Mediterranean system to the Hanseatic systemfrom a 
civilisational lake around which peoples ideas and products circulated to the 
mercantile lake of the Baltic Sea In the fifteenth century Ottoman expansion 
in the eastern Mediterranean further affected the commercial activity of 
Venice and Genoa setting them on a path of terminal decline This prompted 
a number of experiments in Atlantic exploration based on Genoese seafaring 
knowledge and led by the Portuguese Atlantic navigation in the fifteenth 
century led to an intense pursuit of military conquest and conflict on the west 
coast of Africa the Canary Islands and the Azores On the Atlantic frontier of 
both the Mediterranean and Hanseatic systems sat two seemingly peripheral 
territories the Iberian Peninsula which spearheaded European expansion in 
the sixteenth century somewhat unexpectedly and Britain which had become 
the dominant maritime power by the late eighteenth century 
Between 1450 and 1800 direct knowledge about the multiple parts and 
peoples of the globe was continuously expanding through exploration 
trade and military confrontations Merchants missionaries and mercenaries
