the core group of the movement in associations trade unions and parties In 
the first half of the century journeymen and workers in the puttingout system 
were active in Luddismthat is following the example of the Luddites and 
destroying machineryas forms of action beyond associational models Later 
in the century factory workers increasingly participated in these organisations 
as well Especially in the labour parties which emerged in the 1860s leftwing 
intellectuals also played an important role
The ideological groundings of the labour movements were shaped by 
intellectuals as well as labourers In France and Germany socalled craft 
socialism became very prominent promoting the idea that a just and equal 
society could be crafted Likewise the demands of the democratic Chartist 
movement in England which aimed to give the labouring class a political voice 
by pleading for universal suffrage for men were formulated and carried by 
skilled workers Such socialistcommunist ideas culminated in the Manifesto 
of the Communist Party a pamphlet written by the German philosophers Karl 
Marx 18181883 and Friedrich Engels 18201895 and published in 1848 The 
Manifesto was above all an analysis of past and present class struggles and of 
how the capitalist society would eventually evolve into a socialist society 
The influence of the manifesto would remain limited for decades after its 
publication but its ideas were ultimately adopted and used as the foundation 
of labour movements across Europe albeit in different ways For example in 
Great Britain a closer connection between labour and liberals existed while 
in Southern Europe anarchist movements gained influence The aims and 
values of labour movements were threefold First they aimed at improving 
working conditions through higher wages shorter working hours and valuing 
physical work Second their political demands focussed on participation 
democratisation and freedom Third an equal society solidarity and a vision 
of a classless society represented the social aims of the labour movement 
In the fight for respect as worker and citizen these aims coalesced and found 
symbols metaphors and cultural expression The aims of whitecollar 
organisations which developed very late in the nineteenth century however 
concentrated much more on preserving their already privileged positions in 
society and at work 
To achieve their aims the labour movement possessed a great variety of 
practices and actions Luddism as a direct form of violence disappeared in the 
first half of the nineteenth century due to more effective forms of protest and 
more durable and powerful organisations Instead strikes became a powerful 
weapon ranging from smallscale events on the shop floor to nationwide mass 
strikes In the organisation of these strikes trade unions played an important 
role although they sometimes shied away from using this weapon where futile 
strikes could imperil their organisations Besides grassroots activism and trade
