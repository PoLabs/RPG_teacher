union organisations political engagement and political associations came to 
the fore Although political labour parties faced state persecution throughout 
Europe their success in many countries demonstrated that persecution was 
not the answer to this politicalsocietal rise of the labouring class In addition 
mutual help and insurance fostered solidarity among the workers and was an 
important starting point for national insurance schemes against the risks of 
illness unemployment work accidents and old age beginning from the late 
nineteenth century Finally international cooperation strengthened the power 
of the labour movements and demonstrated the importance of transnational 
networkingthat this ideal of transnational cooperation would ultimately 
collapse in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War was not foreseeable 
in the nineteenth century
Despite their success labour movements contained unsolved problems 
Because the labour unions and parties had their origins in craft traditions and 
associational organisation patterns they mainly represented skilled workers 
In striving for respectability the lumpenproletariatas the lowest societal

Paris population against the conservativemonarchic government leading 
to the first political instance of a council republic The supporters favoured

In general nineteenthcentury revolutions were liberal middleclass actions 
fighting for parliamentarism democracy and political freedom These were 
also the aims of the labour movements But the labour movements fight 
for social equality and against exploitation and alienation did not turn into

class also remained limited In Great Britain the cooperation between liberals 
and labour helped the trade unionists enter parliament In France individual
