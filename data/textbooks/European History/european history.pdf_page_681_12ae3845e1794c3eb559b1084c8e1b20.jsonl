the two other sectors with the rural nonagricultural population in the North 
Sea Region averaging around twentyseven to twentyeight percent with no 
discernible changes from 1500 levels in Southern Europe Still there occurred 
an overall decline of Europes agricultural population which fell to around 
sixty percent with even lower rates in England and the Low Countries at 
around fortyfive percent
These shifts occurred as Europes population grew from around 70 million 
1500 to around 130 million 1800 Demographic change was neither steady 
nor geographically uniform with marked increases before the Thirty Years 
War 16181648 and after the mideighteenth century Still it is also an 
indicator ofat leastcommensurate increases of economic output and thus 
it may serve as a crude proxy for overall productivity gains
From the late medieval period onwards Europeans achieved incremental 
gains in agricultural and manufacturing output glass textiles printing 
seafaring science observation theory and material accumulation that to a 
certain degree exceeded population growth These advances varied widely 
did not last and differed considerably from region to region depending 
mainly on the natural environment and preexisting social formations social 
orders as well as the availability of resources and labour
Most protoindustrial enterprises eg mining processing were typically 
concentrated outside urban centres and made use of all kinds of labour eg 
free partially free andor unfree labour Economic activity relied virtually 
exclusively on organic materials wood and traditional energy inputs muscle 
water and wind power Hence productivity gains were often the consequence 
of organisational modifications of societal command and control differentials 
which manifested themselves differently ranging from incentivised pressures 
to increased authority of the landowners In short as early modern Europes 
output increased its labour force also grew more regimented and disciplined
Free Wage Labour
Free labour refers to individuals and groups who sold their labour to the 
highest bidder in exchange for a daily monthly or annual wage While free 
workers may refrain from engaging in any kind of labour a lack of savings 
and the need to sustain themselves served as primary incentives to enter the 
labour market In a competitive labour market wages received would be 
determined by ones marginal productivity thereforeat least in theorythe 
more productive a worker was the higher the wage that worker would receive
Before the Industrial Revolution productivity gains were due to skills and 
specialisation rather than technological improvements Labour may further be 
subdivided into unskilled and skilled workers who possessed different levels
