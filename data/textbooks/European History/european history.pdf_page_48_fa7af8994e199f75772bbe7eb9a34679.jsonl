The International Federation of Trade Unions IFTU founded in 1919 
proposed a less widereaching concept of a united Europe They advocated a 
European customs union merely as an intermediate step towards a fundamental 
global economic policy In 1925 the Social Democratic Party of Germany SPD 
adopted a new programme the socalled Heidelberg Programme in which 
the SPD underscored its commitment to strive for a European economic entity 
by democratic means and emphasised that the abolition of trade barriers 
would be the first step towards the creation of the United States of Europe 
Many of the newly formed states in East and SouthEast Europe such as 
Czechoslovakia and Romania were composed of heterogeneous parts and 
had toquite literallyput themselves on the map They engaged in nation
building activities and had to fight for their own survival in the new postwar 
order seeking their own geopolitical patrons While CoudenhoveKalergis 
PanEuropean proposals had some resonance with Eastern European states 
there was a more pressing issue for these nations namely that of Central 
Europe The question of how to manage the legacy of the AustroHungarian 
empire after its collapse engendered many plans proposals and visions for a 
new order in the region For example Masaryks book The New Europe The Slav 
Standpoint Nov Evropa Stanovisko slovansk 1918 proposed an antiGerman 
Central Europe based on Slavic nations a united Poland Czechoslovakia 
and Yugoslavia The German ideas of a Mitteleuropa Middle Europe or a 
Zwischeneuropa Inbetween Europe were also influential in this debate The 
latter concept had a geopolitical connotation since it envisaged a political 
conglomerate separating the West from Hintereuropa End Europe a term 
denoting Russia 
The concept of a Mitteleuropa had been articulated in 1915 by the German 
liberal politician Friedrich Naumann 18601919 His plan proposed voluntary 
economic cooperation and integration as well as the substitution of sovereign 
nation states for national autonomies Naumanns ideas caused intense 
debates in Hungary and other countries included in the plan The central 
question was whether economic integration meant economic and political 
subordination to Germany The economic background to Naumanns plan was 
the fact that Germany had overtaken the hereditary provinces of the Habsburg 
Monarchy as dominant investors in the region As the states of the East and 
SouthEast of Europe were mostly agrarian they had to decide if they could 
accept these very German proposals There was a cleavage between agrarian 
and mercantile viz industrial interests Those representing the interests of 
largescale farming were in favour of the Middle Europe Plan while those 
representing the countrys largescale industry were against it
