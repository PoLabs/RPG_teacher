Baron Haussmanns neoconservative reconstruction of Paris in which 
some 27000 buildings were destroyed and some 100000 rebuilt became not 
only a model of efficient traffic management ie boulevards connecting train 
stations and empire aesthetics ie splendid views of monumental buildings 
but also that of the political control over the revolutionary urban crowds who 
could defend themselves less easily against the shots of the artillery in the 
widened avenues and boulevards Whereas renewed urban centres with new 
buildings and a new system of streets were immediately occupied by the new 
bourgeois class the sordid situation of the areas inhabited by the working 
class remained mostly unaddressed before the Garden City movement The 
ideologies and the experimental settlements of the Utopian thinkers such 
as Charles Fouriers Phalanstres and Robert Owens cooperative movement 
which proposed inspiring solutions to the social evils of capitalist society

Labour and Class Struggles 
The nineteenth century was marked by vigorous growth but also by strong 
socioeconomic inequalities The social question was very much on the agenda 
in the European countries that had been won over by industrialisation now 
concerned with improving the living health and working conditions of the 
increasingly numerous working class 
The first social surveys date back to the first third of the nineteenth century 
and highlight the difficult conditions of housing food hygiene and working 
environments created by emergent industrialisation Surveys were carried out 
by hygienists such as Dr James Phillips Kay in Great Britain or Dr Villerm in 
France or by other reformers throughout Europe These observers measured 
poverty across the continent with terrible findingsparticularly accentuated 
by epidemics such as cholera which swept through Europe in the early 1830s 
In the middle of the nineteenth century the life expectancy of a worker did not 
exceed twentyfive years from Manchester to Rouen
Paternalism was one response to the social question formulated by the 
large industrial families they would provide housing guarantee security of 
work and access to careincluding maternity care as for example with the 
Schneider family in Le Creusot or the Krupp family in Essen
Responses to the deterioration in workers conditions of employment are 
numerous and do not all follow the same path From the beginning of the 
century philanthropistswho were sometimes industrialists themselves
