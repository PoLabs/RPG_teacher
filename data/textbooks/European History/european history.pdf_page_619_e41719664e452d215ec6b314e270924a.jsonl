First of all we need to differentiate between practices and cases of 
inequality of income of wealth and of rights Overall we have more data on 
inequality of wealth than of inequality of income as the sources tracing the 
daily or annual income of households are even more scarce than sources on 
accumulated wealth As the discussion above on ideas and norms has made 
clear premodern societies were marked by vast inequalities in terms of who 
had the right to hold a property was allowed to perform a type of work or to 
engage in a commercial activity For example many craft guilds throughout 
Europe upheld restrictions in terms of ancestry birth in a jurisdiction and 
gender as to who could engage in a particular type of craft These inequalities in 
terms of rights in their turn affected the income and wealth one could acquire 
At the same time guilds could also implement restrictions for example on 
the maximum number of tools a craftsman could own or the number of 
journeymen a master could hire thus preventing rising inequality within the 
craft itself
Another form of inequality in rights that influenced the rise or moderation 
of wealth inequality was inheritance law Throughout Europe various types of 
legislation determined how capital could be transferred from one generation 
to the next Some of these regimes favoured the firstborn son thus facilitating 
the increasing concentration of wealth over generations Other legal regimes 
put up hurdles to sell parts of an inheritance on the market thus preventing 
further wealth concentration by investors
Inequality of income and of wealth could be seen in the economic situations 
of particular regions and cities Throughout the period various places became 
centres of trade and production that attracted merchants and labour migrants 
from near and far This was the case in for example Antwerp throughout 
the sixteenth century and in Amsterdam a century later Some people from 
a modest background indeed were able to make a fortune there However 
these places were sites of rising inequality that condemned many to economic 
hardship
The economic booms of commercial cities should not let us forget that 
the majority of the population of early modern Europe spent their lives in 
the countryside Agricultural activities were the main form of work for most 
people In most rural communities inequality was also rising It should be 
noted however that rates of wealth inequality in villages were generally less 
high than in urban areas Again legal regimes local customs and forms of local 
selforganisation and coordination could mitigate or counter these trends That 
selforganisation could take the form of protest and contestation but it could 
also take the form of installing forms of taxation that had a moderating effect 
on inequality Premodern taxes were often regressive falling hardest on the 
poor and contributing to increasing levels of wealth and income inequality
