Europe as a Cognitive Order
This leads to the second important way in which Europe was conceptualised
as a cognitive order The emergence and the consolidation of the idea of Europe 
in the early modern period was predicated on the entanglement of shared 
notions notions which suggested Europe consisted of a particular political 
order dominated by composite states a particular religion a Christian faith 
deemed catholic in the sense of universal or a particular culture built 
on a Roman heritage and a Christian tradition Speaking about Europeans 
implied that there were others not just in a geographical sense but in 
political religious and cultural terms Uncultured peoples like Moscovites 
Scythians Tartars Cimmerians Travellers or religious others such as Turks 
Persians Arabs andmore problematicallyJews while displaying some 
cultured traits were still perceived as not adequate to the notion of civilisation
