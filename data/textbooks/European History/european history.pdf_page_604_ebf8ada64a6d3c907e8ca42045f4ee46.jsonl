managerial organisation However this modern form of enterprise mainly 
developed in North America where markets were far away from their 
suppliers 
The nationstate system in Europe did not allow for the establishment of a 
single market similar to the United States Not only were markets territorially 
fragmented but consumers were also not as far from producers as they were in 
the American case There was no need for a manufacturing firm to control the 
sales of their own products Production processing and manufacturing firms 
as well as commercial ones trading houses were detached from each other 
and there was no serious need to integrate the productive and the commercial 
functions Family firms wereand still aremuch more common in Europe 
than in the United States 
This started to change during the first half of the twentieth century While 
the nineteenthcentury economy had been characterised by the concentration 
of the factors of production ie land labour and capital the First World War 
and the Great Depression complicated this process While the tendency of 
conglomerationie business enterprises getting bigger and biggerwas 
obvious on both sides of the Atlantic the reactions to that tendency were 
different In North America antitrust laws were introduced and enforced On 
the European continent cartels a form of restricting competition were not 
abolished on the contrary coordination between enterprises in certain sectors 
was openly encouraged and developed
The fact that capitalist economies differed in Europe and the United States 
raised the question of which model was betterthat is which model was more 
stable more functional and better for society as a whole There were however 
no simple answers even though economists across the globe debated this issue 
and economic theory throughout the twentieth century very much centred on 
the question of how to build stable and prosperous economic systems
Command Economies in Eastern Europe 
In the context of the First World War governments across the globe started 
to introduce strict measures to regulate national and international markets 
Tolls were introduced or raised taxes increased and import and export quotas 
were enforced to protect national markets and to ensure that supply chains 
for important goods were upheld After the war revolutionary movements 
gained in strength across Europe especially in the countries that had lost the 
war In terms of business relations many of these revolutionary movements 
and parties were rather conservative and argued for even tighter market 
regulations and governmentenforced economic measures
