remembrance The roles of capitals big cities midsized cities and small towns 
varied in these efforts to represent a national story While capitals became the 
focal points of national identity thanks to their wealth of cultural institutions 
ie museums theatres opera houses research universities and other big 
cities and regional centres strove to achieve cultural significance through 
the establishment of similar institutions small towns gradually began to 
be perceived as backward and incongruent with modern sensibilities The 
construction of nineteenthcentury European urban heritage can be understood 
via the paradox of modernisationthe paradox being that modernisation was 
a source of development and yet simultaneously generated nostalgia for the 
traditional world that this very development destroyed Depending on their 
level of dynamism cities acted and were regarded as agents of modernisation 
orconverselyas guardians of traditional values and activities against 
cultural centralisation and ruthless industrialisation
A citys dynamism was shaped by the role that it played in urbanisation 
Urbanisation as a demographic process affected large midsized and smaller 
cities and towns all of which together gradually constituted an urban hierarchy 
across Europe described as structural urbanisation The growing number and 
size of population concentrations are described as demographic urbanisation As 
a result of this process in the nineteenth century modern urban life became 
an everyday reality for millions of people as metropolitan life did for dozens 
of millions of people whether they lived in cities or not they got involved in 
urban behaviour and participated in urban modes of thought and activitya 
process which is described as behavioural urbanisation The construction of urban 
heritage in individual cities was codetermined by the local characteristics of 
this triple process of urbanisation
Though the concept of soft power was unknown in the nineteenth century 
European powers gradually expanded their economic and military rivalry to 
the domain of culture and the preservation of monuments By the last third of 
the nineteenth century great powers were expected to possess the necessary 
expertise and institutions for both national and local as well as international 
and global monument protection Urban heritage was integrated into the 
register of national and local heritage through the demarcation of historic 
cities or quarters and the protection of noteworthy historical monuments In 
an urban context these monuments were not necessarily Gothic cathedrals 
or royal palaces but could simply be typical urban edifices The preservation 
of the remains of Crosby Hall in London provides one example This fine 
secular example of medieval domestic architecture in London a rare survivor 
of the Great Fire of 1666 narrowly escaped destruction as the result of a public 
campaign initiated in the 1830s and led by antiquarians and men of letters 
In the same decade the first state institutions dedicated to the protection of 
historical monuments were created in France
