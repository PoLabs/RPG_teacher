Introduction
The nineteenth century is often viewed as the birthplace of heritage because 
of the establishment during this period of socalled GLAM institutions
Galleries Libraries Archives and Museums As highlighted in the seminal 
work of British sociologist Tony Bennett it was in the aftermath of the French 
Revolution that heritage became a public good used primarily by the state to 
foster nationalism and modern norms and ideas around the industrial political 
economy and scientific progress The birth of the nation state ensured the 
development of a concerted interest in heritage and memory not only because 
of the role it served as a tool for cultural governance but also because of a 
growing pressure on the historic environment due to industrialisation and 
fastpaced modernisation
At first glance the twentieth century can seem like a postscript to the previous 
century when modern ideas first became normalised However the post1918 
period is significant in the context of heritage and memory for a number of 
reasons first heritage became further institutionalised and bureaucratised 
second mass tourism and post1945 development led to a heritage boom 
and third academic interest in heritage and memory grew to such an extent 
that the new subdisciplines of heritage and memory became dominant fields 
in the humanities In this chapter we will first broadly outline the growing 
interest in heritage and memory in and beyond academia Subsequently we 
will zoom in on key domains of heritage and memory practice in Europe 
in the twentieth century As Europe witnessed a series of violent conflicts 
during this period we will discuss developments in the field of postconflict 
memorialisation Urban heritage developments will also be explored Finally
