early modern period as European interaction with the nonEuropean world 
intensified During the first period of European expansion in the early 
modern period known as the Columbian Exchange Europeans did not 
generally use physical features to classify humanity and thus whiteness 
blackness and so on did not yet exist as identity markers or sociological 
categories Rather language and especially religion were the most important 
basis for the creation of classificatory systems Climatic theorythe idea that 
geography and environmental factors broadly construed impact physical 
and psychological character on the individual and the collective levelalso 
played a role in classificatory schemes both within and beyond Europe Such 
a perspective could work against the creation of fixed racial categories as the 
idea that Europeans began to look and behave like the indigenous population 
was a very common trope from the beginning of the Columbian Exchange that 
lasted throughout the eighteenth century For example JeanBaptiste Demanet 
was not unusual in reporting in his Nouvelle Histoire de lAfrique franaise New 
History of French Africa 1767 that there was a colony of Portuguese settlers in 
west Africa who had become black over a few generations without any mixing 
with the indigenous population
Religion could be involved in the creation of racialised systems however 
In what is arguably the first example of thinking in terms of heritable and 
therefore racial inequalities in the postclassical world the doctrine of 
limpieza de sangre purity of blood developed on the Iberian Peninsula in the 
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as a background to various discriminatory 
laws enacted against Jews even against the many thousands of Jews who had 
converted to Christianity known as New Christians The hallmark of racist 
thinkingthat a given ethnic group is inherently and inescapably inferior or 
suspect in some waymarked this new form of discrimination and formed 
part of the background to the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492
But paradoxical as it may seem a racist ideology of inequality did not lie 
behind the European imperial projects of the early modern period because 
these were premised on the idea that all peoples are part of a single human 
species with a shared ancestry who must be exposed to the teachings of Jesus 
Christ and that all nonEuropeans canand shouldlive like Christian 
Europeans Europeans required Native American knowledge to survive in the 
New World and learned about the many differences among Native American 
peoples in terms of customs language and history factors that militated 
against the construction of an allencompassing Native American race And 
although the transatlantic slave trade and the strong racial element of New 
World slavery would seem to lend themselves to the creation of race as a 
fundamental category of inegalitarian thought Europeans had to respect local 
African political authority and the myriad differences among subSaharan
