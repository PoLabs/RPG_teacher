were all outside the scope of such surveys Finally as all of these records 
served tax purposes in one way or another many people had no interest in 
being included in these lists Those who tried to evade taxes therefore remain 
invisible until or even after the introduction of censuses Therefore whenever 
precise population estimatesof different polities the death tolls of epidemics 
famines military conflicts and so onare presented in the context of early 
modern times one must be very cautious with the figures 
That said major advances in data collection have enabled the creation of 
databases in which individuals are trackable across time and space allowing 
scholars to find the same person again in data from a later census Another big 
impetus to the field has come through close collaboration with genealogists 
using crowdsourcing techniques and citizen science projects to record 
information about past populations 
Early Modern Demographic Regime Was There a 
Malthusian Equilibrium in Europe 
The Malthusian model has been very influential in historical studies of 
population and resources Malthuss model predicted regular crises since 
food production increases at a linear rate whereas population tends to increase 
exponentially There is some evidence suggesting that this may hold for the 
medieval period and for some regions of Europe up until 1800 Malthus was an 
English minister concerned with what he saw as a recurrent problem that any 
increase in food production led to greater population growth which would 
subsequently literally eat up any gains in living standards thus trapping 
populations at low standards of living and on the edge of subsistence His 
analysis identified a series of positive resulting in higher death rates and 
preventive resulting in lowered birth rates checks on population growth 
These checks might temporarily disrupt the relationship between food 
production and population growth but Malthus was generally pessimistic 
about the longterm potential of populations to overcome this supposedly 
natural tendency towards growth The point at which the population outstrips 
the growth in food production leading to scarcity famine and disease is 
referred to as a Malthusian catastrophe
What we know of the early modern period is that some moments were 
more Malthusian than others European populations do indeed seem to have 
grown faster than food production and living standards were negatively 
affected Owing to the demographic crisis caused by the fourteenthcentury 
Black Death labour was relatively scarce in the late Middle Ages and at the 
beginning of the early modern period This scarcity drove up the wages of 
both men and women and meant that women tended to marry later and have
