Europe as a Geographical Social Political and Economic 
Reality
As a reality Europe can be seen in the first place as a geographical space 
defined by material physical features But while the northern western and 
southern coastal borders could be drawn easily on a map the problematic 
delineation of the eastern limits of Europe confirms the fact that geography 
alone is not sufficient Europe was and is a layered complexity a social reality 
a demographic entity a political entity with a legislation and a military 
complex and an economic trading zone All of these aspects are determined 
to a large extent by geography
However geographyas well as shared culture and in many cases also 
political aspirations andor selfidentifications of their inhabitantsnot only 
created the entity of Europe but in the modern period also split it into sections 
such as those labelled Western Southern Nordic Eastern Central and even 
NorthWest or EastCentral Such designations act as serious categories of 
analysis in modern thought A case in point is the shifting boundaries of 
EastCentral Europe in the early modern period According to the Hungarian

Greece which was increasingly regarded as the cradle of European culture 
The powers in the West of Europe contested the Ottoman membership of 
Europe despite their own mutual antagonisms they felt forced to cooperate in 
containing an empire that they regarded as a mutual enemy They were helped 
by Russia which put itself firmly on the European map in the eighteenth century 
by fighting Swedish aspirations in the Great Northern War 17001721 and by 
attacking Ottoman strongholds at the same time in alliance with the Habsburg 
Monarchy Under the aegis of Tsar Peter I 16721725 Russia adopted 
Western and Enlightenment culture and constructed its own sixteenth and 
seventeenthcentury history as backward and pejoratively medieval If we are 
to believe eighteenthcentury Russian erudites themselves the country only 
became part of Europe during Peters reign Ever since European historians 
have bought into the idea that Russia entered the stage of European history 
only at the end of the seventeenth century Until that time Russia was largely
