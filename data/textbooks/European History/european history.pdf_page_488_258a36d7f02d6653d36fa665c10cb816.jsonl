and the eighteenth centuries in line withif delayed by more than a century
church inculcations and related government efforts Still questions of changes 
in statistical reliability crop up as does the question of factors of short or 
longterm causation
As a result of such critical insights the more neutral concept of social 
control has come to be generally accepted as more suitable than that of social 
discipline This concept takes into account the essentially horizontal mutual 
and social character of norm control and behavioural change At the same 
time it leaves room for the notion that government and church initiatives 
would also influence and at least in the long run inform social control and 
thus at least indirectly shape changes of behaviour To come back to the 
example of homicide and violence by the beginning of the early modern 
period it was still broadly accepted that a violent reaction was a legitimate 
response to an insult to a mans or womans honour Insults in fact were 
themselves considered a form of violence all the more so as they affected not 
just individuals but families neighbours or colleagues too Since the fifteenth 
century however many local authorities stipulated that violence was not a 
legitimate reaction to an insult and ought to be punished while insults to 
someones honour should be brought to court and duly punished rather than 
being avenged on the spot These initiatives took many decades to bear fruit 
but in the long run they do seem to have influenced everyday behaviourif 
only with a considerable delay distorted and redirected by many other factors 
pulling in different directions and in any case only in tandem with changing 
local patterns of social control
Social Utopias
Despite their relatively limited practical application and political success 
explicitly articulated visions proposing reorganisation of social relations 
marked a distinctive break in this era with the medieval traditionsin fact they 
foreshadowed in many respects the progressivism and social engineering of 
the modern era Observing the growing social problems in cities with swelling 
numbers of urban poor and the negative impact of the emerging agricultural 
capitalism on living standards of the peasants intellectuals across Europe 
began to contemplate the role of the state sovereign and community They 
developed radical proposals for a reorganisation of society and its institutions 
based on rationality with an aim to secure welfare for all Equality of citizens 
not only in terms of legal rights but also cultural and even economic equality 
represented a guiding principle of such treatises This call for reform clearly 
traceable in writings of influential humanists and advisors of princes and
