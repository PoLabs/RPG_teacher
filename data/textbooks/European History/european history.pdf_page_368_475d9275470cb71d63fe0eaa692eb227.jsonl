Franz Ferdinand 18631914 by a Serbian nationalist ignited the First World 
War in 1914
The war confirmed that ultimately nationalism was stronger than 
internationalism Rather than maintaining solidarity across class lines most 
socialists and syndicalists joined the patriotic fervour and supported the war 
effort of their respective nations Yet ultimately the general crisis created by 
the war allowed for the Russian Revolution in 1917 which indeed shattered 
the whole continent

liberation of the workers and more While there were many revolutionary 
waves all through the century the Revolutions of 1848 arguably were the 
most consequential a pivotal panEuropean eventthe socalled Springtime 
of Nationsthat gave the period its character and would reverberate even

revolutionary forces that would shape the geopolitical face of the continent in 
the second half of the century and set the stage for the First World War
