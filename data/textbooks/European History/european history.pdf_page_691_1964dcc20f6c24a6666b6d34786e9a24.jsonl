twentieth century However during the nineteenth century countries in 
continental Europe started to catch upespecially the Netherlands Denmark 
and Belgiumand Southern and Eastern European countries also experienced 
significant increases in agricultural output 
Because of these changes the relative share of the total labour force working 
in the agricultural sector significantly decreased in nineteenthcentury Europe 
The rapidly expanding industrial and service sectors absorbed large chunks of 
the agricultural labour force and this decline in agricultural employment was 
made possible by the aforementioned increases in agricultural productivity 
The worldwide relative decrease of the agricultural labour force happened 
gradually starting in Western Europe roughly around 1800 For instance in 
Britain this share dropped from forty percent in 1800 to less than ten percent 
in 1900 and in Belgium from sixtytwo percent to thirtyeight percent in 
the same period Southern and Eastern European labour markets remained 
dominated by agriculture for much longer but here too the agricultural labour 
force would eventually shrinkalthough by 1900 the agricultural sector was 
still the most important employer in these regions It is important to realise 
that an absolute decrease of the agricultural labour force did not occur until 
much later but roughly followed the same pattern as the relative decline ie 
starting in Western Europe around 1850 and slowly moving to other countries 
during the subsequent century 
Besides the regional differences in the relative and absolute size of the 
agricultural population there were also notable differences inside Europe 
in the way labour was organisedparticularly in the use of free and unfree 
labour The medieval institution of serfdom which tied agricultural labourers 
to the land on which they worked in exchange for protection was gradually 
abolished in Western and Central Europe during the early modern era and 
many countries officially abolished this practice during the period of the 
French Revolution Conversely in some Eastern European countries serfdom 
persisted for much longer For instance in Russia serfdom was only abolished 
in 1861 a change that had been set in motion when the country found itself on 
the losing side of the Crimean War 18531856 Right before the emancipation 
of the serfs almost half of the rural population of European Russia was legally 
bound to the land they worked although there were considerable regional 
differences It has been argued that the abolishment of serfdom was an 
important reason for the surge in Russian agricultural productivity during the 
second half of the nineteenth century According to this argument peasants 
were incentivised to work harder and more effectively for instance by making 
better use of technology Therefore one must bear in mind the great social and 
economic impact of the abolition of serfdom in Eastern Europe Elsewhere in 
nineteenthcentury Europe the use of unfree labour was rare People either
