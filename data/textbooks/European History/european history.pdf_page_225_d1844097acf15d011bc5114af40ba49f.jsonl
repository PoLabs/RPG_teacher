The Adult World and the Household
In early modern Europe key stages of adult life were defined by marriage 
work old age and death each of which had an impact on the organisation 
of the household as an institution Much of the historical work on marriage 
in early modern Europe revolves around proving or disproving the claims of 
John Hajnal Hajnal was a mathematician who in 1965 identified a geographic 
line running through Europe from Trieste to St Petersburg which seemed to 
separate Europe into two marriage systems one in the east where marriage 
was universal where women married young to partners substantially older 
than themselves and another system in the west in which at least ten precent of 
people remained unmarried while women married around the age of twenty
three to men who were on average two and a half years older This contrast 
between the two halves of Europe has been much critiqued but a picture 
has emerged which confirms that at least for England and the Netherlands 
marriage ages were and remain high for both men and women However 
the debate around this topic has demonstrated that rather than a strict line of 
division across the continent it might be more accurate to talk of a gradient 
with Central Europe representing an intermediate case where marriage ages 
were lower than in the west but higher than in the east We therefore see 
roughly speaking marriage ages of twentyfour and above often substantially 
so for both men and women in northwestern Europe between twenty and 
twentyfour for women in Central and Southern Europe and under twenty for 
women in many parts of Eastern Europe though the male age at marriage is 
often substantially higher in these regions 
In a period where contraception methods were unreliable and sex outside 
of marriage was frowned upon though premarital sex did occur and 
frequently marriage ages had a direct effect on the number of children women 
bear Relatively close ages of spouses have been linked to a more consensual 
equitable type of relationship Studies of presentday couples show that in 
regions where the age gap between husband and wife is large with husbands 
much older than their brides this leads to more exposure to domestic violence 
less investment in childrens particularly girls schooling and less say in 
important decisions such as the distribution of expenditure on health care
One factor which may explain higher marriage ages in northwestern Europe 
is the fact that couples upon getting married were expected to establish their
