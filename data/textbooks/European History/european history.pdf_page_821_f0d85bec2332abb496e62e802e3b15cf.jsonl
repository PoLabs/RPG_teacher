to wither slowlya process triggered by complex economic and cultural 
conditions More specifically the farming system had since the last third of 
the eighteenth century been transformed Consequently tax was levied on 
individuals rather than on villages and families This made the economic 
community more and more superfluous Alongside this process the zadrugas 
were abolished by law during the last decades of the nineteenth century The 
intention behind this move was to make propriety relations more transparent 
and individualised The results of the resolutions were rather weak
The cohabitation of multiple generations was also dictated by the order of 
succession In addition to the universal order of Roman law the legal folklore 
of inheritance also prevailed In traditional places heirs held to the instructions 
of an oral will as much as those of a written one especially if the former 
was confirmed by local customs In some regions of Hungary inhabited by 
communities accustomed to German legal institutions it was common practice 
for a son usually the oldest to inherit the land herd inheritance while the 
others mastered craftsmanship with the financial support of their father In 
that case the son who had inherited the land stayed together with his family 
and with his parents but his siblings eventually moved out of the household 
In the wake of Napoleons conquests the Code Civil impacted the various legal 
regimes to different degrees In contrast to the earlier regimes the Code Civil 
made inheritance by equal share commonplace in Europe This new practice 
typically among those with less wealth involved the fragmentation of the 
land If there was no possibility of emigration equal inheritance was not only 
economically damaging but also a regular source of strife among the brothers 
Another option was a practice documented from the end of the eighteenth 
century wherein one of the married sons or daughters with her spouse to 
support her entered into a contract with their parents to inherit the parental 
wealth Other siblings would receive a small amount of compensation but 
they were exempt from the burden of parenting
Industrialisation and Families
One of the main drivers of the historical change in lifecycles generational 
relations and family structures was industrialisation which went handin
hand with urbanisation Growing cities with lively industrial and service 
sectors drew in more and more Europeans from rural areas In Germany for 
example sixtyfour percent of people lived in communities with less than 2000 
inhabitants in 1871 By 1910 this number had decreased to about forty percent 
In that time the number of German cities with more than 100000 inhabitants 
increased from eight accounting for five percent of the overall population 
to fortyeight cities accounting for twentyone percent Living in urban areas
