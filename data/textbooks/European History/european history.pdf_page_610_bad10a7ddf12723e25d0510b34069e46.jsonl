crisis the magnitude of which was comparable to that of the losses during 
the Second World War Some of these countries found some relief by joining 
the European Union created from European Economic Community in 1993 
since this offered the new members access to resources in the form of direct 
investments and modern technologies At the same time the opening of non

Conclusion
Looking at the roles of entrepreneurs companies and markets in the long

these countries 
Having said that both socialist and capitalist economies struggled with
