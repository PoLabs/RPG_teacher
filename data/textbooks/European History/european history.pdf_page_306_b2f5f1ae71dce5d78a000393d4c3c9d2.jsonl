These parallel maps reveal the transformation of European empires 
before and after the First World War Most prominent changes include the 
dissolution of AustriaHungary into the nationstates of Austria Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia the conglomeration of Serbia Montenegro and other lands of 
the former AustriaHungary into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the creation 
of Poland Lithuania Latvia Estonia and Finland out of territories previously 
controlled by the Russian empire
The NationState Minorities Diaspora 
In many ways the nationstate was an invention of the long nineteenth century 
The various national movements of that period rapidly turned this novel idea 
into mainstream political reality As a result by the start of the twentieth 
century the notion that every nationevery peoplewas entitled to its own 
politically autonomous geographical territory had become the main driving 
force of politics Nationalists who argued that their nations had experienced 
longrunning minority status in various imperial settings reinforced their 
demands for their own nationstates While neither nations nor states were 
new the nationstate was an innovation on the model of the multinational 
kingdoms and empires that had dominated the map of Europe for centuries 
In order to understand how this political makeup shifted in the twentieth 
century it is important to consider the nationstate as a third entity formed 
from the state a political unit and nation a social group that understands 
itself as an actual or potential sovereign community Except for ethnically 
diverse states without aspirations for monoethnicity such as France Spain 
the United Kingdom and Belgium many of the newer European nation
states in the twentieth century had one crucial defining feature they strove 
to be ethnically homogeneous In theoretical terms every nationstate was to be 
inhabited by the members of only one ethnic nation
Realities were different As the century commenced much of Europe still 
consisted of empires The Habsburg Empire the German Empire and the 
Russian Empire controlled much of the continent On the edge of Europe the 
crumbling Ottoman Empire still exerted influence especially in the Balkans 
Ireland was part of Great Britain All in all therefore most political units in 
Europe were multiethnic in 1900 Nevertheless these multinational empires 
were under constant pressure until they finally collapsed in the wake of the 
First World War For many 1918 marked a moment of muchneeded change 
a clean state on which Europe could be remade to fit ethnopolitical desires 
American President Woodrow Wilson 18561924 popularised the ideal of 
national selfdetermination amongst various ethnic groups that now saw an 
opportunity to demand statehood
