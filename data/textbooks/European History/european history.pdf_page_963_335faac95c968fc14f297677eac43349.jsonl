twentyfirst century developments they build on changing paradigms from 
the late twentieth century
Urban Heritage 
In the first half of the twentieth century the European history of urban heritage 
followed the nineteenthcentury pattern of the identification of historic urban 
quarters towns and centres and the protection of urban monuments Initially 
up to the 1970s cultural heritage was primarily used to provide a solid basis 
for differentbut primarily nationallevels of identitybuilding endeavours 
by mobilising both professionals and amateurs through protection projects 
During this long process historic centrestowns were defined and protected 
all over Europe
From the perspective of the evolution of urban heritage two major shifts 
can be identified The first major shift saw the globalisation of the concept of 
cultural heritage as the common culture of humanity through institutions 
such as UNESCO In the second half of the twentieth century the designation

heritage as both a global and local reference point for identity building also 
required a flexible concept which could extend beyond definitions based on 
the distinction between cultural and natural heritage as standardised by the 
World Heritage Convention This holistic approach to cultural heritage sought

previous heritage interpretations In the case of urban heritage this conceptually 
expanding renewal leads to the concept of the heritage city according to 
which the city reflects the current holistic concept of heritage uniting tangible 
intangible and natural aspects and is managed by its community 
The global importance of European urban heritage is indicated by the fact 
that the three most important standardsetting instruments were formulated 
in European cities and these played different roles according to the evolution 
of this notion of urban heritage The international regulation of urban
