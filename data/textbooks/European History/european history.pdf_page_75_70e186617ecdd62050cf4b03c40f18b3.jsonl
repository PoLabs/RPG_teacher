the United Kingdom became EC members the Mediterranean enlargements 
which added Greece in 1981 and Portugal and Spain in 1986 marking an 
important milestone in these countries transition from dictatorship to 
democracy the accession of Austria Finland and Swedenall countries that 
had pursued a policy of neutrality during the Cold Warto the renamed and 
restructured European Union created by the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 and 
the long complex eastern enlargement that brought in ten new members in 
2004 Czech Republic Hungary Poland Slovakia Slovenia Lithuania Latvia 
Estonia Malta and Cyprus followed by three more in 2007 Bulgaria and 
Romania and 2013 Croatia
These changes have not only altered the location of the EUs external borders 
to the north south and east but also affected how its internal borders work A 
milestone in this regard was the signing in 1985 of the Schengen Agreement 
which aimed to abolish checks at shared borders and to create a single external 
border The agreements implementation was delayed repeatedly not least 
because of Western European fears after 1989 that the EUs parallel eastern 
enlargement would lead to mass immigration The Schengen Agreement 
entered into force between some countries in 1995 gradually expanding to 
encompass most but not all EU states and some nonEU members Norway 
and Switzerland today promising the free movement of some 400 million 
people within the Schengen Area This represents a huge shift compared to 
the hard borders and divisions that characterised long stretches of European 
geopolitical history especially duringbut also prior tothe Cold War 
The process of EU integration and the signing of the Schengen Agreement 
have undeniably reduced barriers to individual mobility and trade between 
European states but the practice has not always lived up to the loftier promises 
and expectations of open borders EU states have repeatedly suspended 
Schengen and reintroduced temporary border controls This has usually taken 
place briefly in advance of international summits or in response to terrorism 
and sometimes for extended periods In 2015 many European states closed 
their borders to refugees seeking asylum from civil wars in Northern Africa 
and the Middle East and renewed these temporary restrictions for years 
thereafter Tellingly in 2020 the first reaction to the Covid19 pandemic in 
much of the EU was to close borders effectively shutting down free movement 
in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus And while many Europeans 
are by now accustomed to roaming freely throughout the continent non
Europeansincluding trading partners and the citizens of former colonies of 
past empires of European nationshave faced increasing restrictions on their 
mobility into and within Europe European borders have become very open to 
some people and very closed to others with checks exercised across wide zones 
rather than only at border crossings To many observers the Nobel Peace Prize
