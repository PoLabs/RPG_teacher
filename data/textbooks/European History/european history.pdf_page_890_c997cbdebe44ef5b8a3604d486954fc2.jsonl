The Transformation of News
Communication increased in volume and accelerated in speed At the beginning 
of the century the rapid transmission of news and messages was achieved by 
networks of special couriers and carrier pigeons The speed of transmission 
exponentially increased with the development of the electric telegraph in use 
from 1845 onwards Whereas the news of the victory of Austerlitz in 1805 had 
taken ten days to reach Paris it took no more than two hours for a speech by 
Napoleon III to be known in Algiers in 1858 From 1851 a cable linked Calais 
to Dover and by 1866 a cable connected both sides of the Atlantic 
News was relayed by news agencies the first of which was founded in 1835 
in Paris by CharlesLouis Havas Two employees of his Agence Havas now 
Agence FrancePresse AFP started their own agency Germanborn Paul 
Julius Reuter founded Reuters first in Aachen and then relocated to London 
while his compatriot Bernard Wolff founded Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau 
In 1865 these three formed a news cartel somewhat grandiosely called the 
Grande Alliance in which they divided up Europe amongst themselves and 
agreed to share and monopolise news on the continent 
The laying of submarine cables and the invention of text transcribers made 
the electric telegraph the essential instrument for transmitting news All major 
European newspapers were equipped with it and the telegraph contributed 
to structuring centres and peripheries within countries These were linked by 
wire to the capital Later newspapers were among the first to subscribe to the 
telephone Using all technological improvements to deliver information before 
other newspapers became the central aim making speed a key element in the 
competition between news media 
The railway allowed reporters to travel faster and also increased the 
circulation of newspapers and other journals This generated new audiences 
and helped to forge national identities rooted in nationallyoriented news 
and collective debate These national identities sometimes corresponded to 
state boundaries while in other cases they did not In Bohemia for example 
which was under AustroHungarian control several daily newspapers were 
published in Czech in the 1860s as Nrodn Listy and Pokrok In 1890 there 
were 418 periodicals available in Bohemia 253 of which were in Czech a 
testament to the relative freedom enjoyed by the various nationalities in the 
AustroHungarian Empire 
In Italy nationallyoriented newspapers such as La Nazione founded in 
Florence 1855 preceded Italian political unification More generally the 
countries that were unified at an early stage had a press that was more centred 
on their capitals Paris Copenhagen Madrid while ununified countries 
such as Germany and Italy were distinguished by a more fragmented 
communication and information structure
