Erasmus students should be increased the number of courses in English needs 
to be increased But as the Dutch Association of Universities VSNU remarked 
in 2018 internationalisation not only means English teaching material but also 
the integration of crossborder issues intercultural skills and diverse cultural 
perspectives in the curriculum Until now Englishlanguage textbooks about 
European history were often written from the implicit or explicit national 
perspective of their anglophone principally British or American authors A 
truly international curriculum as the intended result of an internationalisation 
of history education at institutions of higher education needs to reflect the 
complex and transnational nature of European history in both content and 
structure The aim must be to balance linguistic internationalisation in the 
form of English instruction with a truly European approach to the content 
taught We hope that this handbook will contribute to this undertaking
Our author teams are sourced from seventeen universities in the Czech 
Republic France Germany Hungary the Netherlands Norway the United 
Kingdom and Spain Our vision was that each chapter would be written by 
an international team of authors from at least three of these countries We did 
not always succeed in fulfilling these aims While the majority of the chapters 
were written as planned by groups of three or four authors based at different 
European universities this proved impossible for some chapters either because 
of a lack of expertise in our team this was the case for early modern history 
or because historical events affected our project of writing history for the 
most part this handbook was produced during a global pandemic successive 
lockdowns and under the threat of serious illness which took a toll on our 
authors their families and the project itself People fell ill or were required 
to care for sick relatives and could not contribute as they had intended We 
had elaborate plans for international project meetings and writing retreats in 
which authors would dedicate themselves to writing multiperspective takes 
on European history Instead we discussed plans in lengthy online meetings 
wrote and edited from our home offices while nursing crying children 
struggling with isolation and loneliness or recovering from serious illness
While this partly derailed our plansas happens with even the bestlaid 
onesit did not undermine the purpose of this handbook What we aimed to 
do was to provide examples of doing European history or case studies that 
can be used to teach students what a multiperspective approach to European 
history might look like
This is why this handbook is not structured simply by important events 
in European historyfrom the French Revolution to the fall of the Berlin 
Wallbut by themes that cut across national boundaries and transcend clearly 
demarcated historical trajectories Each chapter shows how the respective topic
