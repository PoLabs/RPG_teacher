The 1970s and 1980s saw the final defeat of the global Marxist renaissance 
in western countries According to leftwing authors such as the Slovenian 
philosopher Slavoj iek the capitalist state appropriated the slogans of the 
New Left but formed them in its own image Since the programme of the welfare 
state was a statedriven project the idea that the state should withdraw 
from education health care and the economy through privatisation placed 
the welfare state under serious pressure Following the lead of the Austrian 
School of economics neoliberals saw capitalism as the most important means

Wallerstein and the Worldsystems School from the 1970s Proponents of 
this theory argued that the core countries the capitalist centre provide the 
peripheries with industrial goods while the periphery serves as a market a 
supplier of raw materials and a source of cheap labour Thus the hierarchical 
relationship between the centre and the periphery is established through 
unequal exchange 
Alongside the decline of the western left the statesocialist countries 
experienced a decline in their economic performance and efficiency Many 
countries such as Poland East Germany and Hungary became heavily 
indebted to the West The tacit compromise with their working classes was no
