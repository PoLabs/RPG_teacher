21 DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE
151
In the long run however the growth of per capita income during the 
nineteenth century undoubtedly had a positive effect on the wellbeing of the 
population In one century the mean income almost tripled Higher personal 
income improved the quality of life as it made better housing nutrition 
and hygiene affordable The wheels of the demographic transition were 
set in motion as households were enabled to reach a desirable standard of 
living improving their own survival chances and those of their offspring 
Simultaneously the income of governments and public authorities grew 
allowing administrations to provide muchneeded improvements in public 
hygiene by investing in sewerage and water pipes Industrialisation had 
introduced new social and health problems but it also presented the economic 
means to solve them
However the demographic transition cannot be explained by the growth 
of bustling industrial cities alone Slower longer less visible and equally 
important was the revolution in agriculture that started in the eighteenth 
century Rapidly growing populations were fed by agricultural innovations 
as crop rotation replaced the medieval openfield and threefield systems 
new plants such as potatoes and corn were produced modern machines like 
seed drills and threshing machines were invented and artificial fertilisers 
made more land fertile Simultaneously steamships and railways introduced 
a transport revolution which enabled Europeans to cheaply import food from 
overseas especially in the last three decades of the nineteenth century Finally 
there were also rapid medical innovations in the second half of the nineteenth 
century such as the discovery of bacteria and parasites and the development 
of preventive healthcare Combined with economic growth these factors 
allowed for rapid demographic change in the nineteenth century 
Conclusion
The nineteenth century can be characterised as a century of revolutionary 
demographic change States started to actively manage their populations 
mortality and fertility decreased and living standards started to improve The 
changing role of states the demographic transition and improving quality of 
life were surprisingly similar across Europe But this transformative process 
was still ongoing and despite similar trends between countries there were 
many local differences It took until the twentieth century before mortality and 
fertility rates reached similar levels again 
Even though twenty to fourty percent of all children died before their fifth 
birthday at the beginning of the nineteenth century most intellectuals were 
afraid of population growth as something that could only lead to hunger
