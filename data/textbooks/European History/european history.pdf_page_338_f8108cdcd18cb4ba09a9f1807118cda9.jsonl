UNIT 3 POWER AND CITIZENSHIP
318
However by the end of the twentieth century there were only a few remnants 
of these onceglobal empires The steady decline of colonial power and its 
ultimate disintegration is perhaps one of the most significant trends in the 
global history of the twentieth century Yet even with the decline of direct 
colonial rule there are still many imperial remnants around the world that 
to this day influence the development and internal affairs of postcolonial 
countries 
Contiguous Empires in Eastern Europe
While colonialism is often considered a phenomenon associated with Western 
Europe the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe had their own experience 
with empires too Until 1918 most territories of Central Eastern Europe were 
a part of one of four empires German AustroHungarian Russian and 
Ottoman 
Despite the demise of those empires after the Great War imperial dreams 
remained Germany and Hungary set themselves on a path of revisionism 
seeking to reclaim their lost territories and briefly reinstituting their rule 
during the Second World War In particular Germany under Nazi rule 
had an ambitious imperial vision of vast East European spaces subjugated 
to and colonised by German settlers Soviet Russia also sought the lands it 
had lost to newly emerging countries after the First World War and tried to 
retake them in 1939 and then again successfully in 19441945 But even the 
new countries built in 1918 on an antiimperial narrative were not entirely 
immune to imperial temptations There were voices in both Czechoslovakia 
and Poland that asked for certain former German colonies the possession of 
which was supposed to secure to those countries a place among the Western 
European powers Moreover policies which dealt with minority populations 
and peripheral territories in the new countries were often not so different from 
those of the old empires sometimes creating the impression that the empires 
did not leave but were only reconfigured The Balkan Peninsula became a 
fault zone for several imperial visions Almost every country in the region 
followed the path of border revisionism and sought to enlarge its territory 
During the 1930s most of the Balkan Peninsula also turned to different forms 
of dictatorship which were more willing to use force to fulfil their ambitions
In the postwar era the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union officially 
denounced colonialism and support for the anticolonial national liberation 
movements became a crucial part of socialist ideology and practice The 
dichotomies of the Cold War turned anticolonialism into a powerful weapon 
in international relations which the socialist countries used against the 
former colonial powers Drawing parallels between imperialism and fascism
