24 INEQUALITIES
239
Conclusion
Looking at inequalities across the early modern period a number of prominent 
developments can be discerned Profound social changes associated with the 
rise of capitalism threw the inequality of social status that lay at the centre of 
ancien rgime society into doubt As we now know capitalism is compatible with 
profound income inequalities but its rise across the early modern period added 
a novel level of abstraction to social relations disrupting the inequality of rank 
that is central to all hierarchical societies Early modern European expansion 
made possible both the invention of white supremacy by the eighteenth century 
but also the vindication of universal human rights independent of culture sex 
or race While we live in a world of profound inequalities especially income 
inequality the basis of that inequality is fundamentally different from the 
early modern world bound up as it is with ideas of social utility and merit 
rather than the privileges of noble birth Studying equalities and inequalities 
in the early modern period remains valuable because this was a period during 
which deeply entrenched inequalities came to be questioned Understanding 
why this was so can help us to better grapple with the social and political 
tensions that follow from the profound and rising inequality of our own time
