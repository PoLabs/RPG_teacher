These changes in the liberal outlook were accompanied by an intellectual 
reorientation From the midcentury onwards liberalism evolved towards 
a confluence with new scientific theories receiving a new conservative 
twist The positivism of Auguste Comte 17981857 looked for a scientific 
solution to political and social problems modelled on the natural sciences He 
abandoned any idea of individualism revolution or democracy and opted 
for the famous slogan Order and Progress The idea of progress a central 
concept of Enlightenment liberalism the faith that humanity was advancing 
in infinite perfectibility was now restrained by the conservative idea of 
social order pitted against the new workers movements In Britain through 
Herbert Spencer 18201903 positivism took the form of evolutionism in the 
light of Charles Darwins new discoveries It soon became Social Darwinism 
based on alleged biological arguments the evolution of mankind was now

the survival of the fittest Social Darwinism therefore justified inequalities

would disrupt what was seen as a natural evolutionary process based on 
competition for resources and the survival of the fittest
The new findesicle liberalism then abandoned the premise of natural 
human rights to embrace the new Darwinism In opposition to the Marxist idea

imperialism The liberal utopia of peaceful commercial societies increasingly 
interconnected and perpetually progressing many liberals in the first half of 
the century even advocated projects of European unification eventually turned 
into the dystopia of colonial exploitation nationalist clashes and militarisation 
If liberalism was a revolutionary force in the face of monarchical absolutism it 
later became a reactive current against the push for democracy and workers

ideologies that shaped the political and intellectual life on the continent Their 
common denominator was a new idea of society as something that could and 
should be planned and shaped along rational principles The political social

the twentieth century the intellectual landscape of Europe was thoroughly
