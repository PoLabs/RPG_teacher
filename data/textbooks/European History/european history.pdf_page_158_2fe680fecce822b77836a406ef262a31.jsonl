fewer children However with largescale change in farming practices and 
other market developments the demand for female labour subsided and so 
from around 1600 to 1800 women married slightly younger populations grew 
more rapidly and living standards as measured by real wages declined
Between 1000 and 1824 Spain Britain and Poland had steadily growing 
population levels over the early modern period with substantial increases 
emerging in the eighteenth century The population of Britain really took 
off in the eighteenth century reflecting a significant increase in birth rates 
around this time Poland also experienced a change in the rate of population 
growth and across the board this trend was one of acceleration This was a 
time during which the continent stood at the cusp of significant demographic 
changes and it is here that we start to see the first signs of the demographic 
transition to come
In studies of the demographic transition France is a famous outlier There 
birth rates and death rates fell in sync with each other leading to a far smaller 
youth bulge than one would normally expect to see This pattern can already 
be clearly observed over the course of the eighteenth century when French 
birth rates decline precipitously while those in England and Wales rise One 
argument that has been put forward for the very distinct French pattern of 
demographic development is an early process of secularisation which lowered 
expectations around producing large families in service of faith This brings us 
to the next section where fertility is discussed in more detail
Fertility 
Fertility was high in the premodern context In the absence of modern 
contraception childbirth occurred frequentlyand in the absence of modern 
medicine many women died giving birth However there are indications that 
early modern Europeans especially those in the west of the continent did 
not bear as many children as they could have The fact that many women 
from northwestern Europe only married at the age of twentyfive and above 
already limited fertility The practice of extending the breastfeeding stage and a 
preference for greater spacing between children limited the number of children 
born in wedlock Fertility stood between 45 to seven children per woman 
for much of the early modern period Given high levels of infant mortality 
this level of childbirth might well have left couples with only two to three 
adult children a figure at or just above the replacement level for a population 
However certainly for the British case the end of the early modern period 
is one of increasing fertility for France however the opposite occurred and 
women went from having approximately 45 children to having 35 children 
between 1650 and 1800 As discussed above the French case was exceptional
