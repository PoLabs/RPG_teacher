the participation of the Church in Francos government and therefore in its 
repressive policies 
This process of collaboration crystallised in the 1950s with the arrival of 
prominent politicians from the ranks of Opus Dei who pushed the dictatorship 
towards openness and international acceptance However this decade was 
also when the dynamics began to change The Second Vatican Council meant 
for Spanish Catholicism a new look at the modern world and freedoms in 
issues such as liturgy parish government the role of the faithful in the 
Church and in society as well as demands for dialogue and recognition and 
tolerance towards other forms of militancy This was closely connected with 
the ideological process of Liberation Theology with a growing transfer of 
Catholics towards militancy and political commitment to the left or at least 
to democratic proposals In addition there was a clear influence in the 1960s 
of Marxist doctrine in the Catholic and workers ranks The dictatorship 
tried to curb this tendency with some concessions and on the other hand 
support of the most conservative sectors of the ecclesiastical hierarchy This 
led to an absolute rupture in the Spanish Church during the 1960s between 
two different ways of understanding the churchstate relationship a conciliar 
Church critical of Francoism and open to democratic and socialising options 
and an anticonciliar Church that validated Francos Spanish Catholic model 
The arrival of Pope Paul VI 18971978 at the Vatican consolidated this gap 
since his figure was key in the rupture of the Spanish Church with the Franco 
regime in the 1970s Bishops were renamed and figures of the hierarchy 
strongly identified with Francoism were removed The role of the Church 
in an increasingly secularised Spanish society was set in motion This was 
accompanied by the increased militancy of Catholics and priests in dissident 
movements against Francoism the creation of clandestine Catholic political 
parties and the affiliation of many of the faithful to progressive and leftwing 
labour unions 
This rupture connects the Spanish Church of the 1960s and 1970s with the 
international dynamics of a postconciliar European Catholicism dominated 
by a tendency towards secularisation the adoption of concepts and methods 
of Marxist analysis the crisis of faith and Christian and ecclesial identity and 
disaffection towards the Church as an institution This process eventually led 
Spanish Catholicism to play a decisive role in the transition to democracy 
after 1975 and to participate in the signing of a constitution recognising the 
existence of a secular state By the 1980s these changes allowed Spain to have 
a legal framework that regulated the life of an increasingly secularised society 
with a growing rate of civil marriages and divorces a decline of the faithful 
and openness to incorporate into its legality social advances such as marriage 
equality approved in 2005 which made Spain the third country in the world 
to guarantee this right to its citizens
