convened the Congress of Peace in Geneva in 1867 to find a solution to rising 
tensions between the second French Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia over 
the territory of Luxembourg Lemonnier underscored in his appeal to the 
delegates at the congress that a united Europe had to be a free and democratic 
continent in short a Europe fundamentally different from the dynastic 
realities of the time The Congress of Peace in Geneva did not only call for the 
United States of Europe as an abstract utopia but also outlined the conviction 
of many participants that individual freedom and democracy were necessary 
preconditions for a stable peaceful and united Europe
Over the course of the nineteenth century industrial workers and 
subsequently the labour movement emerged as new political subjects The 
European labour movement was initially a very heterogeneous grouping 
of different ideological and political streams In 1848 attempting to unify 
these diverging currents the German philosophers Karl Marx 18181883 
and Friedrich Engels 18201895 published The Manifesto of the Communist 
Party which relied heavily on a negative vision of Europe In its opening 
paragraph the pamphlet depicted the old Europe as a religiouslybased 
alliance sharing a common agenda to fight the imminent rise of communism 
Conjuring up the existence of powerful anticommunist forces in Europe was 
an important strategy to lend credibility to their slogan working men of all 
countries unite Individuals unions and political parties within the labour 
movement subsequently developed an array of positive visions for a united 
Europe During the 1848 revolutions Marx called for a democratic German 
federation as a necessary precondition for a federation of free European states 
Just a few months later Engels attacked liberal designs of European unity and 
eternal peace as mere dreams He stressed that a real European brotherhood

and bloody fights The International Workingmens Association also called 
First International founded in London in 1864 with the aim of improving 
the international standing and networking of industrial workers envisioned 
a united Europe too At its 1867 Lausanne Congress the First International 
underscored two connected core objectives first the transformation of the 
social and political bases of society and second the creation of a federation of 
free European states These developments had further goals first the liberation 
of workers from having to sell their labour to those owning the means of 
production second an increased sense of solidarity and brotherhood among 
workers and finally the aim of augmenting peace and prosperity for workers 
and their families in Europe and around the world by means of eradicating 
capitalist modes of production in favour of a socialist and eventually even 
communist society
The disciples of SaintSimon founded the utopiansocialist school of Saint
Simonianism and published many European union projects during the 1830s
