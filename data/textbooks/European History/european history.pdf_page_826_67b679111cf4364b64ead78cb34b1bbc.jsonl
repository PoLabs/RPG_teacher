UNIT 6 LIVING WITH DIFFERENCE
806
the transformation of family structures was the transformation of European 
economies through industrialisation By displacing populations and redefining 
occupations industrialisation profoundly reshaped social roles within 
families At the same time European elites developed a new family model 
which gradually spread to the middle classes Centred around the nuclear 
family this model ascribed a new importance to childhood which was placed 
at the centre of attention It was only in the twentieth century that this model 
gradually spread to all strata of European society
