17761789 An Atlantic Revolution
The American Revolution 17761783 was a powerful matrix for the emergence 
of European revolutionary movements during the 1780s It was on the one 
hand a triumphant example of a war for national independence on the other 
hand it represented the success of a major political transformation based on 
Enlightenment ideasliberty sovereignty of the people property democracy 
and the republican ideal a political system that contemporaries had so far 
believed to work only in citystates or very small countries 
The influence of the American Revolution was such that in 1955 in the 
context of the Cold War two nonMarxist historians the American Robert 
Palmer and the Frenchman Jacques Godechot elaborated the concept of an 
Atlantic Revolution to link the different revolutionary movements that broke 
out in America and Europe between 1776 and the 1820s From the moment 
it was formulated however the Atlantic Revolution was contested by other 
historians who were critical of a US takeover of European history In their 
view the concept presupposed a centreperiphery framework negated the 
power of the French Revolution in European transformations and obscured 
the national contexts that made each European revolution different Recent 
historiography allows a more nuanced vision that does not entirely disqualify 
either of these two conflicting approaches
Two types of revolutionary movement broke out in Europe in the 1780s 
those chiefly directed against the occupation of a ruler from abroad Ireland and 
Belgium and those directed against political domination by local oligarchies 
Geneva and the Netherlands In several cities of the Helvetic Confederation 
particularly in the Frenchspeaking and Calvinist city of Geneva well
established and widely held democratic demands began to challenge the 
existing oligarchic order from the end of the 1770s The NativesGenevans 
born of foreign parentsand the inhabitants of the rural hinterlands wanted to 
obtain the right of citizenship while the Genevan bourgeoisie wanted to open 
up the municipal power held only by a few rich patrician families Despite its 
resistance the municipal oligarchy was overthrown on the revolutionary day 
of 8 April 1782 But by July this Genevan Revolution was already crushed by 
the military intervention of neighbouring powersthe kingdoms of France 
and Piedmont and the cantons of Zurich and Bernat the request of the 
oligarchs
The traditional political conflict in the Republic of the United Provinces of 
the Netherlands inherited from the seventeenth century pitted the Orange 
Party of the stadhouder the head of the fleet and army against the republican 
States Party composed of the socalled regents regententhe bourgeois 
and Calvinist oligarchy of the large merchant cities who held municipal and 
provincial power in the autonomous provinces This conflict was revived
