resounding theoretical echo what happens if the prince fails in his Christian 
duties In the context of the Wars of Religion 15621598 conflicts in France 
between Protestants and Roman Catholics this question arose repeatedly 
especially among Calvins followers in the aftermath of the St Bartholomews 
Day massacres in 1572 The Monarchomachs then affirmed more categorically 
the duty of disobedient subjects caught in the clutches of a tyrannical power 
At the end of the sixteenth century political thought therefore shifted 
significantly towards constitutional thinking Princely virtue was no longer 
sufficient to guarantee a happy republic it had to adopt clearer legal contours 
defining the power of the sovereign in his political relationship with the 
confessional society The ideal of a regime by assemblies defended by the 
Monarchomachs gained momentum The Catholic nobility also made it their 
credo supported by neoThomists such as Pedro de Ribadeneyra 15271611 
Treatise on the Religion and Virtues That a Christian Prince Should Have 1595 or 
Juan de Mariana 15361624 De rege et regis institutione 1599 This political 
ideal was however opposed by jurists such as Jean Bodin 15301596 
who in The Six Books of the Republic 1576 provides a universal definition of 
sovereignty as a monopoly of the law 
Now those who are sovereign must not be subject to the commands of others and must be 
able to give law to their subjects and to break or destroy useless laws in order to make others 
This cannot be done by those who are subject to the laws or to those who have authority 
over them That is why the law says that the prince is absolved from the power of the laws
New Conceptions of Freedom
In the seventeenth century the political effects of the confessionalisation of 
society during the previous century became clear A neoRoman conception 
of civil liberty was forged at this time which influenced the first English 
Revolution 16401660 One of the most important intellectuals of the first 
English Revolution was John Milton 16081674 An expert on the works of 
antiquity Milton took up the arguments of his predecessors in The Tenure of 
Kings and Magistrates 1649 according to which the right of resistance is a duty 
when the king goes against the interests of the governed Beyond that he gives 
an original interpretation of freedom based on the biblical idea that truth is 
gradually revealed to men and that consequently tyrants remain in error 
If John Milton was still inspired by the Gospels many European 
intellectuals of this period freed the field of political activities from the idea 
of divine intervention In 1612 the Spanish philosopher Francisco Surez 
15481617 argued in his Tractatus de legibus ac de Deo legislatore No king 
no monarch has or has had the political principate immediately from God or 
by the act of a divine institution but by means of human will or institution
