35 PROTEST AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS
419
While protest emerged in each country during the 1950s for different 
reasons by the 1960s protest potential was present everywhere This decade 
was marked by a general qualitative upsurge of student unrest this time 
coupled with workers movements that were previously dormant In Spain a 
strong trade unionist movement was becoming visible by the early 1960s with 
the semilegal and Communistcontrolled Comisiones Obreras initiating several 
major incidents of organised opposition such as massive strikes in Asturias 
in 1962 Greek and Portuguese statecontrolled trade unions were unwilling 
to organise strikes despite occasional outbursts A major exception occurred 
in July 1965 in Athens when a wave of workers strikes and demonstrations 
against the direct involvement of the crown in Greeces politics paralysed the 
country
The mid to late 1960s marked the beginning of a protest wave The apparent 
softening of censorship in Spain Portugal and Greece provided a space for 
action and allowed for the import of political and artistic stimuli from France 
Italy and West Germany At the same time the upheavals of 1956 and 
especially 1968 created major rifts within leftwing organisations leading to 
the gradual emergence of a New Left and from the early 1970s onwards 
a Eurocommunist contingent Other forms of leftwing politics were also on 
the rise Maoists and Trotskyists immersed themselves in new radicalism 
inspired by Mao Zedong Ho Chi Minh Fidel Castro and Che Guevara They 
sought mobilisation at all costs importing the tiersmondiste frame of guerrilla 
movements from Africa Asia and Latin America Fantasies of anticolonial 
and antiimperialist violence proliferated in this framework wherein local 
authoritarianism was often seen through the prism of US neocolonialism 
In fact the Basque separatist organisation ETA framed the Basque country 
as the European Cuba and intellectuals such as JeanPaul Sartre famously 
supported this idea 
State response to agitation was so brutal that it resembled the Eastern 
European or Latin American model of protest policing This was the case with 
the 1968 occupations of the Universities of Madrid and Barcelona along with 
occupations of the Law School and Polytechnic School in Athens in February 
and November 1973 respectively with the latter ending up in a bloody 
intervention by the regime 
Despite some breakthroughs in terms of gender and sexuality within the 
movements the absence of strong feminist homosexual or ecologist demands 
is striking These socalled new social movements only flourished in the post
authoritarian European South after the fall of the regimes in the mid to late 
1970s In a sense from the mid1970s up to the early 1980s protest movements 
in these countries were synchronised with and increasingly resembled their 
counterparts in Western Europe
