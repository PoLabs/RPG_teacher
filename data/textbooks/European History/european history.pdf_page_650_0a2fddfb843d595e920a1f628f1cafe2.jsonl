peasants The former were more involved in urban life and commerce while 
the latter often preferred to invest in land when they had accumulated some 
savings The peasantry finally entered the early modern empire of things 
albeit slowly and hesitatingly In England by contrast the opportunities for 
commercial farming and rural industry meant that consumer practices spread 
more quickly among the rural classes than in France especially among the 
yeomanry and wealthier husbandmen and in the Low Countries high levels 
of urbanisation meant that for contemporary commentators the Dutch were 
in the vanguard of consumerism But from Scandinavia to Iberia to Eastern 
Europe variations in social structure and the distribution of wealth inevitably 
affected the timing nature and extent of consumption
Having introduced these key questions and concerns the next section 
turns to the more specific issue of increases in both the quantity and quality of 
goods produced in early modern Europe The chapter concludes by outlining 
the set of interconnected factors which along with transformations in craft 
and manufacture made the development of consumer societies possible 
commercialisation globalisation urbanisation and the adoption of consumer 
practices
Development in Production
Between roughly 1400 and 1800 European industrial producers achieved 
a small miracle Many of their products became increasingly sophisticated 
while at the same time the prices of those products were decreasing steadily 
As a result of these two developments many industrial products that were 
only accessible to the richest class of people in 1400 were available to ordinary 
people by 1800 Moreover these cheap populuxe goods of the eighteenth 
century were often of a higher quality than their very expensive predecessors 
from the Middle Ages 
One example is clocks and watches Mechanical instruments to keep time 
emerged in the Middle Ages probably in the German lands but the Italians 
also stake a claim to their invention In the beginning clocks were big and 
expensive but by 1800 they had become small and affordable The centre 
of watchmaking shifted from France to England and to the western parts 
of Switzerland The clock and watchmakers were sometimes organised in 
special guilds the first of which emerged in the sixteenth century while in 
other locations they were members of a general metalworkers guild The first 
clockmakers were migrant workers moving from one church to another By 
the time the watch came around it developed into an urban industry However 
the eighteenthcentury watch industry moved back to the countryside in the 
Swiss Jura
