against Russia due to their differing perspectives on the future of the Ottoman 
Empire 
Even though the Middle East was never colonised each of the major 
European empires still managed to establish dominance in certain parts of 
the region They exerted control over the Ottoman and Persian economies 
by signing free trade agreements with the local authorities during politically 
turbulent times for these Middle Eastern empires Local monopolies were 
abolished and customs tariffs for European exports and imports were lowered 
much to the benefit of the western metropoles
Despite all these stark differences between the Middle Eastern and African 
experiences of European imperialism a particular form of discursive practice 
ran through the nineteenth century European direct control or dominant 
influence in Africa and the Middle East was justified time and time again 
when European colonialism and hegemony in Africa and the Middle East cast 
it as a duty on the part of the civilised European nations the duty of civilising 
the rest educating them and thus rendering them happier wiser better 
to cite the British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston Both the African and 
Middle Eastern peoples came to be seen through an imperial and imperialist 
hubris which homogenised them into an un or semicivilised other prone to 
barbarism and violence 
Conclusion
China the Ottoman Empire and Persia were thus opened up by Europeans to 
the circuits of global free trade which continued over decades to impoverish 
local economies Local resistance movements and anticolonial rebellions 
such as the Boxer War came to be associated in Western parlance with eastern 
barbarity Islamic fanaticism or the yellow peril Yet rarely if ever were 
the economic and psychological undertones of violence or the European 
triggers of rebellion and civil war taken into account Political instability in 
the rest of the world supplied the powers with enough pretext for further 
intervention expansionism or the establishment of direct control as outlined 
in the introduction to this chapter But these manoeuvres only hardened local 
sentiments and politics resulting in ideological backlashes as antiliberalism 
gained traction in the nonEuropean world as an offshoot of the nineteenth
century experience Only Japan and the United States made their way into the 
privileged rank of great powers with their own imperial expansionism in the 
name of civilisation at the end of the nineteenth century It was at this point 
that the context for a new international order was set But it would take two 
disastrous and unprecedented World Wars for this new order to finally take 
shape
