Introduction
In the nineteenth century the manifestation of European influence and power 
and the worldwide presence of Europeans were expressed in dramatic histories 
of migration From the end of the eighteenth century Europeans were on the 
move on an increasing scale and this movement had a profound impact on the 
European continent and the world at large 
This increase in the mobility of Europeans took place first of all within 
Europe itself Older accounts of the nineteenth century focused on urbanisation 
understood as a unidirectional movement from the countryside to the cities 
In fact internal European migration was a rather complicated backandforth 
movement of people between town and countryside on the tide of a seasonal 
and conjunctural labour market and the pulse of international conquest and 
conflict An increasing number of people enabled by improved highways and 
waterways andespeciallythe fast expansion of the railway were able not 
just to leave their home but also to travel back to places which they had never 
completely leftplaces with which they had remained in touch anyway due 
to the expansion of the telegraph and the spectacular growth of the press 
The same can be said for the upturn in migration beyond Europe even 
at this greater distance facilitated by the construction of large and fast 
steel steam ships migration was only partly a definitive emigration Just as 
Europeans moved around within Europe their global trajectory of migration 
was often more circular than linear Even if European migrants settled 
permanently elsewhere they remained in close contact with their homeland 
a term that itself captures the nostalgic way that the territory of departure 
came to be viewed Additionally increasingly invasive imperial rule by the 
British French German Dutch and Belgians subjected people beyond Europe
