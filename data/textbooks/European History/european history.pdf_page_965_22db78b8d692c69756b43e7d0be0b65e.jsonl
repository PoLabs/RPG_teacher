74 HERITAGE AND MEMORY

many regime changes such as those that oversaw the installation of socialist 
regimes in Eastern Europe led to the imposition of ideologically motivated 
masternarratives in official memory cultures These masternarratives often 
intertwined concepts of historical materialism with the existing heroic story 
of the nation Thus for instance the Hussite Reformation movement of early
fifteenth century Bohemia the Czech national revival of the nineteenth century 
and the ultimate victory of the working class in 1948ie the installation of 
a communist regimewere interwoven in a continuous narrative that affected 
the ways history was disseminated in socialist Czechoslovakia not least in 
popular genres such as historical movies
The twentieth century also witnessed the growth of theoretical reflection 
on how the past has been collectively remembered and the birth of the 
new discipline of Memory Studies As early as the 1920s and 1930s French 
sociologist Maurice Halbwachs theorised the social dimension of collective 
and individual memory Much later in the 1980s another French scholar 
Pierre Nora introduced the concept of lieux de mmoire realms of memory 
an inventory ofand reflection onmany topoi in French collective memory 
an approach that has been replicated in many other national contexts Other 
scholars explored media and mechanisms of cultural memory as a sphere 
of cultural reproduction Collective traumas of twentiethcentury wars 
oppressive regimes and violent atrocities as well as the spectre of their being 
denied or forgotten were additional impulses for Memory Studies namely in 
setting the agenda for how to deal with the difficult past The Second World 
War and the Holocaust were in many ways seminal in this respect
The memory of the Second World War unfolded through several 
phases while also following different trajectories in Western and Eastern 
Europe Official amnesia reinforced by Cold War divisions and a clearcut 
differentiation between perpetrator and victim countries prevailed in the West 
until the 1960s when questions about the past were raised with new urgency 
WestGerman controversies about the unresolved Nazi past were paralleled 
in other countries such as Italy and Austria which strove to integrate periods 
of authoritarian regimes into their national narratives In some of the countries 
that had hitherto styled themselves as victims the memory of the Second 
World War became unsettled by questions about collaboration with Nazism 
and complicity in the persecution of the Jews In France for instance these 
disturbing issues became known as the Vichy Syndrome Henry Rousso 
a strand of thought which argued that the Vichy regime the common name 
of the French government after the countrys military defeat was in fact an 
integral part of a distinct strand of a broader French political and intellectual 
tradition antisemitic conservative as opposed to a mere aberration imposed 
by a German military victory
