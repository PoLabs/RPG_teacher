life as long as they did not openly resist the Nazis and their ideology Some 
secured the continuation of their research activities by cooperating with Nazi 
authorities Others continued to work in silence and ignored abuses by Nazis 
and Nazi collaborators in their milieu In much of Central and Eastern Europe 
Nazis systematically destroyed scientific and research institutions Numerous 
university members were murdered while others fled leaving behind their 
homeland family language and culture
After the end of the Second World War Europes universities schools and 
cultural institutions were mostly reestablished within nationallyoriented 
education and cultural systems Additionally there was also a renewed 
dynamic of internationalisation The revival of internationalism after the end 
of the Second World War was notably expressed in the form of largescale 
research projects that were jointly financed by the governments of several 
countries In Western Europe the European Organisation for Nuclear Research 
CERN was founded in 1952 and the European Space Research Organisation 
ESRO in 1964 These are two of many examples where governments pooled 
their resources in order to jointly develop stature in costly fields of research 
Postwar internationalisation also took on a dynamic that had been almost 
unknown until then after 1945 governments set up plenty of new international 
organisations which fostered European and international policies in the fields of 
education science and culture In Western Europe under the circumstances of 
economic integration and eastwest conflict governments founded a number of 
organisations in which science and education policies were debated including 
the Council of Europe the Western European Union NATO and the OECD 
Thus they established a global infrastructure for international policymaking in 
education culture and science marking a contrast with the period before and 
after the First World War In addition to these governmental organisations 
multilateral cultural and educational initiatives were launched in the process 
of Europes political unification Although these bodies emerged under the 
influence of governments they soon claimed nongovernmental status for 
themselves This is exemplified by the College of Europe in Bruges which was 
established in 1950 as an independent graduate school for areas of emerging 
European integration or by the European Cultural Foundation founded in 
1954 on the initiative of the Swiss philosopher Denis de Rougemont 
After 1945 the socialist countries in Europes east mostly took Soviet 
education as a role model and adapted it in their own ways In general all 
forms and levels of education were stateowned and free of charge The 
uniform elementary education from eight to ten years led into three options 
of secondary education two of which provided an opportunity to apply for 
higher educational options Schools offering vocational education was less 
socially prestigious Russian was taught as the first foreign language all over
