the free circulation of knowledge cherished by scholarly culture While men 
of science received a great part of their status and prestige from publicising 
their discoveries and theories anyone who engaged in the commercialisation 
of technologies strove to keep some of the information secret Or within the 
liberal logic of free trade and industry they appealed to the state to establish 
and protect their right to be financially rewarded for their innovations from 
those who wished to produce them for profit The tension between these two 
opposing cultures of intellectual commons versus property characterised the 
century
Europe was a hub both of highprofile scientific institutions and of industrial 
production in which technology played a key role The continent was also 
the site of several colonial metropolises from which projects of colonial 
conquest and rule were designed and launched turning new technologies 
such as steamships railways and innovative firing arms into instruments 
of European domination in Asia and Africa In some cases most famous 
being that of Egypt and the Suez Canal investment in construction projects 
railways and new military technologies led to the substantial indebtment of 
local rulers and the failure to pay such debts was used to legitimise direct 
or indirect takeover of these countries by European powers Nonetheless it 
would not be accurate to understand Europe purely as a centre from which 
science and technology radiated to the rest of the world For instance the 
prestigious engineering and medical schools of Paris Lige Lausanne Zurich 
and Vienna only remained global centres of knowledge transmission so long 
as elites from the Balkans Latin America or Asia acknowledged them as such 
and continued to send their youth to study there Among those elites we see a 
major change in the reputation of engineering schools towards the end of the 
century with the popularity of Belgian Swiss and German institutions on the 
rise to the detriment of the French schools Moreover many of the greatest 
works of nineteenthcentury engineering were built outside of Europe such 
as the Suez and Panama Canals European and North American experts and 
investors played an essential role in their construction but so did local and 
migrant workers along with local rulers and bureaucrats This constant 
intermingling of efforts was essential to making technology and technology
related professions truly global irreducible to any specific race nationality

Conclusion
The nineteenth century was often perceived by its contemporaries as the 
century of progress If asked why it deserved such a label they would 
most probably list some of the technological wonders that characterised the
