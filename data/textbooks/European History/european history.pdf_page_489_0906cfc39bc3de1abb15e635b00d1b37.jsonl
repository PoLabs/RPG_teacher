42 SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND WELFARE

kings from the fifteenth century onwards often highlighted the obligation of 
the state to develop and institutionalise secular care of people and their health 
English Catholic politician Thomas More 14781535 who served as 
Chancellor of England to Henry VIII in his fictional sociopolitical satire Utopia 
1516 described an ideal society inhabited by rational men contrasted with a 
contemporary Antwerp stricken by mounting social ills In a more explicit way 
the converted Spanish Jew and scholar Juan Luis Vives 14931540 addressed 
the social problem Vives had spent a short spell at the court of the English ruler 
Henry VIII and later became a teacher of a prince and archbishop of Toledo 
William II de Cro In his De subventione pauperum On Assistance to the Poor 
he explicitly called for the state to provide social and financial relief for the 
poor In his eyes neither the Churchof which he was mostly suspicious
nor individual almsgiving could stand up to the new challenges associated 
with urban population growth in places such as Bruges the city which had 
commissioned his treatise Besides providing funding and shelter Vives also 
suggested the state should provide education to the poor and unskilled who 
as he argued could not be blamed for their fate His propositions for a secular 
poor relief system fell by the wayside amid the religious wars of the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries Nonetheless an emphasis on the provisioning 
of education for impoverished children remained a crucial part of nascent 
welfare policies as evidenced in the writings of among others the Moravian 
theologian and pedagogue John Amos Comenius 15921670
While the practical achievements of humanist scholars remained rather 
modest their works inspired social relief legislation in Western Europe 
through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and marked a decisive step 
towards the development of modern welfare policies and social engineering
including the unfortunate belief that a wellfunctioning community urban 
and national requires cultural homogeneity excluding marginalised groups
Population Policies and Statistics
There was one longterm ambition that was a more consistent goal in many 
early modern states namely the goal of increasing the territorial population 
It was on the agenda more consistently because the number of people living 
in a polity had a direct impact on its fiscal and military power Italian thinker 
Giovanni Botero c 15441617 and French political philosopher Jean Bodin 
15301596 in this sense equated population with the wealth of a state 
Efforts to increase the population potentially touched on peoples everyday 
livesbut once again they were rarely enforced and did not seem to have 
had a fundamental impact on peoples reproductive behaviour There are few 
indications of their success with the sole exception of some major waves of
