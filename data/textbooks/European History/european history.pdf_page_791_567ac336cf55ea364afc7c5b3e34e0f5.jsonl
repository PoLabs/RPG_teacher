through major changes thanks to improvements in materials vehicle design 
and energy management due to improved horse breeding Thus the number 
of kilometres covered without stopping by stagecoaches increased from about 
nine kilometres in 1780 to twentytwo kilometres in 1850 In this respect the 
travel revolution preceded the railway The same dynamic can be observed 
for canals Canals play a decisive role in the history of European transport 
Many had been built over many centuries but the nineteenth century marked 
a change of scale Thus well before the railway revolution the land transport 
revolution already accentuated the differentiation of the European space 
Hence in the case of France around 1840 we can counterpose a northern 
France equipped with a dense network of canals and roads to a southern and 
western France still unequally served Similar contrasts can be observed in 
Italy and Germany 
From the 1810s onwards on the Thames and on the Rhine steamships 
became the norm The decisive progress was based less on the increase in 
speed than on the phenomenal increase in carrying capacity This revolution 
in transport made it possible to envisage the crossing of seas and oceans in a 
different way this boom in maritime transport led to a considerable growth 
in port cities brutally accelerating the phenomenon of global coastalisation 
Steam was also the cause of an upheaval in the means of land transport 
Railways had existed since the late eighteenth century in the mining countries 
of Western Europe wagons on rails pulled by animals were used to move 
the ore But the advent of steam traction changed everything The first trials 
took place in the 1820s and the first general traffic line was opened in 1830 
between Manchester and Liverpool The British origin of the phenomenon led 
to the imposition of the standard gauge of 142 metres almost everywhere
the standard to which the first locomotives exported by Britain were built The 
railway made it possible to move heavy loads of people and goods without 
having to deal with the geography of water It thus became possible to deeply 
reshape the geography of the European continent The availability of transport 
infrastructure had already been of great importance to Britain even before the 
nineteenth century for several centuries the expansion of the British Empires 
boundaries had taken place owing to a powerful navy and the domination of 
global trade routes with trading outposts gradually turning from informal 
to formal empire The arrival of the railways in the nineteenth century gave 
imperial Britain several advantages more immediate access to raw materials 
and markets as well as the faster movement of troops and effective repression 
to imperial hotspots In the process former backwaters such as the Midlands 
and the northern reaches of England were transformed into booming industrial 
centres while farflung colonies such as India received railways and a modern 
infrastructure
