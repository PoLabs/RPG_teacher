programme containing concrete steps towards a future socialist or communist 
society to be carried out by an organisation of workers whose capture of the 
power of the state was the instrument needed to achieve these goals
This brief typology of the main ideologies defining the political spectrum 
around the turn of the century were in practice mostly ideal types Many 
political movements came to represent a hybrid of these ideologies mixed in 
with various local influences A prime example of such a hybrid ideology was 
Zionism A strict typology of ideologies thus disregards internal inconsistencies 
and disagreements within ideologies 
Conservatives and Liberals
One important aspect of the transformation of ideology into a programme 
for social revolution or reform is its function in mobilising people to follow 
the ideological vanguard towards utopia In the first decades of the twentieth 
century tremendous developments in mass media and communications 
enabled ideas to travel far both geographically and sociallyfrom the 
intellectual urban elite to a wider working class in both the cities and the 
countryside As a result ideology became expressed in enticing slogans and 
formulaic arguments aimed more towards mobilising the alreadyconverted 
masses than convincing political opponents
This shift in the nature of ideology had a serious impact on conservative and 
liberal politicians and their followers These figures had thus far justified their 
political dominance in most of Western Europe by the claim that their ideas 
were the rational and impartial views of bourgeois menthose with sufficient 
property to have a stake in society and an interest in social order and stability 
Political contestation thus remained limited to civilised parliamentary debate 
between men with money Yet these men were largely defenceless against the 
claim that every decent and productive member of society should have equal 
political rights Middleclass women notably supported the feminist cause for 
the right to vote often to the consternation of most men Yet both liberals and 
conservatives also became increasingly concerned that the social question 
put on the agenda by socialists in the 1870s was indeed the result of genuine 
flaws in the capitalist social order
In response conservatives at the turn of the century tried to find a new 
social basis for support by embracing nationalism as a tool to mobilise larger 
groups of people They also merged with confessional groups with whom 
they shared concerns about the disruption of familial and communal ties by 
the corrosive effects of capitalism as well as a distrust in the subversion of 
social hierarchies by the egalitarian logic of democratisation
