Different political entities and selfgoverning bodies started to register their 
inhabitants for several reasons the two most important being taxation and 
state control The period from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century also 
saw the written form take precedence over oral tradition throughout Europe 
This led both individuals and administrative bodies to produce more detailed 
registers than ever before
The act of registering people is not an early modern invention some forms 
of census existed in Ancient Rome as well as in several medieval polities 
cities and ecclesiastical bodies Conscription and taxation data have their 
methodological limitations as these sources were not created to come to an 
estimate of the complete population or its demographic features Nonetheless 
some of the sources provide data that allow for estimates of population 
dynamics The appearance of registers for tax religious tithe and state tax 
household and estate conscriptions church registers and canonical visitations 
appeared in different phases of the early modern period in different parts of 
Europe but ultimately most polities created similar records There is however 
an almost complete lack of overall population surveyscensusesuntil the 
eighteenth century It was only at the beginning of the eighteenth century that 
the first proper censuses were conducted in northwestern Europe Denmark 
Iceland Prussia and Sweden are pioneers in this respect In the latter half 
of the eighteenth century many Western and Central European polities also 
began to recognise the importance of conducting surveys of their populations 
As a result by the turn of the nineteenth century there were complete censuses 
or at least initiatives to carry them out in the majority of Europes polities
For most of the early modern period however scholars rely on partial 
datasets that were put down in writing for purposes other than surveying 
complete populations While some of them like parish registers provide data 
that allows a better understanding of demographic features than many early 
censuses these early modern sources all survive in highly scattered forms even 
in areas with the best source coverage such as the Low Countries England 
France or Italy Even if parish registers have survived it is challenging to 
reconstruct demographic processes or family structures from them Other 
sources such as tithe and other tax records as well as estate conscriptions 
such as land registers manorial rolls and urbariaall forms of recording 
property ownership also provide information that in many cases censuses do 
not However these sources present different methodological barriers from 
church registers While some of them cover major areas such as tithe records 
for particular regions of Europe or state tax records kept by some polities 
they do not concern wider populations only individuals who had holdings 
and thus could potentially pay taxes Women except widows elderly people 
who lived in someone elses household servants apprentices and children
