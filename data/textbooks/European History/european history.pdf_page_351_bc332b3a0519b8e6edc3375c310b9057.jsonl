33 REVOLUTIONS AND CIVIL WARS
331
remained permanent in the Netherlands with a predominantly Protestant 
north and a Catholic southtodays Belgium Other major civil wars in the 
early modern period were caused principally by religious divisions too This 
is not surprising in a period when on the one hand religion was of primordial 
importance in peoples lives while on the other hand different variants of 
Christianity claimed to be the only route to Gods grace and to eternal life The 
French Wars of Religion 15621598 and the Thirty Years War in Germany 
16181648 were both civil wars of this kind although they would have ended 
considerably sooner had they not intersected with longstanding factional 
and dynastic strife as well as interventions from the outsidea feature of 
practically all civil wars
Factional or dynastic strife combined with outside interventions also 
fuelled a number of civil wars smaller in scope that were caused neither by 
fullblown revolution nor by religious strife This goes for among others the 
midseventeenth century Fronde in France a series of extremely bloody 
feuds of various groups and factions against the despised regime of Cardinal 
Mazarin It also applies to the Portuguese and Catalan uprisings against the 
Spanish King in the 1640s of which only the former was successful France 
used this opportunity to intervene on behalf of the separatists Spain soon 
returned the favour and intervened on behalf of the Frondeurs There was a 
concentration of internal feuds and civil wars in the decades around the mid
seventeenth century from Portugal and Catalonia through France and England 
to Germany Each scenario had its own specific roots and circumstances but 
apart from marking a final apogee of confessional strife this concentration 
also expresses the fact that across Western Europe princely dynasties now 
consolidated their power over large territories triggering massive resistance 
from various regional and factional elites As a rule princes gained the upper 
handalthough in Germany this was not the case for the Emperor but for 
the individual regional princes In England too royal power was essentially 
restored in 1660 only to be limited some thirty years later by the bloodless 
Glorious Revolution
Eastern Europe
As in Western Europe some civil wars of early modern Eastern Europe took 
on international significance Such was the case for example in the Hungarian 
civil war of the sixteenth century in which Austria and the Ottoman Empire 
took part as neighbouring countries each supporting different kings who 
claimed the Hungarian throne The war ended in a split of the Kingdom of 
Hungary The western part was ruled by the Habsburgs while the larger 
eastern part became a vassal of the Ottoman Empire
