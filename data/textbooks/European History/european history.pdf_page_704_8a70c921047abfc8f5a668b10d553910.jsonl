Due to economic cycles unemployment varies across time and space In 
a broader perspective we can define four phases of unemployment patterns 
see Figure 3 From the late nineteenth century to the First World War 
unemployment rates were relatively low and cyclical variations were moderate 
This changed after 1918 and shot upward in the years of the Great Depression 
After the Second World War development was different for about twenty 
years most Western European states faced an economic boom with very low 
unemployment rates Since the 1970s with the oil crisis overproduction and 
economic change unemployment increased Further increases hit after 1990 in 
the Eastern European stateswhere unemployment had previously been low 
and relatively hidden from viewand the peaks of the economic cycle were 
higher than at the beginning of the twentieth century

number of paid sick days among the approximately 14 million members of the 
health insurance system in Germany already amounted to almost 114 million 
in 1910 And in 2000 in Europe each person got between six Lithuania and 
twentyfour Czechia paid sick day allowances see Figure 4
