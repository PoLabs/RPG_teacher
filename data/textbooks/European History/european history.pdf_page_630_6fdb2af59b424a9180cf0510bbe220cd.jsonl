UNIT 5 ECONOMY
610
economy which celebrated the liberal economic system based on competition 
and free from regulatory mechanisms In their theories of income distribution 
classical economists such as Adam Smith 17231790 or Thomas Robert 
Malthus 17661834 stressed the importance of functional relations between 
rent wage and profits but did not explicitly address the moral and political 
dimension of wage income in the wealth distribution It was only their 
successor the English political economist John Stuart Mill 18061873 who 
on the margins of his magnum opus Principles of Political Economy 1848 noted 
that the distribution of wealth depends on the laws and customs of society 
The rules by which it is determined are what the opinions and feelings of the 
ruling portion of the community make them and are very different in different 
ages and countries
Mill unlike his predecessors could respond to debates about the need 
for social reform and redistribution of societys wealth to ensure at least a 
minimum standard of living for the growing army of the urban industrial 
poor The growing social criticism directed against economic liberalism and 
its callousness towards the working poor had been strongly manifested since 
the end of the Napoleonic Wars The French theorist Henri de SaintSimon 
17601825 pioneered the idea of socialism and envisioned a meritocratic 
society in which wealth and privileges would no longer decide ones status
