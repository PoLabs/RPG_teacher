Introduction

Association of History Educators Euroclio gave us important feedback on 
the structure of this teaching resource and did invaluable work in making the 
knowledge of this handbook available to a broad public beyond academia
There are many individuals who have helped to make this project a success 
and to whom we are deeply indebted The members of our advisory board
Joanna Wojdon University of Wroclaw Simina Badica House of European 
History Brussels and Oscar van Nooijen International Baccalaureate 
Organization Den Haagprovided us with invaluable feedback and advice 
throughout this time Justine Faure and Isabelle Surun Universit de Lille 
Heike Wieters and Paul Treffenfeldt HumboldtUniversitt zu Berlin and 
Martial Staub University of Sheffield helped us get the project off the ground 
and to establish it at their institutions The project would not have run nearly as 
smoothly without the tireless work of our project secretary Miranda Renders 
Utrecht University 
This handbook is intended for undergraduate students in an international 
classroom Over the course of the project we invited several groups of students 
from all involved institutions to read and discuss selected chapters with a 
critical eye and whenever this representative audience had the feeling that 
the scope content or structure of this handbook did not serve its purpose we 
went back to the drawing board We are grateful for their time enthusiasm 
and critical engagement with our project Most of all we are thankful for the 
hard work by our colleagues all over Europe under often extreme conditions 
Their successful collaboration over three years reconciling often very different 
academic cultures working habits school holidays and ideas about history
writing is the foundation of this truly European endeavour
