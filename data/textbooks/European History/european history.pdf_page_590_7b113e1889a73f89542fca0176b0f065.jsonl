families were heavily indebted By 1801 Russia owed 137 percent of its annual 
state income to Hope  Co an enormous sum
The trade between East and West allowed a small elite of landowners and 
a limited number of seaports to accumulate a considerable amount of wealth 
Thus the Germanspeaking city of Danzig was Polands biggest and only port 
of significance Knigsberg was Danzigs equivalent in East Prussia and in 
Russias case the new capital of St Petersburg founded in 1703 assumed this 
role alongside Riga in Livonia The immense wealth of these few towns stood 
in stark contrast to their poor hinterlands
It is worth noting that the process of integration of the European economies 
and the demographic and economic growth of Western Europe led to a 
stabilisation of the folwark or manorial system in Eastern Europe Eastern 
European noblemen in Austria Hungary PolandLithuania Prussia and 
Russia could deliver grain at cheaper prices than Western European countries 
While Western European landowners were obliged to pay wages their East 
European counterparts could forgo these expenses on account of the corve 
of the peasantry This represented the key difference between Western and 
Eastern European economies 
Conclusion
In recent years a major theme of early modern economic history has been the 
divergence between Europe and Asia with debates about the timing of this 
shift and its causes In terms of the latter historians have tended to either 
highlight changes internal to Europe such as new energy sources or political 
regimes and cultural beliefs supporting enterprise or Europes often predatory 
relationship with other regions Ostensibly the themes of this chapter might be 
seen to fit most with the first of these explanatory frameworks New forms of 
business organisation including those which aided the integration of eastern 
and western economies might appear to be a sign of European success in 
cultivating dynamic enterprise However this chapter has shown that these 
innovations were often associated with Europes global interactions and 
the interEuropean competition this entailed European rulers might have 
been compelled to respect private property rights internally but this was 
accompanied by expropriation overseas European states were also willing 
to deploy violence when infringing on each others claimed monopolies 
which they did in alliance with private agents This is a sign of how although 
the early modern period saw important innovations in global enterprise 
that foreshadowed later developments in business organisation there were 
important differences For instance in the different political climate of the 
nineteenth century its military and political functions would make the EIC
