UNIT 3 POWER AND CITIZENSHIP
332
In the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth it was more common for 
rebellions of the nobility to take on the character of civil wars The Hen War 
of 1537 is widely seen as the first rebellion of the Polish nobility Noblemen 
demanded that King Zygmunt I Stary The Old relinquish parts of a planned 
implementation of reforms that would establish a provisional centralised 
government However the noblemen were not confident enough to confront 
Zygmunt I Stary by force Some of their demands were accepted but most 
were rejected The Hen War is therefore seen as a failure for the nobility
Perhaps the bestknown civil war in early modern PolandLithuania 
was the Zebrzydowski uprising 16061607 in which parts of the nobility 
opposed the abolition of the elective monarchy and its replacement by a 
hereditary monarchy The rebellion was crushed by King Zygmunt III Wasa 
and his supporters However Zygmunt abandoned his initial plans and in 
1609 reintegrated the rebels into the political system In 16651666 Poland 
experienced another uprising led by Jerzy Lubomirski against higher taxes 
Lubomirskis troops defeated the army of Jan II Kazimierz Wasa in 1666 A 
compromise was settled and Jan later abdicated The Lubomirski uprising 
was therefore more successful It also marked the end of the Wasa Dynasty in 
PolandLithuania
In the eighteenth century struggles in the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth 
were exploited in the foreign policy of neighbouring states which instructed 
and financed the noble confederations After 1770 PolandLithuania was 
under extensive Russian influence The 1792 Targowica Confederation
under the patronage of Russian Empress Catherine the Greatwas the last 
confederation to oppose political reforms in Poland above all it advocated 
repealing Europes first modern constitution the Ustawa rzdowa of May 1791 
After the 1793 second partition of PolandLithuania between Russia and 
Prussia an uprising led by Tadeusz Kociuszko 17461817 against Russia 
in 1794 is seen as the first national uprising powstanie by historians as Poles 
fought without help from abroad
In Russia rebellions and civil wars were rarer Historians consider the 
transition period after the extinction of the Rurik Dynasty and the accession of 
Mikhail I of the Romanov Dynasty in 1613 as a form of civil war This period 
was later called the Time of Troubles smuta In addition the exclusion of 
the Old Believers during Patriarch Nikons reform of the Russian Orthodox 
Church in the middle of the seventeenth century exhibited some elements of 
a civil war The bestknown rebellion in Russia of the early modern period is 
the Pugachev Rebellion 17731774 The peasant leader Emelyan Pugachev 
organised an army of farmers and Cossacks in centralsouthern Russia 
claiming to be Tsar Peter III and promising land reform and the expulsion 
of the nobility After some initial success Pugachev was captured in 1774 by 
troops loyal to Empress Catherine the Great and later executed
