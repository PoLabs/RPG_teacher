Borders remained porous and easy to cross for a long time with passports 
being rather rare and not strictly necessary for international travel until the time 
of the First World War In the interwar period Austrian writer Stefan Zweig 
18811942 nostalgically reminisced about his youthful travels to America 
and India before the Great War when he was never asked for a passport nor 
had he ever seen one Moreover passports did not constitute proof of national 
identity until well into the nineteenth century For instance British passports 
were written in French and granted to both British and foreign nationals until 
1858 
However as borders between states were being consolidated throughout 
the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth century border checkpoints 
and controls became more frequent and commonplace A hardening of border 
controls as well as a stronger conflation between passports and national identity 
started with the economic slump of the 1870s when a number of European and 
nonEuropean governments decided to introduce antiimmigration policies of 
border control These were aimed at groups of people deemed undesirable
see for example the 1885 expulsion of Poles from imperial Germany or the 
1905 Aliens Act in Britain against destitute foreigners who were mostly 
Jews from the pogromridden Tsarist Empire In the words of the writer Matt 
Carr this spelt the beginning of a bordered world based on paper walls
Conclusion
Europe saw a massive redrawing of borders at the beginning of the nineteenth 
century in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars It underwent a gradual process 
of state centralisation and a concomitant process of nationdefinition and 
nationbuilding all of which went handinhand with a clearer demarcation 
of national and imperial borders and the slow but nevercomplete breakdown 
of internal regional borders Just as physical borders were tightening up and 
becoming less porous social and economic pressures set in motion millions of 
people in search of a better life making use of new transport and infrastructural 
possibilities to reach the destinations of their dreams On the one hand mental 
geographies of hope made the crossing of borders and population relocation 
possible on a mass scale On the other hand equally persistent mental maps 
tied other people steadfastly to their village region or religion and for a long 
time remained in stark contrast to newly defined state borders By the time 
that these mental maps had come to approximate actual state borders and 
statedirected national identities the First World War had broken out and set 
Europe on yet another course of major territorial transformation
