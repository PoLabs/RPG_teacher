Introduction
One defining feature of the early modern period as traditionally understood 
is the expansion of European influence across the globe initiated by the 
exploratory voyages of Columbus and Vasco da Gama As well as marking the 
beginnings of modern European empires and the subsequent expropriation 
of land and resources the position of Europe within the Eurasian economy 
was transformed by direct sea access to its Chinese and Indian Ocean 
heartlands Importantly this was a competitive process amongst European 
states which adopted different institutional solutions to the problems of 
accessing and controlling distant markets This chapter begins by discussing 
how the Portuguese and Spanish empires attempted to secure the gains of 
their overseas possessions through the regulation of shipping and traffic By 
the late sixteenth century the Iberian monopoly was under pressure from the 
northern European Atlantic powers and both the Dutch Republic and England 
came to rely on novel corporations to spearhead their challenges Institutional 
innovation was thus associated with intraEuropean competition for global 
leadership as well as a great divergence between a Europe heading towards 
industrialisation and the rest of the world the early modern period saw 
divergences within Europe and a shift in the economic centre from south to 
north This cannot wholly be explained with reference to the global economy 
the divergence between the labour regimes of Western and Eastern Europe 
had deeper roots Divergence does not preclude integration however and 
the chapter ends by considering how the rise of the Northwestern European 
economies influenced the development of those East of the Elbe
