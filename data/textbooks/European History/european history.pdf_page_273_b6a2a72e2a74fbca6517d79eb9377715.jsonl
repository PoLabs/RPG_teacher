by Lenin in 1921 and the NEP New Economic Policy followed which 
established a mixed economy factories could be privately owned and land 
was in the hands of the peasantry Stalin broke with this policy in 1929 
Under his leadership privately owned factories and land were transformed 
into state property While income inequalities radically decreased in the Soviet 
Union the omnipotence of state ownership created new inequalities between 
ordinary people and the party cadres nomenklatura who controlled the 
means of production and the distribution of wealth in the whole of society 
The failure of the socialist experiments and workers revolts that took 
place after 1918 in countries such as Germany Italy and Hungary led to the 
consolidation of the capitalist order which still preserved some of its former 
feudal characteristics in Southern and Eastern Europe Redistribution of 
landwhere it happenedwas often at the expense of ethnic minorities This 
however could not satisfy the demands of the peasantry Instead of democratic 
rule authoritarian regimes were formed in countries such as Poland Hungary 
Romania and Yugoslavia In Italy Mussolinis fascist movement grasped 
political power and crushed the labour movement Intensifying class conflicts 
and the survival of a semifeudal society led to civil war in Spain which ended 
with the defeat of the leftwing forces
Class inequalities were overall greater in lessdeveloped countries than 
in Western Europe In addition in many Eastern and Southern European 
countries a feudal caste system further increased social distance between the 
poor peasantry and the landed classes
The end of the Second World War brought about a division between the 
capitalist west and the socialist east While there was a civil war between 
the political right and left in Greece this ended with the defeat of the latter 
The landed classes in the socialist east were deprived of their estates and the 
churches also lost much of their property The aim of the communist regimes 
that were established through Soviet support in Eastern Europe was to create 
a classless society where all political power belonged to the working class
After the collapse of the communist regimes new class inequalities were 
formed in Eastern Europe and the distribution of wealth became much more 
unequal than before Private property now played a much greater role in 
creating social differencesthis was a new phenomenon for many people who 
were accustomed to a more equal society Public goods such as free education 
and healthcare were also seen as important achievements of socialism This is 
why communist nostalgia should not be dismissed as a false consciousness 
many people sincerely regretted the loss of the socialist communities and 
the former networks where the market was much less important in creating 
inequalities than in the new capitalist societies
