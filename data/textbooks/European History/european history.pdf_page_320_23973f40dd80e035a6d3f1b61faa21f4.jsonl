In North America where English settlers established the first permanent 
colony in Virginia colonisation only took off in 1607 Remarkably many leading 
figures of American colonisation such as Walter Raleigh had experience in the 
English exploitation of Ireland showing how previous experience influenced 
early modern imperialism In the Caribbean and South America English 
traders established plantation colonies attempting to copy the Portuguese and 
Spanish successes in growing sugar A third variety emerged along Asian and 
African coasts where chartered European companies engaged in the trafficking 
of humans for colonial plantations and the trade in highvalue commodities 
Empire thus started out as a string of trading stations and fortifications along 
the coasts 
Allegedly the first Englishman to refer to empire was the polymath and 
advisor to Queen Elizabeth I John Dee 1527c1609 However his call for 
a British Empire only took off in the eighteenth century a development 
closely related to the composite nature of Britain after the Treaty of Union 
1706 The Dutch in contrast in their struggle against Habsburg domination 
had developed political theories of Republicanism and established the Dutch 
Republic in 1588 These theories also affected their overseas expansion 
empires such as that of the popish Spaniards were prone to rise and decline it 
was claimed trade profits were the rationale of Dutch overseas expansion As 
a result the Dutch never sat comfortably with the term empire incidentally 
nor did the Ottomans for different reasons who called their political entity 
which they did not deem a colonial empire the Sublime Ottoman State
Although English trade and expansion had a vigorous beginning their 
efforts were in many placeswith the exception of North Americaoutpaced 
by the Dutch Initially avoiding the Iberian powers the Dutch grew increasingly 
bold From the 1620s to 1650s they succeeded in pushing the Portuguese to 
the margins in Asia firmly establishing themselves in south and southeast 
Asia In the Americas they briefly wrested Brazil from the Portuguese but 
after 1650 they retreated retaining only small footholds in the Caribbean
In Russia empire was only formally proclaimed in 1721 after the Tsars 
victory over longterm rival Swedena large empire itself at this pointin 
the protracted Northern War And yet despite this late formal proclamation 
Russias selfimage as an empire had emerged centuries prior After the fall of 
Constantinople Russian rulers began to frame the expanding Principality of 
Moscow as the third Rome the defender of Orthodox Christendom Ivan 
IV the Terrible formally adopted the title tsara Russian rendering of the 
Latin caesarin 1547 Since then grandiose rhetoric framed Moscow as the 
only legitimate heir to the Roman Empire 
Although Ivan IV wanted access to the Baltic Sea Russia failed to capture 
this region until the eighteenth century It proved more successful in the East 
The incorporation of the Muslim khanates of Kazan 1552 and Astrakhan
