from the 1840s Belgium the German states France and the Netherlands all 
launched their particular versions of industrialisation In Southern and Eastern 
Europe however growth remained limited to pockets in Spain and Northern 
Italy until the late nineteenth century while territories East of Germany 
generally witnessed the arrival of industrial capitalism in the agricultural 
sector due to their orientation toward supplying the West 
Besides the spatial differentiation growth also showed considerable 
variation over time Contemporary economists were quick to recognise 
patterns in such fluctuations and identified their cyclical nature based on their 
analysis of prices First Clement Juglar 18191905 described trade cycles of 
seven to nine years followed by Nikolai Kondratievs 18921938 sixtyyears
long waves associated with demographic data and technological innovations 
Indeed prices in the now relatively integrated European market witnessed 
similar longrun trends While prior to the 1800s such cycles were much 
shorter with downturns appearing every three to four years and instances of 
sustained growth over a period of several years were rather scarce with the 
transition from agriculture to trade and manufacturing as leading economic 
sectors cycles of growth extended initially to about six years and downturns 
wereunder these conditionsof relative rather than absolute nature as 
before However the stabilisation of modern economic growth on the continent 
brought steeper swings from the 1870s on decline between the mid1870s and 
mid1890s the period of the socalled Long Depression was substituted by 
rapid growth associated with high inflation prior to the First World War the 
so called Belle poque 
Industrialisation Productivity Innovation Production
This economic period was long called an industrial revolution based on the 
scale of significant economic change it saw Referring to it as a revolution evoked 
the rapid and drastic nature of the change and transformation taking place in 
industry which was similar in consequence to the social change caused by the 
French Revolution As noted above it has now become commonplace among 
economic historians to argue that industrialisation is a more appropriate 
term to describe this change Economic growth was not of such a rapid and 
radical scale to justify the revolutionary marker but was rather a longterm 
sometimes fluctuating but continuous change
The nineteenth century was an era of industrialisation throughout Europe 
although in England the process began as early as the mideighteenth century 
European countries did not progress in industrialisation at the same time 
at the same pace or in the same way but by the nineteenth centuryin one 
way or anotherthe change had already reached all European regions
