towards the industry and later services These changes had their roots in the 
nineteenth century but gained new speed after the First World War
When it comes to agricultural production wheat production in particular 
rose greatly from the mid1920s onward because of an increasing demand 
from the industry but also because Russia as the largest grain exporter had 
disappeared from the market As a result other mostly eastern European 
countries increased their wheat output while the USA exported large amounts 
of wheat to Europe as well This trend of increasing production in agriculture 
while employment shares dropped continued after the Second World War 
The sharp decline in the agricultural workforce from more than sixtysix 
million in the whole of Europe in 1950 to 176 million in 2000 was both cause 
and effect of technologisation processes like irrigation tractors hybrid seeds 
fertilisers and pesticides Supported by considerable state protection and 
investment like the Common Agricultural Policy of the EEC agricultural 
production reached its peak in Western Europe in the 1980s
Over the course of the twentieth century the share of people working in 
the secondary and tertiary sectors increased throughout Europe During the 
1920s industrial production in Northwestern and Southern Europe quickly 
surpassed prewar levels This was as true for coal which remained the most 
important primary energy source in the first half of the twentieth century as 
it was for steel This period saw the rise of the motor industry and electrical 
engineering as important new sectors of industry Meanwhile the Germans 
kept dominating the chemical industry and strengthened their position by 
merging the leading companies into IG Farben in 1925 The United Kingdom 
countered by undertaking similar action with Imperial Chemical Industries 
These two national conglomerates controlled the global trade in chemicals 
throughout this period In the 1930s the Great Depression hit industrial 
production in Europe hard Germany was among the countries that suffered 
most severely from the economic crisis becauseamong other reasons
countries suddenly stopped providing them credit with unemployment 
exploding as a consequence 
After the devastations of the Second World War industrial supply and 
demand started to boom culminating in the golden age of the 1950s and 
1960s Household appliances like refrigerators and microwaves televisions 
and automobiles together with processed food and leisure products 
were both driving and responding to new markets and societal changes 
Efficiency and productivity became the magic words of these decades for 
manufacturing resulting in new modes of mass production technological 
innovation and specialisation which made these products affordable for the 
masses Production and consumption were bound in an upward cycle falling 
prices led to an increase in demand that in turn made possible economies of
