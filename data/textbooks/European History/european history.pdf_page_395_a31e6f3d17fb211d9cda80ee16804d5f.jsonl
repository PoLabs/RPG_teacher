visual range to an early form of remote warfare beyond the hill Because of 
technological improvements in rifles firepower explosive shells guns and 
accompanying infrastructures thanks to innovations in metallurgy warfare 
was carried out increasingly in trenches with the Crimean War 18531856 
as the first largescale manifestation of this development In the leadup to 
the First World War machine guns chemical weapons landmines and early 
armoured tanks were already being tested and introduced Many of these new 
techniques were tested in colonial territories and at sea leaving Europe and 
the Americas more or less peaceful until the FrancoPrussian War 18701871 
and the American Civil War This highcasualty war between the US North 
and South is generally considered to be the first industrially fought war in 
modern history
Peace and Prosperity 
The theory of the long peace was compounded by Paul Schroeder in his 
seminal work The Transformation of Europe Schroeder traced the intricate 
diplomatic settlement in and beyond Europe from 1763 to 1848 with a pivot on 
the Congress of Vienna and the ensuing Concert of Europe in 1815 According 
to Schroeder the trauma and devastations of the previous years had prompted 
the powers of Europe to invent and consolidate mechanisms of alliance 
buildingnot just in preparation for war but also for maintaining peace The 
European powers tried out new instruments of conflict management which 
in many cases preferred peaceful conflict resolution to the violent assertion of 
interests A new type of diplomacy based on negotiation cooperation and the 
establishment of norms and rules was attempted and ultimately coalesced 
under the title of European Concert in 18141815 
It is important to note that this post1815 system should not be considered 
an era of restoration since there had been no turning back of the clock 
Instead the spirit and essence the fundamental principles and operation 
of the international system  were anything but backward looking were 
instead progressive oriented in practical nonUtopian ways to the future 
Schroeder Indeed part of the explanation for the long peace is the fact 
that the selfappointed and socalled first rank powers France Russia 
Austria Prussia and Britain kept consulting each other in ambassadorial 
and ministerial conferences With only a handful of congresses taking place 
between 1648 and 1815 the generations following 1815 organised conferences 
on almost every issue that plagued international relations conferences on the 
Belgian Question the Papal Question conferences on sanitation on Syria on 
the postal system on seaports and on the organisation of quarantine stations 
across the borders of the European lands
