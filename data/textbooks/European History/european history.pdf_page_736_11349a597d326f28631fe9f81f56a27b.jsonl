liberal democracies Passed in a climate of conflict the 1905 law was initially 
a law of rupture that put an end to a centuryold regime established for the 
Catholic Church by the Concordat negotiated by Napoleon Bonaparte with 
Rome in 1801 and extended by the Organic Articles to the two reformed 
confessions Lutheran and Calvinist and then to Judaism Based on the 
neutrality of the state and the plurality of religions this regime functioned 
with varying degrees of success for about a century The 1905 law separating 
churches and state unilaterally abrogated this treatybased system and 
completed the evolution initiated a quarter of a century earlier by the 
secularisation policy of the Republican Party which aimed to remove society 
from the control of the Catholic Church With the culmination of this policy 
the French Republic no longer recognised any religion this was the end of the 
public service of religion From now on there were to be no legal relations

consider church weddings as private affairs for married couples in addition 
to compulsory civil marriages On the last day of the year a decree was issued 
separating the state and the Church and the Bolshevik Government seized all 
church lands The official religious status of Orthodoxy was denied although 
in January 1918 the freedom of religious and antireligious propaganda was 
also declared 
The decrees led to a marked decline in the power and influence of the 
Russian Orthodox Church It was also caught in the crossfire of the Civil War 
that began later the same year and many leaders of the Church supported the 
white counterrevolutionary forces which would ultimately be the losing side 
According to the main leader of the Communist Party Vladimir Ilyich Lenin 
18701924 a communist regime could not remain neutral on the question of

After the Civil War the Soviet Union officially claimed religious tolerance 
but in practice the government discouraged organised religion and did
