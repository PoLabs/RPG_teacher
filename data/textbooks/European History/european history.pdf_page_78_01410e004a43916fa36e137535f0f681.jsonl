In terms of everyday culture a specific milieu of controlled territory evolved 
during the socialist era The everyday coexistence of the local population with 
military border guards and police forces was acceptedand retrospectively 
rememberedwith mixed feelings a positive sense of security a negative 
sense of omnipresent surveillance the oftenpraised role of border guards in 
building social amenities and producing cultural activities in small border 
towns the abandonment or planned dilapidation of settlements in the border 
zone 
At first sight the post1989 era appeared to overcome these dramatic 
divisions and fears The work of Polish contemporary artist Zbigniew Libera 
illustrates this He drew attention to this profound change with his work Kolarze 
Cyclists 2002 which shows its protagonists calmly removing a border post 
He positioned the cyclists to mimic Wehrmacht soldiers from an infamous 
Nazi propaganda photograph taken in September 1939 during Germanys 
invasion of Polandtwo radically different crossings of the same border 
Characteristic of this fluid regime of territoriality a number of local initiatives

called the idea of open regionalism particularly with regard to the legacies 
of their national neighbours across the border With the enlargement of the

border crossings became a routine experience for most Europeans In 2009 
the Austrian artists Iris Andraschek and Hubert Lobnig conveyed this idea in 
an art installation along the AustroCzech border Amid images of the barbed 
wire that once stood there their work displayed large metal letters posing the 
question where do the borders disappear to

high price for passing crossing or knocking down borders They were equally 
aware of the cost of the painful new allegiances involved in changes of territory 
Several places such as Berlin Trieste Strasbourg LvivLwwLemberg and 
DanzigGdask the latter transfigured in the 1959 novel Tin Drum by German 
writer Gnter Grass symbolise the centrality of the border issue in European 
history
Hence bordersespecially those that cut and dividehave been evoked 
in dozens of twentiethcentury cultural productions lurking as they do in 
the recesses of family and collective memories The novel They Divided the Sky 
1963 by the German writer Christa Wolf illustrates this as does the moving 
Passages 1994 by the Israeli artist Dani Karavan a memorial site at Portbou in 
homage to the German intellectual Walter Benjamin 18921940 who tried to
