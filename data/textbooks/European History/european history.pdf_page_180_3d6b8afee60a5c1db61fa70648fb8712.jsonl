the beginning of the 1970s this rate had fallen to eleven in the case of Sweden 
and to thirty in Poland
An important indicator of the quality of life is life expectancy which rose 
throughout the twentieth century across Europe albeit unevenly The average 
rise in life expectancy was between two and three months per year due to 
medical improvements as well as rising living standards Growth trends were 
visible in Western as well as in Eastern parts of Europe during the 1950s and 
1960s Divergence was evident only in the 1970s and 1980s when Eastern Bloc 
life expectancies grew significantly more slowly stagnated or even declined 
as in the case of the Soviet Union
The historian Edward Shorter classified the decade of the 1960s as the period 
of the second sexual revolution Its typical features were a higher degree of 
sexual permissiveness womens sexual autonomy and the decriminalisation 
of homosexuality One very important factor with respect to liberation of sexual 
relations was increased access to contraception throughout the 1960s When 
Czechoslovak demographers researched this issue in 1956 they recognised 
that more than twothirds of people used a form of coitus interruptus as a 
method of contraception Condoms were acceptable only for one fifth of them 
In the second half of the 1960s hormonal contraception became more readily 
available at least in the West The lack of foreign trade and other economic 
barriers in the countries of the East meant that access to the pill was scarce The 
scarcity of effective and comfortable contraception consequently led to higher 
levels of abortions
Third Break 1970s Start of the Second Demographic 
Transition
The number of people living in Europe grew without respect to declining 
fertility Today the population is twentyfive percent larger than in 1960 
However this has been the case mainly due to Europes positive migration 
balance The decline in fertility observed from the mid1960s has been described 
by some demographic analyses as the process of the second demographic 
transition Its guiding features include sustained subreplacement fertility 
population ageing and the plurality of family arrangements other than 
marriage 
The shift to more individualistic attitudes can also be considered a basis for 
declining fertility Marriage in the meantime had changed in nature along 
with the spread of extramarital births and domestic partnerships Delayed 
entry into parenthood has become a typical feature At the beginning of the 
twentyfirst century firsttime mothers were more than five years older than
