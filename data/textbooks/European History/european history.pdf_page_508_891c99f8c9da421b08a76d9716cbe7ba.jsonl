legacy was perfected particularly in the fight against unemployment which 
was on an unprecedented scale since postwar demobilisation
The crisis that hit all European countries from 1929 onwards weakened 
the social policies already implemented In Germany the serious effects of 
the crisis unemployment galloping inflation led to a reduction in social 
spending unemployment insurance was denounced as an aggravating factor 
in the crisis The system was partially saved by the state in 19301931 with 
a severe reduction in benefits In Great Britain too the crisis weakened 
the system of assistance to the unemployed and cuts were made to the aid 
granted Finally in France despite important measures aimed at promoting 
social progress the Popular Front hardly modified Frances social protection 
policy which remained limited to the social insurance laws of 1928 and 1930
Government action and state intervention in economic life played a decisive 
role during the period of reconstruction and an accompanying role in growth 
during the socalled Trente Glorieuses the prosperous three postwar decades 
from 1945 to 1975 Until the early 1970s most economic policies were inspired

growth In some countries the statist tradition and the influence of socialist 
ideas and organisations meant that interventionism was taken further in 
France numerous nationalisations were carried out between 1944 and 1946 
and similar action was taken in Great Britain after the 1945 Labour election 
victory The other aspect of this coordinating state policy was planning and 
again it was France which led by Jean Monnet was one of the states which 
went furthest in this field
Governments also intervened more and more in the social sphere in 
relations between employers and employees setting minimum wages and 
working conditions duration paid holidays etc by developing education 
and pension schemes or by setting upand this was the great innovation 
of the postwar periodsocial protection systems aimed at ensuring a 
minimum level of security for all Thus in the aftermath of the war the field 
of the welfare state expanded the philosophy of which consisted no longer in 
basing social security on the traditional concept of the employment contract 
and insurance which guaranteed certain elements of the population against 
a limited number of risks but instead basing it on the principle of national 
solidarity the community of the nation should ensure wellbeing for all
Family and Reproduction 
Concerns about transformations associated with modern life lay at the heart 
of widespread debates and new policies on the family and reproduction over 
the course of the century
