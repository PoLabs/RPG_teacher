The Nation in Everyday Life National Identities and 
Indifference
Although it is important to familiarise oneself with intellectual discourses on 
the nation since they carried the central ideas of the period one must not 
confuse them with peoples everyday experience National identity is not 
experienced in the same way by an intellectual living in a capital city as it is 
on the other extreme by an illiterate peasant 
Certainly everyday activities might help to form the nation as a collective 
identity as argued by Anderson even reading the newspaper supported 
the imagination of the nation as a community and tightened social relations 
However in peoples everyday activity the national idea was far from 
omnipresent For instance in Habsburg Central Europe local experiences 
of nationalism were far from homogenous and national consciousness 
was not capable of determining all aspects of life as the works of Pieter M 
Judson have shown This was especially striking in the case of the socalled 
language frontiers where national conflicts were supposedly ubiquitous 
Instead peoples selfidentification did not necessary revolve around the idea 
of the nation and often they did not define themselves with this category 
Neither did they have difficulties adapting themselves to their multilingual 
surroundings they saw an opportunity in this condition rather than an 
anomaly For example to guarantee more possibilities for their children 
families often sent them on holiday to a neighbouring family who spoke 
other languages of the region Such practices were denounced by national 
activists who advocated a view according to which the world was made up 
of separate nations each representing distinct cultures and mutually exclusive 
by nature In this sense one ought to speak more of nationalist conflicts rather 
than conflicts between nationalities In the Habsburg Empire in the face of the 
central imperial administration national activists were increasingly successful 
in their claims and the administration progressively adopted basic elements 
of their worldview Thus the criteria of national belonging made its way into 
several administrative processes As a result people were under obligation to 
declare for example if they were Czech or German even though they might 
not have originally defined themselves with these categories 
However national activists started to portray their regions as an 
agglomeration of several mutually exclusive and closed cultures For them 
the frontiers of these cultures were places of conflict of defining oneself by 
the differentiation from the other at the opposite side of the frontier Although
