their wives from Spain thus reinforcing the Hispanic way of life on the new 
continent Passenger records suggest that at least 13000 Spanish women 
crossed the Atlantic Still intercultural unions grew in number and importance 
In Portugal such unions generated so much concern that the authorities sent 
Portuguese women the horfas de rei to some strategic areas granting them 
dowries and helping them to start families that would ensure loyalty to the 
crown Nonetheless this did not stop the formation of a multicultural society 
over time The same was true along Asian and African coasts where large 
communities of creolised people emerged along with status hierarchies based 
on perceptions of race Such hierarchies characterised virtually all colonial 
empires though the degree of official racism varied and religious conversion 
could mitigate exclusionary policies Still on some imperial peripheries 
including the Eurasian frontier intermarriage was the exception rather than 
the rule
In general the British and Dutch were less keen to colonise their territorial 
acquisitions in the sense of sending European settlers than Russia and 
the Iberian powers British expansion to North America was an exception 
the colonists disembarking in Virginia were the first of more than 350000 
immigrants from the British Isles peopling what became known as the Thirteen 
Colonies Africa and Asia drew much smaller numbers of settlers because of 
the climate the limited size of most possessions and because the chartered 
companies did not allow free settlers Still Dutch activity in Asia was not 
matched by other European powers until the mideighteenth century In the 
course of almost two centuries about one million people travelled on Dutch 
East India Company VOC ships to South Africa and Asia Most of them were 
from other European countries especially the German lands 
Conclusion
Early modern empires for all their diversity and dynamism differed from 
their predecessors in several respects The discovery of the New World and 
improvements in technology and navigation gave them the possibility of global 
reach The compression of time and space emboldened Europeans stirred up 
their rivalries and opened up new possibilities for enrichment 
The late eighteenth century saw some major changes with the independence 
of the Thirteen Colonies 1783 and Haiti 1804 followed by most of Spanish 
America and Brazil by 1824 At the other end of the globe Dutch power in Asia 
declined while from the mideighteenth century the British in India evolved 
from a mercantile presence into a more dominant taxextracting coloniser The 
Dutch made this change more reluctantly continuing to stress the commercial 
nature of their business
