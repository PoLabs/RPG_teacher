boomers Lesbians who often felt marginalised in gay liberation groups 
mounted their own campaigns If the first wave was preoccupied with securing 
the vote and womens constitutional rights the second wave recognised that 
the personal is political leading women to seek radical and innovative 
ways to challenge patriarchal hegemony in the state the workplace in their 
personal relationships and in the family The attainment of sexual equality 
in politics could however be paradoxical When Margaret Thatcher became 
British Prime Minster in 1979 the first elected female leader in Europe she did 
so without any feminist conviction and her government did little to advance 
womens rights
Third wave feminism started in the early 1990s and built on the foundations 
laid in the second wave but brought to the forefront intersectionality 
transfeminism and postmodern feminism Rising out of punk subculture 
known as riot grrl this wave was largely driven by women of colour based 
in the United States who wanted to correct second wave feminisms focus on 
the experiences of white middleclass women Confusion as to what exactly 
third wave feminism is characterises the wave itself In terms of inequality it

different types of inequality intersect to create different problems for different 
groups of people

as combining issues of justice with increasing spirituality In the context of 
contemporary feminism the Everyday Sexism project httpseverydaysexism
com of Laura Bates as well as the more recent MeToo movements are obvious 
examples with a distinct focus on Western societies These social media 
generated campaigns and flashpoints for discussion around the treatment of 
women globally have also resulted in a lot of pushback from the socalled 
manosphere or Mens rights activists some of whom openly argue for a 
return to a socalled natural order where women are subservient to men A 
deep misunderstanding of history frequently permeates these debates with 
the clich image of women as they may have been in Victorian England held 
up as an ideal homemaker childbearer wife Women have long occupied a 
far more active place outside the home and it is debatable to what extent this 
image was even true for the Victorian era 
Racial and Ableist Inequalities
Income wealth and gender were not the only types of inequalities among 
Europeans in the twentieth century Ethnic differences played a key role in 
the nationstates that came out of the First World War after the breakup and 
territorial losses of the Russian and Ottoman Empires and AustriaHungary
