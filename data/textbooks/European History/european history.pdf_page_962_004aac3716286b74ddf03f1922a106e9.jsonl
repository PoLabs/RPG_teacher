As this heritage boom expanded over the course of the 1970s postmodern 
perspectives on culture and identity and a broader cultural turn in the 
discipline of history drew attention to the political and cultural nature of 
heritage and memory Throughout the 1980s academia started to shift its 
attention from solely finding solutions for heritage management to also 
studying how societies and states remember and how they transform things 
from the past into culturally meaningful heritage or even invent traditions 
By the end of the 1990s this research into the power relations which defined 
heritage policy and the Western hegemonic discourses encoded in many 
global heritage conventions began to fundamentally change the way heritage 
was approached 
Many academics called for a more critical stance towards dominant and 
especially institutionalised heritage practices and canons The work of 
Australian heritage scholar Laurajane Smith is particularly important Smith 
coined the concept of Authorized Heritage Discourse critically questioning 
the dominance of Western expertdriven engagements with the past An 
awareness of the important role of Western norms and the role of the state in 
heritage initiatives resulted in the establishment and rapid growth of a new 
fieldCritical Heritage Studies Equally important within this trend are the 
discussions around colonial heritage which intensified throughout the 1990s 
Debates around colonial statues and collections in Europe have not only 
encouraged academics to take a more activist stance but these discussions 
have also ensured that the intrinsically Western conceptions of heritage have 
been challenged
Such calls within academia for sharing authority between experts and 
ordinary people or the decolonisation of heritage practiceswhich as 
mentioned above had their roots in the end of the twentieth centuryhave 
also been adopted outside academia during the beginning of the twenty
first century Over the past decade museums across Europe have embraced 
the idea of becoming participatory and creating room for cocuration 
with citizens and visitors In archaeology citizen science is becoming a 
cornerstone of archaeological resource management Generally four decades 
of critical engagement with the politics of heritage have started to change our 
engagement with the past in the present The sector is increasingly aware of 
the disciplinary dangers intrinsic to heritage and memory work and there is 
also increasing attention to difficult pasts and heritages However polarisation 
and the nationalistic mobilisation of history in the public domain still takes 
place reminding us that heritage will always remain a political issue Slowly 
the discourse around colonial collections is also changing The decision of the 
French president Emanuel Macron to repatriate the socalled Benin bronzes 
artifacts looted from Benin during the colonial period and held in the Quai
