power in Brazil Jair Bolsonaro the US Donald Trump and Hungary 
Viktor Orbnor kept them there as in certain postSoviet states and Russia 
Nursultan Nazarbayev Alexander Lukashenko and Vladimir Putin
At the same time these authoritarians who came to power by promising 
security and prosperity to their supporters also unleashed new rounds of 
escalating violence crisis and mayhem in their own countries and worldwide 
Once more as in the 1970s and 1980s rightwing terrorism seems to be piggy
backing on the alleged fourth wave of holy terrorism mainly jihadism 
parasitising on supposed fears for immigration Islamisation the end of 
European civilisation and the alleged selling out of middleclass white 
interests With the threat of the classic Frenchstyle or communist revolution 
receded into the corridors of history the most recent revolutions of the Arab 
Spring in 2011 so far only seemed to have brought forth greater authoritarian 
backlash and repression in the Middle East and Asia along with the European 
populist fallout mentioned above 
Conclusion
The historic and historiographic notions of revolution and civil war can be 
traced back to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when the concepts of 
the international legal system and the unitary state were established In the 
twentieth century the First World War served as a catalyst of the evolving 
longterm ideological struggle between revolution and counterrevolution as 
some interpretations contend The afterwar turmoil nourished by the Bolshevik 
Revolution and by the sentiments of those whose ideas were not fulfilled 
during the war somewhat stabilised around 1923 The 1930s Depression 
however intensified the crisis of legitimacy in the liberal democratic system 
and strengthened calls for alternatives both right and left Traces of these 
clashes can be found in the international dimensions of the Spanish Civil War 
and in intranational conflicts within the Second World War 
The strengthening of the state in postwar Europe along with the new 
Cold War division led to the elimination of interstate warfare as a tool 
of politics But at the same time it gave way to a new wave of politically 
motivated revolutionary violence Even though the goals and ideologies of 
newly emerged terrorist groups were very different their shared imagery and 
discourse led to the interpretation framing them as part of a single wave 
After 1989 the reemergence of nationalism provoked several local 
conflicts The globalised world became the main opponent of various insurgent 
movements many of which could be classified as religious The new era after 
2001 led to reconceptualisation of the notions of terror and asymmetric conflict
