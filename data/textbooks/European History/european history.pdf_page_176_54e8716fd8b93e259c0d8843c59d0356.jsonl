The fourth period the socalled second demographic transition started 
in the mid1960s in the West Individualist attitudes career demands and 
changes in social attitudes including the relaxation of traditional gender 
roles combined with the availability of effective contraceptives led to very 
low fertility The lands behind the Iron Curtain were affected by this process 
later but the transformation of the 1990s had significant impacts on Central 
and Eastern European societies in terms of fertility and this process continues 
to be very dynamic 
First Break The Impact of the First World War
While the first pre1914 phase can be considered as part of the long 
nineteenth century with respect to the European demographic trends that 
were described in the previous chapter events after 1914 set new conditions 
In total the First World War took an estimated seventeen million lives from 
all over the world Additionally it is estimated that the three waves of the 
Spanish Influenza pandemic killed more than fifty million people between 
1918 and 1920 when the world population was estimated to be around 19 
billion Population losses were concentrated in the countries involved in the 
war in Germany or Hungary for example four times as many people died 
as a result of the war than did from influenza in Britain it was three times as 
many in Italy two times as many But in other parts of the world the opposite 
situation prevailed
During the war there was also a sharp decline in birth rates due to family 
disintegration and warinduced misery For instance in the territory of present
day Austria the number of newborns fell from 250000 in 1914 to 140000 in 
1918 Moreover the rate of stillbirths increased slightly during the war as well 
as the number of children born out of wedlock in todays Czech Republic this 
accounted for 05 percent of all births in 1915 rising to 135 percent by 1918 
Germany offers another insightful example A glance at the countrys birth 
rate reveals a significant decrease while in 1900 the birth rate was still 358 
per 1000 inhabitants it dropped to 270 in 1914 when the war started The war 
period itself saw further decreases in the birth rate which dropped as low as 
143 by the end of the war in 1918 
Although the interwar period saw a general decline of emigration from 
Europe immediately after the war population movements were considerable 
In the Carpathian Basin where the population had previously been in decline 
emigration to the American continent continued primarily to Canada after 
the introduction of the quota system in the US But for the masses of people 
becoming minorities in newlyformed states predominantly Hungarians 
seeking refuge in Hungary became the most favourable option for getting by 
In the second half of the interwar period increasingly extremist rightwing
