UNIT 7 CULTURAL ENCOUNTERS

The debate that followed this critique offered people a platform to make 
sense of the rapidly changing gender norms and sexual mores during the 
interbellum The dancehall was a space where members of the opposite 
sex from different social backgrounds unchaperoned could jointly spend 
their leisure time Moral panic arose about this new social arrangement 
especially because the AfricanAmerican dances were considered to be 
sexual in nature Influenced by racist ideas cultural critics dance teachers 
and Dutch governmental committees suggested that the people of colour 
who had developed these dances expressed their perceived primitivism 
and hypersexuality through the wild movements of jerking torsos 
swinging hips and shuddering shoulders These officials considered such 
an inflammatory display of primal and sexual instincts inappropriate for 
modern Europeans who they believed to be civilised and intellectual 
They feared that participation in such movements would arouse dancers 
sexual desires and lead to immoral behaviour such as pregnancies out of 
wedlock
An easy and modern remedy to this was found in the regulation of the 
dancehall and the discipline of dancers Dance teachers adapted African
American dances rejecting the wild movements and developing strict 
guidelines for malefemale interactions to allow the dancers to retain a sense 
of elegance and modesty which they considered to be representative of 
European values Moreover the Dutch government and municipalities 
started to regulate the space of the dancehall for example by issuing laws 
on alcohol consumption and limitations on the maximum number of visitors 
allowed Regulated in this way parents dance teachers and governmental 
organisations believed that the dancehall offered young men and women a 
modern space for a traditional goal finding a marriage partner
However a growing group of women were not so eager to adapt their 
behaviour or to conform to this normative ideal For them dancing was not 
a modern means to a traditional end It was fun They enjoyed the flirtations 
the sensual experience of being held by different men and the ability to move 
their bodies more freely This sometimes led to frustrated or even aggressive 
responses by their male partners In effect for women the dancehall was a 
place where they simultaneously experienced sexual liberation and attempts 
to discipline their bodies according to traditional gender ideals 
The dancehall was a modern space par excellence It was an ambiguous 
place that brought together ideas about primitive traditional and 
modern bodies Most importantly dancing offered people the opportunity 
to experience both the excitement and the anxieties that the new age offered
