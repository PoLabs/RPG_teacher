human exploitation of natural resources In fifteenth and sixteenthcentury 
Holland for instance digging peat for fuel created large inland lakes that 
eroded the shoreline during inclement weather
Early modern societies responded to environmental risks in various ways 
employing both new and traditional methods People often learned from 
experience especially where hazards were repetitive and predictable they 
anticipated recurrences and adjusted to the situation finding ways to live 
with risk Conversely there were also attempts to reduce threats by actively 
transforming the environment This often involved new technology which 
required coordination capital and expert knowledge The development of 
flood defences in Holland is a good example Diking to protect the land from 
flooding had started in the high Middle Ages The first dikes were smallscale 
affairs constructed and maintained by local communities Over the centuries 
short dike stretches were connected raised and reinforced Maintenance 
originally in the hands of farmers was increasingly professionalised and 
entrusted to designated regional organisations called waterboards 
Improvements in milling technology allowed for better drainage Especially 
between ca 1550 and 1660 large areas were reclaimed and transformed into 
agricultural land Funding was often provided by merchant companies while 
technological expertise increasingly came from qualified surveyors In the 
seventeenth century many of them had received formal training at the school 
for military engineers at Leiden University established in 1600forerunner 
to the technical schools that in the eighteenth century were also to appear in 
other European countries
