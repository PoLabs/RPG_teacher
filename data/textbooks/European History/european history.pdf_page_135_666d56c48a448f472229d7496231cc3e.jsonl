to Europe but also provided valuable markets and resources that helped to 
sustain European economies and uphold a measure of political stability 
When Napoleon Bonapartes men invaded Egypt in 17981801 the goal of 
French strategists was not only to cut the jugular vein of Britains imperial 
relationship with India but also to colonise Egypt as a substitute for possessions 
in the West Indies in the meantime recovering Pondicherry and other French 
possessions on the Coromandel and Malabar coasts However the French 
dmarche culminated with fiasco in 1801 as the AngloOttoman forces drove 
the French armies out of the Levant 
After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna in 1815 a new 
interimperial order was established to suspend armed conflict yet colonial 
expansion all over the world continued almost unabated With the piracy of 
the Barbary Corsairs as a pretext the French invaded Algiers in 1830 with 
the exact same purpose of establishing influence in North Africa to compete 
against Britain in the Mediterranean This time the British were preoccupied 
with events at home in Portugal and in the Dutch Kingdom enabling France

an era of European expansionism in Africa By the 1910s with the exception of 
Liberia and Ethiopia the entire African continent was under European colonial

were exploited and along the way millions of lives perished During the anti
colonial resistance in Algeria alone one third of the entire Algerian population 
around one million people passed away due to incessant fighting famine 
and epidemic diseases 
Conscious that colonial competition could spark interimperial wars 
in Africa especially after the unification of Germany and its entry into the 
colonial contest the European powers peacefully shared the lands of Africa 
among their colonies at the Berlin Conference of 18841885 which went down 
in history as the Scramble for Africa 
A scramble for the Middle East never took place in the same explicit fashion 
nor was it ever formally colonised The territories of the Ottoman Empire and 
Persia were too big and too dangerous to swallow and were never annexed in 
one attempt by any of the European powers The Europeans saw an existential 
threat in the annexation of the strategically and economically prized morsels 
from the empires of the Sultan and the Shah any move in this direction could 
upset the balance of power in Europe and engender a general war bringing the 
continent back to the horrors of the Coalition Wars in 17931815 Dubbed the 
Eastern Question this most complicated and dangerous issue of international 
relations of the time indeed prompted the first armed conflict between great 
powers since 1815 the Crimean War of 18531856 Britain and France fought
