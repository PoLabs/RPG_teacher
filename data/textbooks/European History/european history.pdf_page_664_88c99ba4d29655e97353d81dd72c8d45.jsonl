consumer society was no longer a privilege for the rich Throughout the 
nineteenth century consuming became something that defined and shaped 
the everyday life of European citizens in the cities as well as in the countryside 
Consumerism became an integrative force both connecting and distinguishing 
Europeans across social strata as diverse consumer cultures emerged 
Conclusion
During the nineteenth century the frameworks of production and 
consumption changed fundamentally Specialisation a division of labour 
technical innovations and institutional changes transformed production 
productivity increased significantly and industrial production in factories
using machines and power machinesas well as mass production became 
commonplace Productivity growth was characteristic of both agriculture and 
industry This was the era of industrialisation a period when first industry 
and later the service sector became more and more important within the 
economy Along with sectoral change the number of persons employed in 
industry and subsequently in the service sector increased while those living 
from agriculture decreased The age of industrialisation also transformed trade 
and consumption Department stores commercial specialisation and mass 
consumption emerged As part of these economic transformations a modern 
banking and insurance sector developed 
This process characterised the whole of Europe however the commencement 
pace and course of industrialisation varied in different parts of the continent 
In England industrialisation began as early as the eighteenth century 
followed by the countries of Western Europe in the early nineteenth century 
The industrialisation of Eastern and Southern Europe started later as their 
production was initially dominated by the growing demand for food from 
the West This also signalled the extent of globalisation the interconnection of 
markets
As a result of industrialisation economic growth was able to step out of 
the Malthusian trap growth was no longer limited but rose and fell in new 
economic cycles The second half of the nineteenth century was defined first 
by the Long Depression thenbefore the First World Warby the Belle
