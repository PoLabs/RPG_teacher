Changing Economic and Legal Frameworks
The industrial revolution which took hold at different times in different 
countries had profound effects on how households functioned Both the guild 
system and the puttingout system were replaced almost wholesale by factory 
production The rise of factory production and wage labour meant that where 
previously households had operated as units of production goods were now 
increasingly manufactured outside the home This meant that remuneration 
for paid labour became increasingly important as households became ever 
less selfsufficient At the same time an ideal model of family organisation 
emerged among uppermiddleclass families whereby men should earn the 
sole income to support the household with women focused on creating 
a domestic sphere This socalled male breadwinner model persists to the 
present day but its origins are to be found in the time of industrialisation when 
wages that had previously been paid to a household were increasingly paid 
to individuals However this was only ever an ideal In reality particularly in 
poorer households women and children did a lot of work both in and outside 
the home And of course a male breadwinner household could only exist 
if the male of the household was alive and present For many households 
death and disappearance travel for work or conscription to fight in wars 
led to mens absence leaving women and children to make do as best they 
could In many European countries such as Spain Portugal or France the 
concept of the man as an exclusive breadwinner did not become hegemonic in 
the nineteenth century and men welcomed their wives and single daughters 
bringing complementary income homeso long as men remained by law the

Parallel to the advance of industrialisation across much of Western Europe 
there emerged another significant development the rise of the modern 
state In the late eighteenth century and into the nineteenth century states 
around Europe began to develop modern bureaucracies new tax systems 
and comprehensive legal codes which enabled them to know more about the 
families that lived within them These developments also enabled states to 
shape families in new ways largely as a result of the shift in power over daily 
affairs from religious institutions to governmental ones 
This transformation could be seen first of all in the domain of family law 
which became a distinct area of jurisprudence from the eighteenth century 
and began to outline how to deal with areas such as marriage inheritance 
adoption and divorce The emergence of new civil codes in the wake of the 
French Revolution and various subsequent revolutions over the nineteenth 
century also brought about clear rules on matters pertaining to the household 
and family For example the Prussian Civil Code of 1794 declared the purpose
