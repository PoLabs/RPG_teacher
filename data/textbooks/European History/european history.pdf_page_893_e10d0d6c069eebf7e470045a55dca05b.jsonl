of the arena of national or transnational communication A combination of 
different developments in fact altered the spatial organisation of society The 
practice of reading for example changed drastically during the nineteenth 
century While literacy had risen to new heights over the course of the century 
thanks in part to the introduction of new school systems these new reading 
audiences no longer met in public libraries or clubs to exercise reading as a 
social practice in public venues On the contrary at the end of the century 
the vast number of newspapers and books that had become available at least 
to an urban population was mostly read in private The reorganisation of 
space created by new media during the nineteenth century therefore had an 
ambiguous character It started to link people together establishing new realms 
of belonging not least the nation as an imagined community while at the 
same time laying the groundwork for more private and individual practices of 
media use and reception whichto an observer in the twentyfirst century
would appear more recognisable New media also created new divisions for 
example between a media avantgarde in major citiespeople who had access 
to the newest media trends and incorporated them quickly into their lives
and less wellconnected people in Europes peripheral regions 
Conclusion
Europe in the nineteenth century was as diverse as at any point in its 
history and new developments influenced its various regions in different 
ways Nonetheless new technologies for mass communication affected all 
European countries and profoundly impacted and shaped popular culture 
in its cities and more connected regions spreading new ideas creating new 
audiences accelerating the rise of new political parties and classes and 
changing peoples outlooks on the world The new media of the timesuch 
as illustrated newspapers photography or the electric telegraphcreated 
new mass audiences that extended far beyond the elite circles of earlier media 
consumption At the same time they created new divisions between mainly 
urban audiences with easy access to media content and rural or peripheral 
audiences that were often excluded from this new media landscape
The popular culture of the nineteenth century was thoroughly shaped by 
these new media technologies becoming more visual more easily accessible 
and available more political and more urban The novels newspapers and 
images of the period often reflected the transnational nature of this new popular 
culture in both their content and formas was the case with photography and 
cinema which transcended barriers of language At the same time the rise of 
nationalism in the nineteenth century was closely linked to the development 
of new media technologies
