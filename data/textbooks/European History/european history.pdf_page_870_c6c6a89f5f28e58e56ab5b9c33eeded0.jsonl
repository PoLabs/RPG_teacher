such practices had already been provided by the artists and underground 
movements of the abovementioned generation of the 1960s these artists tried 
to breathe life into that idea To be underground in Eastern Europe in this 
period meant not only being different but also being opposed to the state 
ideology
Toward the end of the twentieth century the legacy of the avantgarde 
movements became an integral part of contemporary artistic life as an 
inspiration for individual artists just like any other historical art movement 
Arguably the most important merit of the avantgarde is that it put such 
values as being different openminded and experimental in the limelight not 
only in arts but in all fields of social life
Conclusion
The originality of the avantgardes rests in their promotion of an idea of a 
radical beginning in all parts of lifea longing to create from a tabula rasa to 
make a clean sweep of the past and to start afresh In so doing they sought to 
combine the freedom of the artist with that of art itself In their art the longing 
for a rupture with past conventions was both artistic and sociopolitical art 
aimed to inspire a radical change of the sociopolitical world Nevertheless 
avantgarde art took very different shapes and forms throughout the twentieth 
century reflecting the ideological prerogatives and political ambitions of 
the time In this sense it often ran parallel to the great political revolutions 
world conflicts and cultural revolts of the century Especially the upheaval of 
the First World War but also the rise of ideologies such as communism and 
fascism had a direct impact on avantgardist circles
During the second half of the twentieth century neoavantgardist 
artists retained a longing for experimental research and for rethinking and 
decompartmentalising social and political realities hence they lost some 
of the strictly ideological edge of earlier manifestations The avantgarde 
increasingly signified a fusion between arts and lived experience whereby 
the idea of underground as well as the fusion between high and low 
culture became pivotal In the 1960s such circles gained currency and their 
heterodox way of thinking or representing art ran parallel to or even directly 
reflected sociopolitical movements of the timesuch as the global uprisings 
of 1968 Consequently avantgarde artists contributed to putting values such 
as being different openminded and experimental at the forefront of artistic 
endeavour as well as of society at large The seeds of that development 
continue to blossom up to the present day
