intrinsically better than the handwritten word It was print culture so it was 
thought that allowed the development of public opinion a tribunal that was 
independent of all powers and that would be respected by all powers It is 
certain that building on the developing culture of literacy and the infrastructure 
of reading early modern Europe experienced a boom of applied technologies 
that benefitted trade and communication networks That was made possible 
even if only in part by the printing press
Technological Change Infrastructures and Networking
Early modern technological change is often associated with notions of 
revolution eg the military or scientific revolutions But radical new 
innovations tended to appear sporadically the steam engine and the printing 
press are the most often mentioned exceptions Indeed rather than being 
driven by heroic figures and major inventions technological change developed 
gradually through the expansion and improvement of networks the growing 
intensity of expert exchange and the circulation of knowledge and assisted by 
improvements in transport infrastructures Instead of radical transformation 
technological change often followed a path of gradual improvements based 
on trial and error and learning by doing Science rather than being a driving 
force of technological change itself followed the knowledge and practices 
developed by craftsmen and engineers 
Between 1450 and 1800 European merchants expanded their trading 
networks on a global level leading to their operation of regular transoceanic 
exchanges connecting Europe through seaports with virtually every corner 
of the planet Technological innovations were crucial for this expansion The 
expansion of global contacts facilitated the introduction in Europe of advances 
in shipbuilding such as the Asian lateen sail and leeboard weaponry Chinese 
gunpowder and navigational instruments compass astrolabe all of which 
originated in other parts of the world They were skilfully combined by their 
new users
Efforts of merchants shipbuilders and sailors active in the Dutch trade in 
the Baltic during the sixteenth century led to the development of the fluyt a 
sailing vessel superior to those used by their European competitors Designed to 
facilitate transoceanic trade with a focus on maximum cargo capacity minimal 
crew and low building costs the fluyt marked a significant improvement on 
Mediterranean vessels such as carracks and galleons the original vehicles 
of European expansion By significantly reducing transportation costs this 
new type of vessel contributed to the success of the Dutch Seaborne Empire 
built on an extensive merchant fleet which by the midseventeenth century
