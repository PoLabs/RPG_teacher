74 HERITAGE AND MEMORY
949
Conclusion
Memory and heritage in twentiethcentury Europe have fundamentally been 
shaped by the traumatic events of this period such as the Second World War 
the Holocaust and Cold War divisions These experiences have impacted 
the ways in which European societies deal with the past The later part of 
the century has witnessed an unprecedented concern with these legacies 
It has seen efforts to overcome divisive moments in European history but 
also the instrumentalisation of memory for current political agendas At the 
same time over the course of the twentieth century heritage and memory in 
Europe have seen an internationalisation and a Europeanisation With respect 
to internationalisation the reconstruction of the devastated continent gave 
rise to a new understanding of heritage with urban heritage sites historic 
town centres and heritage cities growing into important international tourist 
attractions This internationalisation was accompanied and shaped by the 
development of new supranational institutions such as UNESCO and 
the establishment of two new academic disciplinesHeritage Studies and 
Memory Studieswhich have provided a critical framework for making sense 
of these processes With respect to Europeanisation amid ongoing European 
integration the later part of the period has seen considerable efforts to cultivate 
a distinctively European heritage and memory
