Sexuality in Europe in the Twentieth and Twentyfirst 
Centuries 
For much of the twentieth century and especially its first half sexuality was 
still understood as the privilege of married couples that were procreative 
heterosexual and monogamous Nevertheless by the 1960s a kind of sexual 
liberation sometimes described in terms of a sexual revolution although it 
was the result of a longterm shift had taken hold within a context of growing 
secularisation and the affirmation of feminist and LGBTQ rights
At the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries 
anarchist and socialist thinkers from Charles Fourier in France to Alexandra
