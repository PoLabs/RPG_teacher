of the Czech Lands was an example of such an internal periphery Largely 
circumvented by industry the territory became notorious for outmigration to 
Prague and Vienna to the northern industrial part of Bohemia and even to 
Americas At the same time the acknowledgement of this peripheral position 
known as the SouthernBohemian Question gave birth to remarkable efforts 
by southern Bohemian regionalists to stimulate locally based development for 
example by turning to the leisure economy while also promoting regionalism 
as a statewide doctrine of territorially balanced development with more 
power given to the provinces Targeted against pragocentrismseen as the 
disproportionate concentration and monopolisation of economic political 
and even cultural power in the capitalregionalists called for a polycentric 
structure with peripheral regions becoming selfsustaining socioeconomic 
and cultural wholes while also being sources of genuine and highquality 
cultural life
Sometimes the provinces could be more offensively positioned against 
the centre In the Germany of the early twentieth century for instance the 
polarity between the provinces and the alltoorapidly evolving Berlin carried 
traits of a pronounced cultural war between metropolitan cosmopolitanism 
and what was promoted as genuinely national German culture In yet 
other contexts peripheral regions were cradles of what has been called 
peripheral nationalism including Scotland Flanders the Basque Country 
and Catalonia As the last example makes clear peripheral regions are not 
necessarily economically disadvantaged parts of the state HansHeinrich 
Nolte has argued that internal peripheries could also be economically 
highperforming regions Yet as they tend to be former independent states 
themselves they are also likely to be units that are politically controlled from 
centres lying elsewhere
Transition toward a second modernity and postindustrial society in the 
late twentieth century put new developments on the map with some of the 
old industrial centres such as northern England turning into peripheries 
Elsewhere areas such as southern Finland became champions of a new 
knowledgebased economy focused on smarttechnologies design but also 
healthy and ecofriendly lifestyles While the spatial hierarchies and disparities 
remain in existence they have nevertheless become more complex and less 
easy to draw on the map with the rich metropolitan areas of the global cities 
coexisting with underdeveloped regions and affluent districts bordering 
with rundown neighbourhoods The cultureled development based on the 
creative industries cultural heritage and tourism became a new panacea for 
many deindustrialised regions and other areas that lagged behind sometimes 
instigated by national or European cultural policies and frameworks such as 
the title of European Capital of Culture In parallel more grassroots movements
