121 Borders in Early Modern History 
ca 15001800
Benjamin Conrad and Markta Kov
Introduction
When thinking about geographical borders of the early modern period 
it is necessary to point out that twentieth and twentyfirstcentury 
conceptualisations of borders are inadequate for that period of history 
A combined customs state and tax border requires a centralised form of 
government but this was rare in the early modern period Moreover states 
need a certain degree of economic prosperity to finance border systems This 
was equally difficult to attain under the circumstances of the early modern 
period
In this chapter the working definitions of the key terms are as follows the 
border is a dividing line the frontier an outer line of expansion The second 
term grows in importance when taking Europes overseas expansion into 
account However there were also frontiers of expansion within medieval and 
early modern Europe such as the Iberian Peninsula Eastern Europe beyond 
PolandLithuania and the Balkans Also the term mental map is used 
throughout the text as it was used by such historians as Larry Wolff to denote 
the way physical space is imagined and represented within a given society 
as a tool for cultural orientation and selfidentification of its members 
For any human community physical borders such as natural features 
as well as manmade marks or barriers and symbolic cultural markers are 
important in establishing the difference between us and themin other 
words the outlining of the community of belonging The question of frontiers 
is strongly connected to this question of identity Establishment acceptance 
affirmation and refusal of identity is necessarily based upon the notion of 
borders 
Barth 1969 brought the attention of social science to the constitution 
of ethnic groups and the nature of boundaries constructed between them
