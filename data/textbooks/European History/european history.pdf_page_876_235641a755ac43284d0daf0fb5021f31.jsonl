UNIT 7 CULTURAL ENCOUNTERS

New Year Carnival May and Midsummer In 1500 Burke argued this was a 
culture in which everyone participated but over the following centuries the 
privileged and affluent steadily abandoned it by 1800 there had been an elite 
withdrawal as ftes frolics and rowdy rituals were considered incompatible 
with the beliefs and behaviours of those higher up the social scale Burkes 
book therefore was both an argument about an important aspect of historical 
societies that should be studied and also an argument about cultural change 
in early modern Europe
Many of the elements of popular culture that Burke brought to light have 
remained prominent in historical research but our understanding of the 
richness complexity and dynamism of popular culture has continued to 
progress We now have a much greater understanding of popular literacy and 
that greater understanding has demonstrated the extent to which the written 
word permeated deeply through society Literacy levels were higher than once 
thought especially in urban areas and many texts were designed to be read 
aloud in sociable settings which meant that even those who were illiterate 
could access them Broadside ballads are a good example they were songs 
printed on singlesided paper and addressed a variety of topics including 
news politics or current affairs as well as other kinds of contemporary 
interests such as courtship or marital relations They were printed cheaply 
costing as little as a penny and were hawked in the streets and pasted on 
tavern walls to be sung aloud and enjoyed in companyoften with the 
consumption of alcohol indeed many of the ballads themselves celebrated 
drinking and drunkenness Historians have also found new ways to access 
the voices of nonelites court records have been particularly fruitful as they 
include witness statements and depositions given by ordinary people As 
Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg argued in his microhistorical study The Cheese 
and the Worms 1980 the case of one miller from Friuli in sixteenthcentury 
Italy named Menocchio and his interrogation at the hands of the Spanish 
Inquisition revealed not only his reading habits and understanding of those 
texts but also his wider religious beliefs and cosmology Court records have 
also been particularly valuable in accessing womens voices and experiences
something notably absent from Burkes account In early modern England 
for example court records have been used to examine popular attitudes 
towards gender relations and identities morality and understandings of sex 
and reproduction Her work and others like it has helped to focus attention 
on how popular culture was gendered and experienced differently by 
women and men The study of material objects has also enriched the picture 
of ordinary peoples culture Whether tools and other household objects or 
clothing and personal possessions this attention to the material world has 
helped historians access topics that are not accounted for by written sources
