new goodsto engage in consumer behaviour as economic historians would 
describe it 
Additional factors influencing the nature variety and supply of goods 
over the later medieval and early modern eras are relatively straightforward to 
identify One was commercialisationthe development of trading institutions 
and networks within Europe that facilitated the exchange of commodities 
across space and which gave consumers the power to choose goods which 
were not necessarily produced or cultivated in their own communities Another 
was commerce and colonisation beyond Europe Before the sixteenth century 
the Mediterranean region served as the economic centre of Europe as much 
because of its trade routes into the Levant Arabia and Asia as the productivity 
and creativity of its inhabitants The expansion of Portugal and Spain into the 
Atlantic and Indian Oceans challenged this hegemony by introducing new 
commodities like potatoes tomatoes tobacco and chocolate into European 
diets and using colonial slave labour to increase the supply of traditional 
luxuries like silver sugar and spices These methods of armed commerce 
colonisation and slavery were then adopted by the Dutch French and English 
transforming Europes world of goods in the process They did so not only 
by introducing new comestibles and commodities on a mass scale but also 
by stimulating new practices of production among European manufacturers 
Asian workmanship materials and designfor example in furniture silk and 
porcelainwere copied and reproduced In the meantime inventories from 
the later seventeenth century clearly demonstrate how colonial groceries like 
tobacco coffee tea chocolate and sugar supported a burgeoning and socially 
extensive material culture devoted to their preparation and consumption 
In addition to indigenous developments in production then intensifications 
in both European commerce and global expansion contributed to the increasing 
supply and availability of consumables before the nineteenth century Cities 
and towns were deeply implicated in all these developments serving as centres 
of manufacture and industry as nodes of national and regional commerce 
and as the metropolitan hubs for extraEuropean networks Indeed it is no 
coincidence that the chronology and geography of consumerism in premodern 
Europe closely shadows the history of European urbanisation But cities and 
towns were also of course centres of retail and consumption reminding 
us that changes in the production and supply of goods were only one set of 
factors behind Europes socalled consumer revolutions As important was the 
changingincreasingdemand for goods among different social groups 
It would be a mistake to understand this demand as merely a function 
of supply or the cumulative consequence of consumer decisions based on a 
rational appreciation of availability needs wants and costsalthough these
