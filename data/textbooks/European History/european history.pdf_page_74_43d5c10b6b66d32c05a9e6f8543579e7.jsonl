Italy and Salonica now Thessaloniki Greecenew borders could mean lost 
rights dispossession or forced migration During the peace conference the 
United States United Kingdom and France formally decided which states 
would exist where but border changes were also shaped by local situations 
over which the big three victors had no control Poland which had been 
partitioned out of existence in the eighteenth century returned to the map 
of Europe as a multiethnic state that included Lithuanians Belarussians 
Ukrainians and Germans the German Empire lost AlsaceLorraine in the 
west and parts of Prussia in the east several new states were consciously 
multinational including the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes later 
Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia For better or for worse the Second World 
War fundamentally redrew the map of Europe
Conflicts over borders nevertheless continued between the two World 
Wars especially between Germany and its neighbours Hitlers annexation 
of Austria and of parts of Czechoslovakia in 1938 were but the prelude 
to a larger war in which both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union USSR

a rigid reality as conflict between the USSR and the USA led to the indefinite 
postponement of a final peace treaty In occupied Germany for instance the 
Western and Soviet occupation zones became separate states that competed 
with one another for nearly forty years The Berlin Wall though not built until

across the European subcontinent
Few European borders changed substantially during the Cold War era 
but in 1989 the unexpected collapse of Sovietstyle communism called into 
question both the placement and meaning of borders across Europe While 
much of the postwar order remained intact after 1990 there were several 
momentous changes East and West Germany united the Czech Republic 
and Slovakia divorced the USSR dissolved and Yugoslavia disintegrated 
Thereafter large parts of Europe became more closely integrated within the 
structures of the European Union EU and the Schengen Agreement both of 
which dramatically changed how European borders functioned 
Todays EU was originally founded in 1957 as the European Communities
