and therefore required a strong state to protect it from political interference 
Neoliberal policies entailed restrictions on democratic influence including the 
curtailment of trade unions and the imposition of strict budget limits This 
would be accompanied by an educational sometimes disciplinary programme 
to compel people to become enterprising individualsif not voluntarily then 
by monetary incentive or by punitive measures if necessary
Conclusion
Neoliberalism conquered the world in a perfect ideological storm the 
fragmentation of ideologies after the 1960s was accompanied by the demise of 
the postwar consensus over the values of liberal democracy and the welfare 
state Even more decisive was the collapse of communism in the 1980s resulting 
in the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 At the time this was experienced as another 
end of ideology now that the Soviet Union as the last vestige of communism was 
relegated to the dustbin of history ironically a quotation from Marx himself 
there were no serious contenders outside the ideology of the West and as the 
American political scientist Francis Fukuyama argued this meant the end of 
history Now that ideologies no longer presented programmatic worldviews 
that vied for popular support neoliberalism arguably became ideological in 
the alternative Marxist sense of the term the opaque justification of social 
economic and political power and the hegemonic framework by which people 
misinterpreted their true interests possibilities and expectations It is this 
legacy of what could be termed the Age of Ideologies that laid the foundations 
for global order in the twentyfirst century
