Gamal Abdel Nasser 19181970 to nationalise the Suez Canal went against 
treaties imposed in the nineteenth century by Britain and France Nassers 
plan was met with ridicule He was portrayed as couscous Mussolini by the 
Western press But he also sparked fears that his plan could jeopardise a most 
important route that brought Middle Eastern oil to the west Ultimately the 
crisis marked the end of AngloFrench dominance in the region with Egypt 
managing to meet its ends with the support of the United States and the Soviet 
Union which together emerged as the new dominant powers in the region
A second event that merits attention here is the 1973 oil crisis triggered 
when the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries OAPEC 
halted oil exports to the United States and the Netherlands in an attempt to 
negate Western and European support to Israel during the Arab Israeli War 
of the same year The resulting paralysis impacted gravely on the Western 
economies of the time It demonstrated that Middle Eastern countries had 
become existential sources of political and economic vigour and stability in 
Europe not to mention its postwar recovery Establishing cordial relations

the Middle East was not simply Europes other All of its problems past and 
present have been byproducts of the complex strategic and economic relations 
between Western European empires and the regions local inhabitants Even 
to this day the issues of the Middle East are seen in European popular culture 
through a myopic lens which obscures these entangled imperial histories and 
eclipses the fact that the tragedies of the region are also products of global 
connections
Asia
European images of Asia have changed dramatically over time In the nineteenth 
century representations of China for example shifted from a civilised Europe 
of the East to an ancient country without history or even to an evil yellow 
peril As Europes other Asia provided mirror images that helped foster 
a sense of European identity The Asian present has appeared both as an 
envisioned European future and as a perceived European past as a symbol 
of progressiveness or backwardness Similarly twentiethcentury images of 
Asia were represented in temporal metaphors that posited Europe as Asias
