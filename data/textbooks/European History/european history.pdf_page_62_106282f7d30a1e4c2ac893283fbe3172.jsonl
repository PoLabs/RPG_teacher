Then in the eighteenth century the concept of sovereignty underwent 
major changes A growing national consciousness on the part of state subjects 
was paralleled by the growing power and ambition of their rulers who made 
use of professional armies and military equipment These were all steps in 
the direction of the nationstate a more coherent entity defined within clear 
political borders
Enlightened absolutism was practiced by eighteenthcentury sovereigns 
who aspired to supreme authority within their domains while at the same 
time drawing inspiration from the intellectual premises of the Enlightenment 
for their rule Absolute monarchs directed statebuilding measures towards 
the creation of a national community breaking down privileges and vested 
interests in favour of notions of citizenship and patriotism including previously 
maintained regional autonomies France was Europes pioneer state in 
combining mental maps and foreign policy claiming natural borders such as 
the Pyrenees the Rhine and the Alps as part of its own territory Borders were 
again central to the process of defining a given nation visvis its neighbours 
but now they were also a vehicle for the emergent patriotic sentiment These 
new national borders gradually superseded the confessional ones of the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Thus by the eighteenth century several 
European states again consisted of territories with different religions and 
confessions Confessionally homogenous territories were a phenomenon 
limited to the decades of religious wars in the preceding centuries
French rulers of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were not only 
pioneers in combining mental maps with foreign policy They were also at the 
forefront of establishing control over the movement of population From the 
seventeenth century the French kings subjects needed a passport to leave the 
country In the eighteenth century a passport was also required for foreigners 
travelling to France Unsurprisingly this passport and border system of the 
ancien rgime was considered part of the tyranny of the French monarchy and 
was abolished soon after 1789 However following a very brief liberal period 
the system was swiftly reintroduced in the following decade for security 
reasons even though the 1791 constitution granted free permission to leave 
the country
In other regions of Europe governments attempted to consolidate state 
borders For Habsburgian territories at the southeast edge of the continent this 
meant abolishing the frontier zone with the Ottoman Empire After signing the 
peace treaty of Carlowitz in 1699 the Austrian government sought to establish 
a clear line of demarcation to separate Austrian and Hungarian territories from 
Ottoman lands These efforts were undertaken to avoid double taxation in 
border regions and to reduce border violations from the Ottoman side While 
this process was quite successfully implemented by the Austrian authorities
