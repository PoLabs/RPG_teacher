declined relatively rapidly Those who had already survived into adulthood 
now also had better life prospects Meanwhile the economic boom in the 
second half of the century created a favourable opportunity for agricultural 
areas in Eastern Europe Increases in production also brought positive changes 
in the distribution of food as steam hauling revolutionised transportation 
An improvement in living conditions was brought about by a more balanced 
diet and increasing knowledge of preventive medicine However these 
improvements in living standards were fragile and progressed in leaps and 
bounds amid setbacks related to agricultural crises and outbreaks of infectious 
disease
The trend in fertility is more complex than the trend in mortality 
Demographic transition theory does not consider regional variations However 
throughout the nineteenth century the total fertility rate the average number 
of children born to women aged between fifteen and fortynine varied 
significantly between different parts of the continent Central European 
values for example remained below Eastern European values throughout the 
century but were higher than those of Western Europe The decline in fertility 
in Western European states began as early as the 1870s and 1880s while in 
Central Europe the same trend started around 1900 Yet territorial differences 
cannot simply be explained by the westeast slope of economic and cultural 
processes 
On both sides of the divide we can see much more differentiated processes 
The fertility transition started first in antitraditionalist revolutionary 
countries and was thereafter widely adopted across Europe reaching 
traditionalist religious countries last In Hungary for example the decline in 
fertility started almost at the same time as in Western Europeeven before the 
decrease in mortality in Hungary It was somewhat later than France and the 
US the pioneers in the fertility transition but much earlier than religiously 
conservative countries like the Netherlands where fertility decreased rather 
slowly and remained relatively high well into the twentieth century The 
varied timing of fertility decline across Europe is at odds with demographic 
transition theory demonstrating that the mechanisms underlying demographic 
modernisation differed across the continent 
The issue becomes even more complicated when we look at differences 
within countries Research has shown conscious and significant birth control 
in some regions since the end of the eighteenth century If we stay with 
the Hungarian example the onechild system of the Ormnsg in South 
Transdanubia is clearly such a phenomenonSocial stratification and rural
urban differences were probably a more important indicator for the fall of 
birth rates than the country of origin In urban contexts the upper and middle
