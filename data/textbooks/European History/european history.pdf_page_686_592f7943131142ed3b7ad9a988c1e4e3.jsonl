induction of Balkan Christian children into the Ottoman state institutions 
especially the administration and the elite Janissary corps
European expansion from the eleventh century onwards also made use of 
slave labour While there were strong continuities with late antiquity the 
Crusades gave Christian proprietors the opportunity to construct a partially 
slavepowered overseas plantation economy oriented around cotton rice 
and sugar cane At first located mainly in the Eastern Mediterranean the 
systematic use and subsequent importation of slaves on a large scale to toil in 
overseas mines and plantations was eventually employed across the Atlantic 
from the fifteenth century onwards
The discovery of the Americas and the sea route to the Indian Ocean 
gave rise to European colonialism which became a major driving force in 
the diffusion and growth of the triangular slave trade between Africa the 
Americas and Europe Between 1519 and 1867 around twelve to thirteen 
million enslaved Africans were sold to Portuguese British French Dutch and 
Spanish merchants and forcibly relocated across the Atlantic Competition 
among West African states was at the root of the Atlantic slave trade which 
was fuelled by the exchange of slaves for European weapons and goods 
This dynamic led to a vicious cycle with severe longterm consequences for 
economic development
As elsewhere slavery in the Americas was dreadful with the overwhelming 
majority of enslaved people ending up on Caribbean and South American 
plantations and mines owned by Western European proprietors and investors 
especially from the midseventeenth century onwards Slaves were used to 
produce export commodities such as cotton or sugar molasses to be consumed 
by highearning wage labourers in Northwestern Europe These dynamics 
paved the way for the eventual emergence of a second triangular trade that 
saw European manufactured goods such as textiles exported to Africa and the 
Americas in exchange for slaves and plantation products respectively 
Proprietors investors and craftsmen also employed other means to secure 
inexpensive labour The two most important categories were indentured 
servitude contractbased work without pay for a specified period of time 
which included apprenticeships and convict labour Indentured workers 
could be transferred from one employer to another and these migrant workers 
constituted a sizeable part of the original population of Britains colonies in 
North America While indentured servitude and debt bondage were intimately 
related prisoners of war and convicts were also often shipped overseas
In warfare prisoners and convicts were also used as forced labour with 
impressment forced military service a subset of these categories From the 
eighteenth century onwards capital punishment was gradually replaced by 
chain gangs and in more recent times convict leasing
