Opera and Classical Music
In the field of nineteenthcentury music if we consider the break with and the 
reinterpretation of traditions the renewal of the forms of expression and the 
appearance of artistic freedomthat is to say if our topic is manifestations 
of the avantgarde attitudethen we have to refer first and foremost to the 
German composer Richard Wagner 18131883 Wagner renewed the operatic 
genre that was dominated by the popular Italian composers of his time above 
all Giuseppe Verdi 18131901 Wagners concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk a 
total artwork attempted to free art from commercialisationthe process 
in which pieces of art became consumer goods In accordance with the 
ancient Greek idea of art Wagner advocated for pure autonomous art whose 
branches are united and not hermetically separated from each other This 
understanding was manifested in his notion of Musikdramaas he named his 
mature works instead of using the standard denomination of opera The four
opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen The Ring of the Nibelung premiered as 
a whole in 1876 was outstanding even among his own work Wagners radical 
innovation in the composition of this tetralogy was the merging of different 
branches of art striving to create a Gesamtkunstwerk in which music text and 
visuality were fused He was one of the few composers who wrote both the 
music and the libretto script for his operas and oversaw the visuality and 
the conceptual details of the stage design His vision even extended to the 
architecture of opera houses Wagner planned and implemented a venue for 
his own artworks the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth with many unique features 
designed specifically for his operas such as a hidden orchestra pit Like many 
artists of the time Wagner aimed to show the inner life and inherent nature 
of the human being in all of his works Besides the revelation of personal 
psychology Wagner also tried to confront societys inner mechanisms and 
the driving forces that work below the surface He expressed the above
mentioned ideas in the framework of narrative through the use of slowly 
developing musical themes In his music dramas Wagner introduced the 
Leitmotif a recurring short musical phrase referring to characters dramatic 
situations or cultic objects In terms of music the other highly avantgarde 
means of expression was atonality which he experimented with first in 
Tristan und Isolde 1865 Wagners musical innovations influenced many 
modern composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky while his 
aesthetics had an important influence beyond the sphere of music inspiring 
writers such as Charles Baudelaire Stphane Mallarm Thomas Mann or 
Friedrich Nietzsche
