44 UNDERSTANDING AND CONTROLLING THE ENVIRONMENT

management in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with the aim of 
maximising yields and profits Based on scientific criteria forest planners 
created monocultures and planted trees in rows separated by corridors thus 
making forests manageable Transport of the wood to distant markets made 
use of a timber rafting infrastructure While this rational approach limited 
deforestation of the continent to a certain extent it also prevented traditional 
cooperative agricultural uses of forests for the provision of winter fodder 
tillage and forest grazing and transformed large areas of European woodlands 
into private plantations 
Expanding markets and longdistance trade sparked a largescale 
commodification of nature and induced significant changes in landuse 
patterns European entrepreneurs were involved in land reclamation in north
western Europe the English Fens the Dutch polders and the Mediterranean 
the Venetian Lagoon and also explored new opportunities overseas With 
improving sea transportation they became able to develop plantation 
economies in tropical regions including attempts at timber production Species 
imported from the New World altered the traditional diet of Europeans and 
due to their resistance to local pests provided a reliable source of calories 
The ensuing complex Columbian Exchange characterised by a mixing of 
the hitherto largely separated biological life of the American African and 
Eurasian continents marked a distinctive step towards the development of a 
global agricultural market 
An additional push towards change in traditional practices of nature 
management in Europe came from the natural world itself The period of 
climate cooling known as the Little Ice Age characterised by harsh and 
freezing winters brought about significant changes in agricultural production 
Viticulture disappeared from some of the less favourable regions and in 
northern Europe grains were partly replaced by the cultivation of the more 
coldresistant potatoes While only a small group of Europeans engaged in 
resource exploitation associated with longdistance trade many farmers 
peasants and fishermen had to cope with often fundamental changes in their 
agrarian ecosystems caused by natural factors 
Coping with Risks
As suggested by the impact of the Little Ice Age the environment of early 
modern Europe could pose risks to human lives and livelihoods just as well as 
it could provide essential resources Although these risks often originated in 
natural phenomena such as the weather storms floods or droughts seismic 
activity earthquakes volcanic eruptions or biological incidents epidemics 
their ultimate impact depended on the interaction between man and the 
environment In fact many risks were caused or at least exacerbated by
