Compared to the age of Reformation the Enlightenment developed a more 
positive view of childhood In his book Some Thoughts Concerning Education 
1693 the English philosopher John Locke 16321704 viewed the child as a 
tabula rasa which should be inscribed with empirical and physical experiences 
and guided by strict but tender educators In a more radical way the Genevese 
writer JeanJacques Rousseau 17121778 in his mile ou De lducation 
1762 prompted the ideal of natural education grounded in the childs own 
exploration of their rural environment What these Enlightenment voices 
share is a plea for an educational style that encouraged children to learn on 
the basis of their own observations and curiosity This plea should be viewed 
against the backdrop of the optimistic Enlightened conviction that society 
could be engineered and that mankind as such would improve when new 
generations were granted a pathway to intellectual and moral progress In the 
second half of the eighteenth century teachers authors and publishers helped 
to realise this Enlightenment programme by developing new types of schools 
and innovative childrens books that stimulated young readers to interact

defined by its transnational character for instance bestselling childrens 
books written by German philanthropists like Joachim Heinrich Campe 
17461818 and Christian Felix Weisse 17261804 were widely translated 
throughout western and northern Europe The commercial character of the 
market is similarly striking the Little Pretty PocketBook 1744 by the English 
publisher John Newbery 17131767 for example came with a ball for 
boys and a pincushion for girls to attract young consumers This example 
clearly illustrates that childrenas well as their parentswere being taken 
seriously as a commercial group with its own desires and needs The creation 
of childtargeted books and toys demonstrates that children were increasingly 
granted their own life and a distinctive childrens culture characterised by 
cheerfulness and a carefree atmosphere While they were thus taken more and 
more seriously as a social group with its own identity however they also 
became even more excluded from the real world In short they experienced a 
process of both emancipation and exclusion during the early modern period
Youth Cultures 
Although adolescence has long been perceived as a modern invention 
historians nowadays assume that early modern people also gradually 
developed into adults by means of moral and social transformations and 
as such went through a period of youth that was expected to end at the
