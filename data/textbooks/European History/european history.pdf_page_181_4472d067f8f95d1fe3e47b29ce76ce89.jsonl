21 DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE

in 1970 In Western countries the onset of this transition was longer and more 
gradual For the countries behind the Iron Curtain the process was delayed but 
then became much more dynamic during the 1990s Contrary to the Western 
experience the 1970s and 1980s were the years of rising fertility in the East 
though increases were very moderate While the West started to be confronted 
with the crisis of the welfare state during the economic stagflation of the 1970s 
communist regimes promoted a sort of family welfare that enabled citizens to 
marry at a quite young age The example of Czechoslovakia is instructive in 
this respect The countrys very generous pronatalist policy pushed birth rates 
back up above the replacement rate 21 children per woman in the 1970s 
However this lasted only for a rather short period of time In 1970 the fertility 
rate was only at the level of 192 children per woman Four years later it was 
at 244 After that however the sources of growthmassive investments in 
housing and various forms of child allowance as well as numerous cohorts of 
mothers born during the postwar baby boomwere depleted and fertility 
fell below the replacement rate from 1980 onwards 
The turn of the 1980s and 1990s profoundly changed the circumstances 
of everyday life in the East The three pillars of the social welfare system of 
Central and Eastern Europe which guaranteed employment social protection 
and stable price levels ceased to exist The shock caused by this change 
triggered a transformational crisis after 1990 Fertility continued to fall On the 
other hand the improvement in mortality rates changed rapidly in Slovenia 
Poland and the Czech Republic and somewhat more slowly in Hungary and 
the Soviet successor states Health improvements can only be considered 
stratumspecific due to the affordability of modern treatments diagnostics 
medication and so on
At the same time migratory pressures had increased the previous 
restrictions had been lifted and an eastwest migration began towards 
the states of Europe with a better standard of living The wave of political 
refugees that had accompanied the twentieth century was also transformed in 
several stages during the final decades of the century 1980s refugees arriving 
from communist states were replaced in the 1990s by those arriving from the 
disintegrating Yugoslavia then at the turn of the millennium by those coming 
from crisis zones outside of Europe 
Conclusion
The delayed start of the first demographic transition outside of Europe see 
previous chapter and its earlier completion in Europe than anywhere else
in the form of low death rates as well as low birth ratescaused a dynamic 
decline in the European share of the total human population In 1900 one
