rapid rise in inequality not only in Europe but on the global stage in the last 
decades of the twentieth century Economist and historian Thomas Piketty 
articulates a third interpretationhe emphasises the role of the two World 
Wars as great levellers which incited significant constriction of wealth 
disparities However he continues wars and other shocks could hardly 
guarantee singlehandedly the narrowing of gaps in wealth What is needed 
to level gaps is a particular social and political configuration in which the 
masses of ordinary people have strong leverage and a voice in the articulation 
of the response to a shock European industrial societies could indeed serve as 
a primary example of such configurations
Trends in Inequality
Generally twentiethcentury Europe witnessed a process sometimes labelled 
the great levelling in the rich world Almost without exception European 
countries experienced massive reductions in income inequality as social 
democratic policies characterised by higher taxes on the wealthy progressive 
taxation and redistributive programmespolicies associated with the 
welfare statebecame almost universally accepted Initially this trend 
was attributed to the economic cycle of liberal capitalism associated with 
the processes of industrialisation which first led to concentration of wealth 
in the hands of economic elites in the nineteenth century followed by the 
growing participation of emergent middle classes in the distribution of wealth 
thereafter Nonetheless recent studies propose less deterministic perspectives 
pointing out the crucial effect that the Great Depression and the two World 
Wars cast on wealth distribution trends Furthermore the narrowing of the 
income gap has not always been followed by a corresponding trend in wealth 
inequality some countries such as the Netherlands showed relatively low
income inequality while preserving considerable wealth inequality Gini 
coefficient of 029 vs 089 as of 2016with zero meaning perfect equality and 
one absolute inequality While there is a clear connection between the two
since income from property in the end contributes to income inequalityit 
would be shortsighted to focus simply on the former 
While the general trend holds over the entire European continent the 
situations in particular countries show significant variation For instance 
Sweden departs from the model by recording a continual decline in the income 
gap between 1890 and 1980 while most European countries experienced a 
shortterm reversal directly before the First World War and then again in the 
relatively prosperous 1920s up until the arrival of the Great Depression By 
comparison in Francoist Spain inequality remained relatively stable with a 
Gini coefficient of 035 in 1910 1950 and 1970 The regimes in communist
