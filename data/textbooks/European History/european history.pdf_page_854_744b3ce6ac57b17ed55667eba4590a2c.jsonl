Avantgarde artists according to the critic Clement Greenberg saw it as 
their primary mission to push artistic and aesthetic boundaries They did this 
by narrowing and raising art to the expression of an absolute in which all 
relativities and contradictions would be either resolved or beside the point 
The results of this continuous narrowing of the meaning of art were the birth of 
the concept of lart pour lart art for arts sake and ultimately abstraction In 
fine arts the path toward abstraction led through realism and impressionism 
The French painter Gustave Courbet 18191877 who took an active part in 
the Commune and acted as the President of the Federation of Artists argued 
that realism is essentially democratic art He believed that the unvarnished 
presentation of the existence of workers and peasants could truly help in their 
struggle for social advancement From an aesthetic point of view his paintings 
can be termed realist since he not only endeavoured to record the nature and 
the life of workers with visual fidelity but also abandoned composition thus 
the accentuation of any detail
Despite the longlasting impact of the socially committed art of Courbet 
succeeding generations of the French avantgarde were rather receptive only 
toward the aesthetic legacy of realism From the 1860s until the beginning 
of the following century progressive painters and sculptors were decisively 
apolitical and regarded autonomy as their essential principle besides 
progression Historically the last four decades of the nineteenth century seem 
like a course toward abstraction that can be thought of as a purification process 
toward pure art in other words the gradual attrition of content visvis 
expression Around 1860 paintings and sculptures were unanimously lifelike 
figurative and meaningbearing That is to say artworks a represented visual 
forms that people could similarly identify as objects taken from their familiar 
environment lifeworld and b bore meaning that referred also to the very 
lifeworld in which they were at home 
That consensual understanding of visual art was first broken by the French 
painter douard Manet 18321883 whose paintings The Luncheon on the Grass 
and Olympia both 1863 were rejected by the official Salon They caused scandal 
not because of their sexual overtones but because they depicted nonsense in the 
eyes the Parisian public who could not place them in the traditional context of 
artistic interpretation Even though Manet painted with almost photographic 
precision he can be considered as one of the most important forerunners 
of abstraction since his works did not seem to express an obvious meaning 
beyond their formal aspects of forms colours light and composition This is 
why he is regarded as the first representative of lart pour lart While Manet 
abandoned concrete meaning from his paintings the impressionists gave up 
the principle of realistic depiction Impressionists named after Impression
