Later this inadequacy also included the inhabitants of other continents as 
observations of strange customs and behaviours by people from overseas 
nations made Europeans more attentive to their own notions of normalcy
The notion of mutual proximity and distinctiveness from the rest of the world 
based primarily on the shared Christian religion and the notion of civilisation 
as opposed to barbarism or paganism had existed among the inhabitants of 
the Old Continent since antiquity and the Middle Agesand was borne out 
above all during the Crusades 10951492 and later through the pressure of 
the Ottoman expansion 14531566 But from the fifteenth century onwards 
these sentiments significantly grew as a result of European expansion into 
other continents leading to encounters with different races and different 
social and cultural formations In a defensive reaction to a sudden widening of 
horizons an intensive process of selffashioning took place that is not easy to 
tie to a particular time or place This process of selffashioningof establishing 
the imagined community of Europeran parallel to the formation of specific 
national identities over the same period Even though the term Europe was 
rarely used in sources before the eighteenth century notions of superiority 
and distinctiveness had appeared and were shared by the intellectual and 
social elites more specifically male elites of various European countries 
As for the idea of a political order the rise of the idea that the Habsburg 
Empire acted as a part which stands in for Europe as a whole is exemplified 
by Europa Eidyllion a pastoral poem in Latin written in 1558 by Johann 
Lauterbach 15311593 in which a personified Europa represents the 
Habsburg Universal Monarchy Such dynastic monarchies as the Habsburg 
Empire referenced a supranational political order The Peace of Westphalia 
of 1648 was a crucial moment in which the powers of Europe were tied more 
closely into a transnational order in which the balance of power was played 
out on a field conceived as Europe Crises in maintaining that balance such as 
the Spanish 17011714 Polish 17331738 and Austrian Wars of Succession 
17401748 and the Great Northern War 17001721 advanced the idea of 
Europe as a complex political system a theatre of war constituting a political 
world in its own right 
When it comes to religioneven in such regions as the Holy Roman Empire 
Poland or Hungary that were notorious arenas of confessional strugglethe 
complexity of the European political world did not eliminate the prospect of a 
Christian Europe a community of the chosen transcending doctrinal division 
In fact the notion of Europe overlapped with the concepts of a Respublica 
Christiana or Mundus Christianusthe idea originating in the work The City 
of God by Augustine of Hippo 354430 a father of the church that there is 
a spiritual Commonwealth of Christians This Commonwealth of Christians 
was visualised as a unity of all true believers subordinate to divine law and 
superseding political divisions within the European community The concept
