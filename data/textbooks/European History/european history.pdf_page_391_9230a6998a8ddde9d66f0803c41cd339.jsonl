34 PEACE AND CONFLICT

she would have been utterly astonished Perhaps most significantly the size 
of armies increased dramatically across this period During the Thirty Years 
War the average size of an army in battle was 19000 by the Napoleonic Wars 
a century and a half later the average size had nearly quadrupled to 84000 
The resources required to coordinate and administer such large and complex 
movements of troops contributed to the consolidation of the modern state as a 
powerful institution that centralised its political power The sixteenthcentury 
Protestant Reformation added a new religious dimension to conflicts both 
within and between European states reaching its nadir in the bloodiest conflict 
of the period the Thirty Years War In the sixteenth century France fought the 
Habsburgs of Spain and Austria for continental hegemony but had to contend 
with rising Dutch and Swedish power in the seventeenth century By the mid
eighteenth century Frances military power had been decisively checked by 
a more powerful Great Britain and Prussia While European conflicts already 
had a global dimension in the sixteenth century transoceanic connections 
intensified especially in the eighteenth century meaning that developments 
in colonies far from the European continent could directly impact conflicts 
internal to Europe at an unprecedented scale by the outbreak of the Seven 
Years War of the mideighteenth century Not only did warfare change but so 
too did practices of establishing and maintaining peace Arguably the most 
significant development in this regard was the establishment of permanent 
diplomatic representation between states and the rise of the idea of a balance 
of power that states should be committed to maintaining The eighteenth
century Enlightenment saw the birth of both the perspective that war should 
be made more humane since it cannot be avoided and the perspective that 
perpetual peace is a real possibility as in Immanuel Kants famous 1795 tract 
two views that continue to underpin debates about war and peace in the 
twentyfirst century
