Central and Eastern Europe Such an impression is not completely erroneous 
as indeed Central and Eastern Europe marked a region of the continent 
where several empires met and chafed at the edges Imperial borderlands 
are usually much more ethnically complex However what a demographic 
map hides is the complex reality of ethnicity throughout west and east Well 
into the nineteenth century groups that might otherwise be represented as 
compact the Germans the French the Italians did not in practice represent 
one single ethnicity but rather myriads of regional dialects local cultures and 
worldviews sometimes mutually unintelligible and foreign to one another 
This subchapter is going to investigate European patterns of interethnic 
experiences and state policies The first section will concentrate on the 
ways ethnic groups were viewed in the emerging modern nationstates of 
nineteenthcentury Europe focusing on the links between statebuilding and 
homogenisation efforts as well as on the relationship between majority and 
minority groups The second section will explore multiethnicity and multi
national empires in Central and Eastern Europe concentrating on the Habsburg 
Monarchy as a paradigmatic example The Jewish case will be presented in a 
separate section as a special category of minority experiences 
The Emergence of Modern Nationstates and the Changing 
Position of Ethnic Minorities in the Nationstate Paradigm
By the end of the early modern period the common use of one dominant 
language had become the norm in several European monarchies Although 
not all nineteenthcentury states strove to achieve language homogenisation 
most of them worked toward the marginalisation of minority languages in one 
way or another and strove to curtail the autonomy of historic minorities In 
France a country which served as a model for many emerging nationstates of 
nineteenthcentury Europe the centralisation of state power had progressed 
handinhand with policies of language homogenisation since the early 
modern period The 1539 Ordinance of VillersCotterts declared that French 
should be used exclusively in state administration and legal documents as 
the only official language of the country The French Revolution continued 
this tendency linguistic diversity was interpreted as a risk to national unity 
so the official use of regional languages such as Occitan in the south Celtic
influenced Breton in the north and Basque near the FrenchSpanish border 
was suppressed together with the local autonomies and ancient legal privileges 
of historic regions which were all integrated into the uniform system of 
dpartements With the emergence of nationalism and the ideal of the nation
state in nineteenthcentury Europe efforts in favour of cultural homogenisation 
became pronounced in several other European states as well Education was
