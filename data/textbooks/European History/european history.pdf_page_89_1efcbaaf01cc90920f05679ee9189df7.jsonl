of the Iberian Peninsula by Christian kings In terms of numbers and their 
significance the expulsion of this group from the Iberian Peninsula and 
the resulting diaspora are of great importance Very numerous in Valencia 
and Aragon but also in Castile and Andalusia the Moriscos were a highly 
heterogeneous group whose relationship with the old Christians was complex 
and not easily reducible to a binary opposition However between the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries the Moriscos suffered a double expulsion After 
the socalled Rebellion of Granada 15691571 they were forced to leave 
the Kingdom of Granada to be exiled to the territories of western Andalusia 
and Castile Then due to fears that the Moriscos were conspiring with the 
Ottomans against the King of Spain and his Christian subjects but mostly 
for political reasons King Philip III r 15981621 ordered their definitive 
expulsion in 1609 about 300000 Moriscos were forced to leave their lands 
and workshops While those who wanted to take their children under the age 
of seven were forced to go to Christian countries disembarking in Marseille 
and Livorno the majority went to North Africa Morocco Algiers and Tunisia 
where local rulers like Uthman Dey of Tunisia were eager for the trades 
techniques and knowledge which the Moriscos brought with them and to 
the eastern Mediterranean mainly to Istanbul The transition was not always 
smooth even for those who as Muslims shared the faith of their new host 
societies but while many were subject to further exclusion abuse and assault 
most were eventually absorbed into the local societies
Migration and War Christian Europe and the Ottoman 
Empire
As we have seen migration in the early modern period often originated in the 
displacement of the adherents of particular creeds as a result of the repressive 
and exclusionist religious policies of European rulers as well as the efforts of 
majority communities to rid themselves of the presence of religious minorities 
in their midst Another major cause for migration in the early modern period 
was military conflict This is particularly true for multiethnic EastCentral and 
SouthEastern Europe In these regions the expansion and later withdrawal 
of the Ottoman Empire led to largescale processes of migration which were 
continuous from the sixteenth century to the mideighteenth century even if 
they varied considerably in terms of intensity direction and type over the 
course of the period
The Ottoman armys move westward on the European continent where it 
had controlled territory since the fourteenth century created large numbers 
of refugees Moldavian Romanians and different Cossack and Tartar tribes 
displaced by Ottoman expansion settled in the eastern border regions of Poland
