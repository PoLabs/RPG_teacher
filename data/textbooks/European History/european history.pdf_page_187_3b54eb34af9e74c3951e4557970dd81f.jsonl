Modern History ca 15001800
Benjamin Conrad Tobias P Graf and Arndt Wille
Introduction
Contrary to nationalist narratives which generally postulated ethnic 
homogeneity within the boundaries of given nationstates early modern 
Europe was ethnically diverse This is most obvious in the case of territorially 
extensive polities such as the Habsburg and Ottoman realms which are 
commonly referred to as multiethnic empires However significant ethnic 
diversity existed even in much smaller spaces This makes twentieth and 
twentyfirst century conceptualisations of nationality as inadequate for 
understanding early modern ethnic relations as the concept of borders see 
Chapter 12 When people in this period spoke about Germans for instance 
they meant not just the inhabitants of what we might think of today as the 
Germanspeaking lands Germany Austria and parts of Switzerland 
but also populations living in PolandLithuania Silesia Bohemia Croatia 
Transylvania and the Baltic These demographics were not necessarily the 
result of recent migrations but had existed for a significant period of time 
While a combination of language and descent were important for contemporary 
understandings of ethnic belonging other elements such as religion played an 
equally important role 
In a first step this chapter discusses early modern conceptions of ethnic 
difference before investigating ethnic coexistence and conflict in Europe 
through the example of PolandLithuania It then turns to a discussion of 
the status and treatment of Jews and the Romani people often referred to as 
gypsies at the hands of majority populations The final section explores the 
place of European indigenous peoples such as the Sami of Scandinavia
