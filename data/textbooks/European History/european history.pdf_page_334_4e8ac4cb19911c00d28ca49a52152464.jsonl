it was fed by a racial thinking and pseudoscientific racism that developed 
steadily in this period Religious ideas on race aligned with this form of racial 
thinking and manifested among other things in a shift from monogenism 
which posited that all humans descended from common ancestors namely 
Adam and Eve to polygenism which argued that different categories 
of people had different ancestors which many have argued led to harder 
attitudes towards race
Attitudes towards race were one factor that fed into the exoticisation of the 
nonEuropean other in this period Exoticism was closely linked with eroticism 
and images of scantily clad indigenous women fed into understandings about 
empire across Europe demonstrating the links between ideas about race and 
ideas about sexuality
Imperial ideology was not uncontested in this period and during the 
nineteenth century there were also considerable acts of anticolonial 
resistance Antislavery rebellions such as the socalled Christmas Rebellion 
of 1831 in Jamaica had contributed to the end of slavery in the first half of the 
nineteenth century Perhaps one of the most notable acts of imperial resistance 
was the Indian Rebellion then called a Mutiny which broke out in Meerut in 
1857 Across the Indian subcontinent there were subsequent protests against 
a range of conditions including the introduction of the Enfield rifle which in 
requiring soldiers to bite the end of a cartridge rumoured to contain beef and 
pork fat violated Hindu and Muslim religious practices increased seizures 
of indigenous land and perceived Christianisation and Westernisation The 
revolt was brutally put down by the British and many Indian people were 
killed The shock that the Indian Rebellion generated back in the British 
metropole was extraordinary and led to an explosion of novels plays and 
poems demonising the rebels and in particular the slaughter of European 
women and children Many of the ideas that took hold in this period continued 
to shape the imperial imagination for the remainder of the century 
Conclusion
The central premise of this chapter is that nineteenthcentury imperialism 
and colonialism can be distinguished from its early modern predecessors 
and postcolonial successors Among the specific features that set this phase 
of European imperialism and colonialism apart a few can be highlighted the 
fact of the formal incorporation of territories in a relatively small number of 
empires more systematic economic exploitation than before a ruling ideology 
that was strongly marked by ideas about race gender and civilisation 
defined through religion but also scientific and technological advancement
