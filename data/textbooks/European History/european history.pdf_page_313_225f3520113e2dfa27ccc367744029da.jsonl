31 STATEBUILDING AND NATIONALISM
293
the assumption that rights cannot be separated from state power The political 
influence held by various diaspora communities around the world adds to this 
decline in the central status of the nationstate
Conclusion
Over the last two centuries European societies have been organised and 
shaped by national ideas During the twentieth century the concept of the 
nationstate nationalism and minorities associated with this idea underwent 
significant changes The disappearance of nationalism and the nationstate 
had been predicted in the 1990s but it is now certain that this will not happen 
and we can observe opposite trends Today we are seeing a radical revision 
of neoliberal doctrines about the state which could foreshadow a new kind of 
statebuilding In the age of globalisation the nationstate is an alternative for 
many to experience their own national or ethnic identity
During the twentieth century we have witnessed the development of 
a system of human rights with the result that fewer and fewer rights are 
linked exclusively to citizenship Many former nationstates have become 
multicultural states The concept of citizenship has changed greatly mainly 
due to the challenges of globalisation technological development and 
migration so in the future belonging to a political nation should not be linked 
to citizenship
European states have pursued ethnic and paternalistic policies throughout 
their twentiethcentury history Some varieties of ethnonationalism are still 
present in European political life becoming a tool of manipulating political 
elites in several countries Another phenomenon is that certain peoples are 
stepping out of the nationstate framework to try to define their national 
identity in the name of a reborn European regionalism
In the postmodern age nationalism intensified in many societies in Central 
and Eastern Europe while Western and Northern Europe sought to integrate 
the nonEuropean immigrant masses and eliminate political extremism
