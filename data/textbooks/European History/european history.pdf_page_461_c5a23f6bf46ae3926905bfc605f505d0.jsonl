Introduction
The period between the French Revolution 17891799 and the outbreak of 
the First World War 19141918 was marked by the unforeseen dynamism 
of research and technology by the formation of the independent academic 
disciplines that we know today including biology chemistry history philology 
and the first social sciences and also by a growing gap between the sciences 
sciences Naturwissenschaften and the humanities lettres Geisteswissenschaften 
It was also a period in which technology radically transformed the production 
of goods and came to shape the everyday lives of a growing number of people 
in Europe and across the world increasing human interconnectedness While 
the relationship between science and technology has always been far from 
straightforward the long nineteenth century was characterised by growing 
efforts to organise and institutionalise the links between the two particularly 
under the logic of utility and profit but also with the aim to expand human 
knowledge in fields such as astronomy Moreover this period witnessed the 
professionalisation of scientific pursuits due to the broadening field of state 
intervention and the growing investment of governing elites in science and 
technology more and more peoplemostly but not exclusively mencould 
earn their livelihoods doing science While science and technology were 
presented and understood as universal they were shaped by existing relations 
of power and their imbalances which were particularly pronounced in the 
era of the Great Divergence the socioeconomic shift during the nineteenth 
century in which the Western sphere emerged as the wealthiest civilisation 
eclipsing the rest of the world European powers used technology and science
