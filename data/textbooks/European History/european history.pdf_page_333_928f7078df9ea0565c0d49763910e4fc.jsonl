32 EMPIRE AND COLONIALISM

normative civilisation and discursively degrading the nonEuropean rest 
of the world For example if they did not participate directly in physically 
dominating and exploiting overseas regions they could participate indirectly 
in the colonising thrust through acquisition description and categorisation of 
objects brought from afar Presentday museums are inheritors of this ethos 
and are still endowed with the authority to affirm what is historically and 
culturally significant
Specific forms of such colonial complicity can be studied in Central and 
Eastern Europe region that had often experienced external political as well 
as economic and cultural pressures from their immediate neighbours Russia 
PrussiaGermany AustroHungary and the Ottoman Empire Faced with these 
pressures the inhabitants of the region were developing a sense of belonging 
to the whole of Europe as a geographical political and cultural category But 
there were also specific discursive strategies and reference points that explicitly 
opposed Central and Eastern European reality to Western European colonial 
empires thus breaking the clearcut dichotomy of European coloniser and 
nonEuropean colonised
The entanglements of these various imperial fantasies and real efforts for 
political and economic dominance have been shown for example by Lenny 
Urea Valerio in her study of the construction of Polishness in Polish lands 
under German imperial domination during the period when Poland ceased to 
exist as a state its territory being partitioned between Germany Austria and 
Russia She shows how Polishness was constructed in identification with 
the colonial other in Africa and South America also facing quasicolonial 
penetrations of the German state and German settlers
The symbolic appropriation of faraway regions also found support in the 
new medium for knowing the world photographya technological invention 
that was also claimed to show the superiority of Europe over the rest of the 
world It apparently offered an objective truthful depiction of a strange 
reality but at the same time testified to its otherness
Gender also became an important area of intervention in terms of cultural 
imperialism As Gayatri Spivak famously put it white men saving brown 
women from brown men was a recurring colonial trope in this period 
Dating back to the Enlightenment the status of women was seen as a marker 
of civilisation Indigenous women were thought to need saving from a 
range of fates including sati the Hindu practice of burning widows on the 
deceased husbands funeral pyre childmarriage polygamy and bride
wealth payments
Racial thinking too shaped the discourse and praxis of colonialisation not 
least in its justification of exploitation and colonial violence Even though the 
idea of race often remained implicit in the circles of government or education
