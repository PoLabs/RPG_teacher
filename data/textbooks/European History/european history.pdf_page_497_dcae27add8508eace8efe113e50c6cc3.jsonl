like Owen in Britaindenounced the misdeeds of capitalism and unbridled 
industrialisation SaintSimon in France joined in this criticism putting 
forward the idea of an ideal society in which the happiness of humanity would 
be based on the progress of industry and science Other Utopian socialists 
also emerged in France and Germany during the turmoil of the 1830s and 
sometimes gave birth to ideal communities such as the Familistre de Guise
