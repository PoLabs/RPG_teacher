inequalities drastically fell other forms of inequality arose the privileges of 
state bureaucracy which included better state housing the maintenance of a 
car access to more exclusive shops more lucrative canteens and restaurants 
etc These privileges were tied to the state offices and in principle they were 
not inheritable
Many western intellectuals refused to recognise the Soviet Union as a 
socialist country They described the system as state capitalism arguing that 
since the state occupied the property vacuum as a result of its extreme form of 
nationalisation the state itself became the main accumulator of wealth and
therefore to themstate capitalism is the most suitable term for the Soviet 
system
Since most western leftists did not follow the Soviet model and historical 
circumstances also did not favour such a development the western answer to 
social inequalities was the building of a welfare state This was for instance 
expressed by the Bad Godesberg Programme adopted by the German 
Social Democratic Party in 1959 where they renounced the idea of replacing 
capitalism and declared their intention to reform it instead improving 
workers material conditions and elevating them to the middle class
Ironically in the 1960s alongside the development of the welfare state 
one could observe a global Marxist renaissance In the United States the New 
Left adopted a strong Marxist language and a Marxist ideology Alongside 
Karl Marx they thought that alienation was the result of the private means 
of production and increased levels of consumption and consumption for

countercultural icon Jerry Rubin who also founded the Youth International 
Partya party which called for a drastic change of private ownership 
generating a more equal society The hippie movement however in general 
lacked a feasible economic programme this was partly the reason for its 
defeat In Europe the leftwing youth of the 1960s achieved their greatest 
success in France where the youth movement was actively assisted by the 
labour movement 
While the hippies of the 1960s advocated for less consumptionor rather 
they rebelled against the consumer societyin Eastern Europe the intellectual 
trend was in the opposite direction Leftwing intellectuals strongly criticised 
Stalinisttype societies for creating new inequalities in the form of special 
privileges reserved for the state bureaucracy and they called for more rather 
than less socialism Examples of these perspectives include the Budapest 
School with gnes Heller and Ivn Szelny the Praxis Circle in Yugoslavia 
Polish intellectuals such as Adam Michnik or Zygmunt Bauman and the 
intellectual advocates of the Prague Spring At the same time the economic 
planners envisaged a more capitalist society in the sense that there ought
