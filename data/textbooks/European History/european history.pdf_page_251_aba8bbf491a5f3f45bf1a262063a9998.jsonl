Introduction
Inequality can refer to very different areas of human life and experience but at 
present it is most common to conceive of inequality as an economic indicator 
Inequality usually refers to economic differencesin wealth income or in 
access to goods and services This section aims instead to illustrate social and 
political inequality in early modern Europe It analyses differences in social 
conditions and practices along with inequalities of access to the political arena 
or to participation in government local or general The focus is first placed on 
a general description of the structural inequalities in early modern Europe and 
on the development of ideas of political equality up to the French Revolution 
Second the family is presented as a model of systemic inequality and gender 
inequality is addressed Lastly Racial inequalities are discussed though it is 
maintained throughout that different sources of inequality intersected and 
interacted in the early modern age
Structural Inequalities in Early Modern Europe
Inequality is a more complex idea than it may seem at first sight because 
it necessarily implies the concept of equality However a sense that all the 
individuals who compose a given society are or should be considered equal 
developed very slowly up to 1800 It may now seem obvious or natural to 
conceive of the world as made of individuals that at least in theory are equal 
according to central criteria such as rights liberties or personal choice But 
the idea of equality among human beings is a sophisticated one It did not 
develop overnight in Europe nor did its arrival erase previous social practices 
completely
