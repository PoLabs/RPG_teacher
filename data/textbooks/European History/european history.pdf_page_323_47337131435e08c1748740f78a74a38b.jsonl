32 EMPIRE AND COLONIALISM

left their country for good not least if they had fled from serfdom service 
obligations or persecution 
The Spanish and Portuguese who went to the Indies were a diverse group 
Most came from the lower nobility others were traders For the Estado da India 
the defence of trade routes shaped the type of migrants fidalgos nobles and 
officers occupied the key positions to maintain the trade monopolies most 
people of Portuguese origin however were soldiers sailors and convicts The 
fidalgos had less interest in Portuguese America where most colonists were 
soldiers convicts and adventurers partly attracted by the discovery of gold 
mines Numerous missionaries were also among the migrants 
In most of South America and the Caribbean a small number of 
administrators ran the slave plantations The absence of significant political 
structures in Portuguese America made it easier to justify slavery While slaves 
of African origin predominated in northeastern Brazil indigenous slaves did 
most of the manual work elsewhere Forced labour however underpinned 
colonial ventures across the globe The exploitative nature of colonialism 
necessitated coercion
In Russia locals were coopted into positions of borderland authority 
in exchange for military service they were granted land on the frontier 
While many privileges were withheld from nonChristians the borderland 
populations were gradually integrated into imperial society After serfdom 
was formalised for peasants who lived on manorial lands 1649 such peasants 
were transferred from central provinces to the periphery in large numbers 
by the eighteenth century the lower Volga alone had received half a million 
migrants Runaway serfs and convicts retired soldiers and religious dissidents 
joined them on the frontier which outside towns and forts remained outside 
the centres reach Yet as in the Americas the frontier was not empty Russian 
rulers displaced borderland communities considered unruly or economically 
dispensable including the nomadic Kalmyks and the autonomous Cossacks 
The regions forcibly emptied were colonised by Slavic and other European 
settlers attracted by promises of religious freedom and material benefits 
In Spanish America the conquest of the native empires aided by indigenous 
peoples such as the Tlaxcaltecas turned most locals into subjects While they 
could not be enslaved for this reason they had to pay tribute and were forcibly 
Christianised A differentiated legal regime allowed some preHispanic legal 
practices to survive and granted indigenous people a degree of autonomy but 
it also helped to ensure Spanish domination 
Formal migration was complemented by informal forms of colonisation 
that reflected the gender imbalance of migratory flows and acted largely 
outside the law It led to settlers interacting with local women and producing 
a mestizo creolised society The crown eventually allowed settlers to bring
