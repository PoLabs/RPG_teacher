happened in the medieval period and during the early modern age often in a 
localised manner with particular regions suffering from high mortality rates 
while others were spared according to conditions War in particular affected 
regions differently the late medieval and early modern wars of the Ottomans 
in the Balkans and the Carpathian Basin the Wars of Religion in France and the 
Thirty Years War in Germanspeaking areas took a tremendous toll in those 
parts of Europe involved in the conflict but other areas did not experience these 
shocks to mortality In most cases economic crises only affected particular 
polities and in many cases these led to the rapid economic development of 
other competing regions While famines were recurrent in much of Europe up 
to the high Middle Ages they became much more local phenomena by the late 
Middle Ages However they never fully went away and continued to strike 
early modern Europe as a result of military campaigns extreme weather 
plant or animal diseases or the confluence of multiple factors Most of these 
famines were still limited to specific parts of Europe such as the Russian 
famine of 16001603 the Irish Famine of 17401741 or the Great Czech Famine 
of 17701771 The kind of Europeanscale famines that had occurred in the 
later Middle Ages and the early modern times became less frequent The Great 
Famine of 13151317 was probably the only late medieval example of such a 
famine occurring on a European scale It was followed in early modern times 
by food crises and famines from 15901598 and from 16931697
Epidemic diseases were also a significant cause of mortality Smallpox 
influenza measles syphilis malaria and socalled sweating sickness were 
all present in certain phases of the early modern period causing serious 
epidemics in some regions However none proved to be as lethal as the plague 
The socalled second plague pandemic that began in the midfourteenth or 
according to other estimates the midthirteenth century and recurred in 
some areas until as late as the early nineteenth century was a major factor in 
mortality throughout early modern Europe After the wave of Black Death of 
the 1340s and 1350s the plague never again caused comparable demographic 
crises on a Europewide scale but its recurrent spikes did cause regional 
and local demographic stress While the plague was long believed to have 
been a primarily urban phenomenon or one which affected male and female 
populations differently further aggravating its demographic impacts such 
claims have recently been disproved While there were obvious differences 
in the waves of plagues in different parts of EuropeItaly likely suffered 
more than areas north of the Alps or in Eastern Europeboth urban centres 
and rural areas and both male as well as female populations were severely 
affected for decades
