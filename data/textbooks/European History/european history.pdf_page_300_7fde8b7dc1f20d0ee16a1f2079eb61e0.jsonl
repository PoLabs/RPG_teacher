Claiming to stand above party politics the monarchs appeared as integrative 
factors of the states even in the multinational Habsburg Empire with its fragile 
balance of different national movements 
Besides these publicfacing political institutions there were other less 
conspicuous forms which more subtly fostered the economic social or 
cultural cohesion of a nation Compulsory military service attempted to 
enhance the states military power and generate political participation among 
conscripted soldiers who were taught to sacrifice their lives in the defence 
of the beloved nation Magnificent new buildings were erected in European 
capitals representing the glory and modernity of the nation or by using 
neoRomanesque or neoGothic stylistic elements its historical tradition 
Buildings like the Palace of Westminster in London the Stortingsbygningen in 
Oslo or the Orszghz in Budapest accommodated political institutions such 
as ministries and the parliaments States also erected majestic buildings for 
economic institutions like central banks National theatres and opera houses as 
well as national museums national libraries and national archives preserved 
and propagated the cultural heritage of the nation 
National literatures were also developed including widely known

a Schicksalsgemeinschaft community of fate by writing histories in a specific 
national manner typically they would narrate the history of the nation as 
alternating periods of prosperity and struggle while portraying the lives of 
peoples whose origins were rooted in medieval or even ancient times In the 
economic sphere standardised weights and measures as well as a common 
national currencies let different regions grow together For instance the 1834 
German Customs Union played an important role in the economic unification 
of the German principalities As the economist Friedrich List put it the aim 
was to bind the Germans economically into a nation

like coloured maps that established clearcut boundaries illustrated the 
sovereignty of the European nationstates and underlined the exclusionary 
character of national belonging Flags ribbons and brooches with the national 
colours were used in everyday life to showliterallyones true colours 
Anthems were composed to strengthen national sentiments and celebrate the 
fateful struggle for independence and the glory of the nation They were played 
on festive days like the rulers birthday or important historical anniversaries 
Monuments paintings and caricatures were decorated with iconic allegories 
as personifications of the nation which could either be female Marianne
