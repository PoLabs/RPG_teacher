UNIT 3 POWER AND CITIZENSHIP

Democratisation and the value it put on citizenship rights was not an 
immediate consequence of the new conditions brought about by the end of the 
First World War These developments were challenged by the consolidation of 
the USSR but also by the rise of fascism which radicalised nationalism whilst 
denying most rights to citizens and excluding different minorities from the 
nation Matters changed after the Second World War In 1950 TH Marshall 
published Citizenship and Social Class a book that was to give shape to a new 
history of citizenship based on the acquisition of successive generations of 
rights According to Marshall pressure from below forced states to grant civil 
rights then political rights and finally social and economic rights to growing 
portions of the population developing a more ample and full citizenship under 
the welfare state a new device of social integration This type of state reaching 
its most advanced form in the United Kingdom and Sweden introduced as 
a general principle that the state should finance a growing bundle of social 
services health education social insurances in order to protect all citizens 
and promote basic equality among them The welfare states progressive 
narrative was not limited to the Westcommunist regimes interpreted it in 
the light of MarxistLeninist ideology and the subordination of individual 
rights to collective endeavours On the other end of the political spectrum 
neocolonialist and developmentalist discourses posited that economic and 
cultural modernisation which could impose restrictions on all kinds of rights 
was a precondition for democratisation
The new social movements of the 1960s questioned the inclusiveness 
of existing citizenship structures The American civil rights movement 
condemned the fact that black Americans were excluded from full citizenship 
status and these debates made their way to Europe as well Feminists criticised 
the genderneutral presentation of citizenship when in reality the full privilege 
of this status was only granted to men Gay and lesbian movements rejected 
their own legal and social exclusion Leftwing militants from Berkeley to Paris 
and Berlin argued that formal rights served to obscure the real authoritarian 
dynamics that dominated life in businesses universities and public 
offices as well as the relationship between the West and the Third World 
Simultaneously dissidents in the Eastern Bloc attempted with scarce results 
in the short term to put human rights on the public agenda of communist 
societies A contradictory trend emerged as a result of all these forces On the 
one hand rights and political recognition were extended to various groups 
in various societies On the other hand these developments provoked a neo
conservative reaction that rejected the very notion of socioeconomic rights 
criticising the welfare state for supposedly transforming citizens into overly 
dependent subjects At the same time processes of globalisation have eroded
