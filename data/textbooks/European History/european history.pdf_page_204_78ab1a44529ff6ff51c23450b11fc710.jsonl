Galicia for example was comprised of Ruthenians Poles Jews and Austrian

in the late nineteenth century Ethnically mixed cities were the rule rather than 
the exception in several parts of the region Ethnic maps of the period can 
therefore only provide an approximate image of regional and subregional 
colourfulness and do not sufficiently reflect the actual complexity of local 
conditions In addition to the local ethnicities cities in the Austrian half of

Mass migration often thoroughly altered the ethnic composition of 
nineteenthcentury cities while transforming their social structure Some of the 
major regional capitals such as Prague or Lemberg in Polish Lww present

claims to public space Efforts by Czech elites to seize and symbolically recast 
Prague as a Czech city and of Polish elites to sustain Lembergs image as a 
Polish city were contradicted by the politics of ethnic survival as described

Prague and by the growing presence of Ukrainian claims in the capital of 
Austrian Galicia At the street level territories and places were symbolically 
appropriated such as the Czech or German promenades that stretched 
westwards and eastwards from Pragues Wenceslas Square

they were perceived as an ethnoreligious group by many contemporaries as

Orthodox Assimilated Jews on the other hand tended to identify themselves
