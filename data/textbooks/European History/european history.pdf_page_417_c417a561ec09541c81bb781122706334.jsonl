Martin Luthers 14831546 criticisms of the doctrines and practices of 
the Roman Catholic Church first shared with a wider public in 1517 became 
politicised almost from the start This was inevitable given the intricate 
connections between religion and politics in the sixteenth century But it was 
also inevitable because Luther provided a perfect vehicle for certain political 
agendas In sixteenthcentury Europe one of the most important issues was 
the balance between central authority and local autonomy This had been the 
key issue in the Spanish revolts and it would prove to be in many Reformation 
struggles 
In June 1524 hundreds of farmers in the Breisgau area of southwestern 
Germany rose in arms against the exactions imposed by their lord This 
movement had been imbued with Reformation ideas by a travelling preacher 
The unrest then spilled over into neighbouring regions of southern Germany 
where the rebels coordinated their activities in a Peasants Parliament in 
March 1525 They adopted a common programme the Twelve Articles which 
articulated both social and religious demands The first article insisted that 
each town and village would have the right to elect its own priests in effect 
taking control over the priesthood and their ideas away from the Catholic 
Church Other rural areas and many small towns then joined this massive 
rebellion which came to be known as the Peasants War 
In 1525 while large parts of Germany were in turmoil the guilds of Mnster 
in German Westphalia extracted various concessions from their own lord 
Westphalia was ruled by a bishop who resided in Mnster The citys elites 
and citizens however broadly resented the bishops authority over them 
After the peasants had been defeated all concessions were reversed but the 
Reformation movement did not disappear In 1532 the parish of Lamberti 
selected a reformminded priest who went on to publish a booklet in which he 
rejected child baptism and proclaimed that transubstantiation was a symbolic 
act that the bread and wine did not really change into the flesh and blood of 
Christ He was thus undermining two sacred ideas of the Catholic Church and 
demonstrating his allegiance to a group called the Anabaptists who favoured 
adult baptism Other Anabaptists were invited to come to Mnster The 
bishop in the meantime amassed his troops around the city triggering a full
blown revolution Private property was abolished and polygamy introduced 
showing that radical religious ideas could lead to much broader reforms All 
of this happened with the ostensible support of broad sections of the towns 
population and more specifically the artisans and shopkeepers who made up 
the membership of the local guilds The leaders of this rebellion who came 
from the adjacent Low Countries were also artisans Ultimately the Mnster 
Anabaptist revolution was defeated by the military might of the bishop but in
