Missionary activity was just one domain of cultural imperialism cultural 
imperialism was also manifest in the spread of European languages across the 
globe the spread of European dress and ways of living and Western style 
education The spread of European medicine particularly in the late nineteenth 
century served to showcase the superiority of European science its capacity 
to save lives and cure diseases thus winning support from the newly subjected 
populations but on the other hand by using the bodies of native populations 
as study material often without asking for consent the practice of medicine in 
nonEuropean settings further confirmed colonial domination
There were also other sciences that were closely tied to colonialism In fact 
colonies often became laboratories for developing European natural science 
or testing grounds for medical experiments The progress of science and 
medicine in turn was used to legitimise colonial expansion Thus colonialism 
and science reinforced each othercolonialism structured scientific thought 
and gave new directions to research
Anthropology the science of the study of humanity was established as a 
standard academic discipline in the course of the nineteenth century and its 
objectives and methods were defined within the frame of the second colonialist 
thrust of European expansion in other continents Intellectual specialised 
systems of knowledge thus immediately acquired political relevance as 
through anthropology the supposed superiority of the white European was 
established as a rationalised positive truth 
Throughout the nineteenth century museums were purposefully constructed 
as temples of sciencea phrase often used by contemporary authorsand 
as repositories of objective tangible knowledge Through museum displays the 
aspirations of Europe to political and cultural superiority over the rest of the 
world were given scientific support through showcasing the primitiveness 
of nonEuropean technologies or nonEuropean religious superstitions 
Similar messages were presented in ethnographical showslive displays of 
nonEuropeans performing their everyday life in front of paying audiences 
These shows were enormously popular in Europe between the 1870s and the 
First World War
Through institutions like these members of nations not directly involved 
in colonial enterprise could show what Ulla Vuorela has termed for the case 
of Finland colonial complicity Colonialist and imperialist discourse was 
not limited to those countries directly involved in expansion overseas There 
were societies within Europe that had remained outside explicit colonial 
interests or overseas possessions but nevertheless engaged in colonial projects 
in a variety of waysand also benefitted materially from these interactions 
They actively participated in hegemonic discourses as these were developed 
in the colonising metropoles thus identifying themselves with European
