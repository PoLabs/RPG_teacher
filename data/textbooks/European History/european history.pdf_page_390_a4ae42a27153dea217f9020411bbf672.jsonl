call the Diplomatic Revolution The Seven Years War had two root causes 
continental rivalry between Austria and Prussia and colonial rivalry between 
France and Great Britain Frederick the Great won an astounding victory 
against a much larger FrancoAustrian army at Rossbach in Saxony in 1757 
but was soon surrounded by the combined forces of the French Austrian and 
Russian armies An accident of history saved Frederick the Great as Empress 
Elizabeth of Russia 17091762 died in 1762 succeeded by the great admirer 
of Frederick and Prussia Peter III 17281762 Russia thus concluded a peace 
treaty with Prussia and Frederick was able to hold onto all his territories Great 
Britain enjoyed naval superiority from the 1750s onwards and was able to 
defeat French fleets in North America India and the West Indies The Treaty of 
Paris 1763 which ended the conflict had truly colossal consequences France 
ceded all of Canada to Britain and removed its military from India but kept 
its wealthy West Indian islands The desire to avenge this humiliating defeat 
was one of the reasons why France supported the American revolutionaries in 
the American Revolutionary War 17751783 support that was crucial to its 
success
Two elements fundamental to modern warfare would develop in the French 
Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras 17891815 a popular subscription
based army infused with patriotism and the mobilisation of almost all of 
societys resources for warfare total war Revolutionary and Napoleonic 
France was at war with every European power at one point or another in this 
period and was sometimes in conflict with all at once While initially suffering 
from disorder and lack of experience the revolutionary army quickly won 
spectacular victories partially thanks to the use of innovative battle tactics 
made possible by patriotic troops fighting for a revolution they themselves 
had helped to create Napoleon 17691821 was able to mobilise the energy 
unleashed by the revolution into a very effective war machine capable of 
fighting quick and decisive battles trampling over the balance of power 
system that had characterised the conduct of war throughout the eighteenth 
century Once Napoleon met his demise in Russia and Waterloo between 
1812 and 1815 there developed a new conception of European international 
relations captured by the term Concert of Europe This was characterised by 
greater selfrestraint on the part of large power players and the more ready 
recognition that the legitimate interests of other states must be recognised for 
longerterm stability to be achieved
Conclusion
European warfare changed so dramatically in the early modern period that if 
an observer from 1500 could have witnessed practices of war and peace in 1800
