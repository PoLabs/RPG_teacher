nomadic lifestyle Nomadism became highly exceptional towards the end of 
the twentieth century in Europe although it remains a stereotype associated 
with Europes largest ethnic minority the Romani people However they use 
different names such as Roma and Sinti Ashkali Lovari Kale Cal and many 
others they speak their own Romani andor other languages and they follow 
various religious traditions The Romani people are present in every European 
country from Finland in the north to Andalusia in the south Throughout the 
twentieth century they were stigmatised in various ways from the names 
given to them by outsiders to open forms of racism and persecution which 
peaked during the Second World War Estimations by Romani organisations 
of their total population size in Europe vary between ten and fourteen million 
Spain has the largest Roma population in Western Europe 725000750000 
whereas other significant centres are in the Balkans
Ethnic Relations in Europe ca 19181945
As these examples show it is extremely difficult to grasp Europe and its 
interethnic relations across the twentieth century from only one perspective 
It is nevertheless possible to draw a distinction between developments 
in the western southwestern and northern parts of the continent on the 
one hand and the central eastern and southeastern parts on the other In 
Western Europe a consolidation of nationstate structures accompanied by 
ethnic homogenisation took place earlier than elsewhere though often later 
than commonly assumed In Central and Eastern Europe stretching from 
presentday Poland Czechia Slovakia Austria and Hungary eastwards to 
the western Balkans ethnic diversity within the spaces of former multiethnic 
empires persisted much longer Whether it was the AustroHungarian the 
Ottoman or the Russian Empire all of these prenational political structures 
were intrinsically multiethnic 
The difference between mostly monoethnic nationstates and multi
ethnic empires also helps to explain why interethnic violence and tensions 
often arose in areas which became nationstates comparatively late the logic 
of nationalism stresses the alignment of territory population and political 
power sovereignty within one nation According to this logic ethnic 
difference can easily turn into violent conflict over resources especially when 
new borders are drawn new state bureaucracies emerge or when citizenship 
is redefined along linguistic religious or other ethnic criteria Nationalist 
regimes homogenised populations through policies of social engineering that 
reshaped their demographic or ethnic composition such as through ethnic 
cleansing forced resettlement assimilation or genocide
