line that crossed its centre from Germany to Italy The myriads of micro
borders that once crisscrossed this longitudinal swathe of the European 
continent disappeared during the nineteenth century after the initial impulse 
of the Napoleonic conquests This formerly splintered territory was replaced 
by two sizeable territorial units the German Empire and the Kingdom of Italy 
as well as several small and mediumsized states the Netherlands Belgium 
Luxembourg and Switzerland In the same period by contrast the western 
half of the continent remained reliably compact from a territorial point of view 
with minor border changes And in Eastern Europe though they faced wars 
and revolutionary upheavals the Habsburg and Tsarist Empires remained 
firmly in control of their territories and even increased their possessions 
marginally This meant an increasing differentiation between east and west in 
Western Europe modern nationstates were emerging while more traditional 
empires survived in the east a dynamic that produced its own territorial 
shifts An example is the case of the Habsburg Empire around the turn of 
the nineteenth century In 1795 during the French Revolutionary Wars the 
Habsburgs lost their lowland provinces in northwestern Europe to France 
but simultaneously acquired the eastern territory of Galicia with the partition 
of Poland Yet Galicias borders were not as clearly defined as those of the Low 
Countries and its linguistic and religious composition was also much more 
mixed than the Habsburg Empires western hereditary provinces including 
the lands of the Czech crown 
The exception to this rule of territorial preservation and consolidation is 
to be found in the Balkans on the European fringes of the Ottoman Empire 
which by the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century 
had transformed into several small independent states 
Cultural Transformation
In the nineteenth century a wave of nationalism spread across Europe creating 
political movements among many of the nations and ethnic groups of the 
continent from Spain to Russia and from Norway to the Balkans During the 
Napoleonic Wars the fight against external aggression triggered uprisings in 
many countries based on the concept of the nation This rallying point did not 
disappear after the end of the war On the contrary ideas of national unity 
and collective identity such as people sharing the same language culture 
history and territoryelements of what the scholar Benedict Anderson called 
an imagined communitystarted to play an increasingly important role
Whether they were big or small independent entities or subjects of 
empire various European communities sought to define and assert their 
national identity Apart from a shared language history culture or religion 
a common territory or homeland was one of the most important symbols
