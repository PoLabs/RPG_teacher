Introduction
In the nineteenth century large swaths of the worlds territory came under 
colonial rule By the early twentieth century close to forty percent of the 
worlds land area was under formal control of either longstanding imperial 
powers like Britain France Portugal or the Netherlands or new claimants 
like the United States and Japan Most notably Britain established formal 
rule over the entirety of presentday India Pakistan and Bangladesh in 1858 
a year after the suppressed Indian Rebellion In the last two decades of the 
nineteenth century Africa was effectively divided by European powers What 
set the socalled New Imperialism of the nineteenth century apart from its 
earlymodern predecessors was the shift to the full and formal incorporation of 
territories into European polities as opposed to the haphazard and patchwork 
modes of domination that marked earlier rule which was often carried out by 
nominally private entities like the British East India Company EIC and its 
counterparts in other empires Overseas imperialism may have been around 
since the early modern period but the redbespattered maps that showed an 
empire on which the sun never set were a product of the nineteenth century
This chapter explores why New Imperialism emerged how it operated 
and how it was met around the world The answers traditionally point 
at economic incentivesimperial powers turned to formal control when 
informal control the socalled gunboat diplomacy did not achieve their 
aimsbut as this chapter will show ideological motives from above and 
below were just as important Colonial ventures met anticolonial resistance 
of many sorts Colonisers increasingly justified their exploits by claiming to 
bring civilisation and partaking in this socalled civilising mission was not 
limited to citizens from imperial powers but was a transnational European
