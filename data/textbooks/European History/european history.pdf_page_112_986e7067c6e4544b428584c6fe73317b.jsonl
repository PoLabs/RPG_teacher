round European empires encouraged the emigration of their citizens to settler 
colonies From the 1920s onwards settlement colonialism even experienced 
a remarkable boom after the United States had limited entry to its territory 
through quota laws practically ending mass immigration from Europe For 
example the colonies especially the dominions became the most important 
destination for British emigration after the First World War The state sought 
to control and intensify this process the Overseas Settlement Committee 
1920 encouraged the settlement of demobilised soldiers by financing their 
journey and the Empire Settlement Act 1922 facilitated the departure from 
Britain of more than 400000 people Similarly French emigration to Algeria 
and the Maghreb protectorates Morocco and Tunisia increased in the 1920s 
and 1930s In the Italian Empire mass emigration began in the mid1930s with 
the settlement programme launched by Mussolini to benefit the unemployed 
and landless peasants Portugal belatedly launched a supervised emigration 
programme to its African colonies Angola and Mozambique which 
accounted for fifty percent of Portuguese emigration in the 1950s 
Over the course of the century many of these European settlers were forced 
to return Decolonisation after the Second World War led to the repatriation 
of millions of Europeans British French Italian Belgian Portuguese and 
Dutch These returnees benefited from assisted return and reintegration 
programmes which they often considered insufficient The auxiliaries of the 
colonial armies however often received less support for example the Harkis 
auxiliaries of the French army in Algeria who managed to relocate to France 
at the end of the Algerian Independence War 19541962 were permanently 
housed in camps
Labour migration to the colonial metropoles began with the First World War 
For example more than 225000 workers were recruited in the French colonies 
to replace the mobilised workers in the factories By 1931 there were about 
100000 Algerians in France and although their movement was not regulated 
the authorities sought to control them through health and social institutions 
Algerian immigration increased sharply after 1945 and the Algerian War of 
Independence did not interrupt this movement but led to its stabilisation 
periods of residence became longer and family immigration increased 
A similar pattern was present in the decolonisation of the Dutch Empire 
some 300000 migrants predominantly Eurasians of mixed descent came 
to the Netherlands between 1946 and 1964 Before and after Surinamese 
Independence in 1975 some 190000 peoplealmost half of the population
arrived in the former motherland In this period another 100000 people from 
the Dutch Antilles moved to the European part of the Dutch Kingdom
