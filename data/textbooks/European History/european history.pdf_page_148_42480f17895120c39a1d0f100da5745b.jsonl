currently adopted by many indigenous communities as a counterhegemonic 
designation for the continent Although the regions countries were for several 
centuries dependent on foreign powers and organisations it is clear that the 
twentieth century initiated a new stage in relations between Europe and Latin 
America especially after the two World Wars 
During the first decades of the twentieth century Latin American countries 
embarked on a profound reflection on their identities Brazil for example did so 
through the modernist movement One document that represents the thinking 
of this movement is the Anthropophagic Manifesto published in 1928 by the 
Brazilian poet Oswald de Andrade 18901954 The manifesto claimed a form 
of avantgarde art that sought to cannibalise the European spirit referring 
to anthropophagic rituals and unite this legacy with that of indigenous and 
African communities in order to establish a true national identity This 
search for a new identity took place in the context of the declining European 
hegemony after the First World War Some decades later during the Second 
World War Latin America achieved greater autonomy to make independent 
negotiations with world powers such as Germany the United States or Spain 
The politics of Argentinian President Juan Domingo Pern 18951974 or 
the Brazilian leader Getlio Vargas 18821954 are clear examples of a more 
autonomous diplomacy in this period This development paved the way for a 
new period of relations between Europe and Latin America in which Europe 
came to see the Latin American nations as more equal to itself
However certain former imperial metropoles attempted to revisit symbols 
of the colonial past in order to forge new relationships with their former 
colonies For example during the years of General Francisco Francos regime 
Spain considered HispanoAmerica to be a part of its nationalist ideological 
project as it sought to recover symbols of the past such as Catholicism the 
Castilian language imperialism and the historical unity of Spain and Latin 
America The aim was to form a kind of spiritual community the Hispanic 
race which was to include Latin American countries Portugal on the other 
hand given its relatively weak economic and political position for much of 
the twentieth century stood in the shadow of its former colony the immense 
Brazil Whereas stereotypes of Brazil may previously have revolved mainly 
around its image as the country of football carnival samba and exotic nature 
by the end of the twentieth century it was one of the worlds major economic 
powers and in the first decade of the twentyfirst century it joined the bloc of 
major emerging national economies known as BRICS Brazil Russia India 
China and South Africa 
Thus while Europe might view Latin America as a continent facing diverse 
challenges such as economic and social inequality violence in urban centres 
corruption and authoritarian governments its nations have also come to be
