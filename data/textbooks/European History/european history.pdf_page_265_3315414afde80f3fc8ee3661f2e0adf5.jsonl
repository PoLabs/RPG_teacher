a strong barrier in their relationship with civil servants and a real obstacle 
to climbing the social ladder In Britain for example English which already 
held legal and political dominance increasingly displaced the indigenous 
languages of Irish Gaelic Scots Gaelic and Welsh which were discriminated 
against in the legal system and outright banned in many schools In some 
cases children were punished for using mother tongues other than English 
and there were a great many cultural disadvantages to not being able to speak 
English Very often when a linguistic group had a cultural elite of its own its 
members organised a defence of the collective culture that could lead to the 
creation of regionalist or nationalist movements as happened in the Austrian 
Empire the Russian Empire Belgium and Spain 
Jewish migration across Europe increased over the course of the nineteenth 
century in part due to pogroms and other antisemitic violence in Russia 
Within this timeframe antisemitism became increasingly laden with ideas 
about racial as well as religious difference as demonstrated by antisemitic 
cartoons and caricatures which increasingly depicted Jewish people as being 
ethnically different Whilst some historians have focused on the specific roots 
of antisemitism in Germany due to the later rise of Nazism antisemitism was 
widespread in nineteenth and early twentiethcentury Europe In France 
where a strong tradition of antiJewish and eventually antisemitic literature 
developed following the different measures that emancipated Jews the 
Dreyfus Affair 18941906 revealed deep schisms in society over questions 
about Jewishness and belonging to the nation In Britain Jewish migrants 
who largely moved to major cities particularly London were used as cheap 
labour New Jewish migrants mainly of Ashkenazi origin who started 
arriving from 1880 onwards tended to remain distinct from the established 
British Jewish community with the former occupying a more impoverished 
and less enfranchised position Here we can strongly see the relationship 
between class religion and ethnicity as the hostility towards Jewish migrants 
in part arose from their impoverished position and in part contributed to it 
All over Europe Romani people faced discrimination in social and legal 
terms Industriousness honest ways of earning a living and other new socio
political understandings of what was proper and improper effectively 
criminalised their activities The nomadic way of life of many Roma and 
Sinti people excluded them from political rights at all levels even after the 
introduction of universal male suffrage because those rights were associated 
with permanent residence Racist discourses cast them as members of the 
European underworld or alternatively as primitive people Liberalism 
therefore did not bring about the emancipation of the dispersed Roma and 
Sinti groups
