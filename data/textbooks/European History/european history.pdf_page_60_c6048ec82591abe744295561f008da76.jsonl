taxation rights and feudal obligations Their permeability was the result of 
various factors most importantly the lax enforcement of border controls The 
lack of a fixed or agreed division between one territory and another was quite 
common and even when they were fixed the borders were frequently ignored 
by the people crossing them often with the silent approval of the lords This 
permeability allowed thesometimes illegaltransfer of goods and people 
from one jurisdiction to another and also between tax and price regimes Despite 
this permeability the differences between residing under one jurisdiction as 
opposed to another were nevertheless known to contemporaries who often 
utilised these modalities to their own advantage In this sense many borders 
had a fixed character respected by local inhabitants on both sides
States could shift their boundaries in early modern times in various ways 
among them war inheritance or exchange However local boundaries and 
lesser jurisdictions usually remained intact on such occasions That means they 
were taken over by the new ruler but their inner coherence and outer borders 
remained unchanged Such was the case in France and in the Habsburg Empire 
This dynamic manifested during the early modern era in a mosaic of various 
types of regions subject to a supreme ruler but conserving the original inner 
political structures including tax regimes and even systems of ecclesiastical 
governance In this regard we could think of Europe as a palimpsest of civil 
and ecclesiastical borders with its lowest layers almost always longstanding 
and broadly accepted even when fiercely disputed in detail Thus border 
disputes tended to assume a chronic character in early modern Europe 
Mental Borders and Frontier Regions
Cartography developed slowly over the course of the early modern period 
and it was only by the eighteenth century that relatively precise maps could be 
produced Also cartography was not an autonomous intellectual discipline 
rather it reflected the power aspirations of its patrons particularly the rulers 
that invested in it Enlightenment thinkers as well as enlightened rulers 
sought ordered and rational investigations of nature but also endeavoured 
to influence statecraft by employing surveyors and other experts to identify 
cartographic resources and establish an efficient basis for tax assessment
In France for example the mapping of natural territory had a considerable 
influence on the mental mapping of desired borders resulting in policies to 
gain control over natural boundaries The Pyrenees in the south formed one 
of these desired borders as did the Rhine between Germany and France At 
the Rhine cartographers from both nations worked to combine natural and 
political boundaries by drawing state borders along the course provided by 
the river However studying the political maps of the eighteenth century can
