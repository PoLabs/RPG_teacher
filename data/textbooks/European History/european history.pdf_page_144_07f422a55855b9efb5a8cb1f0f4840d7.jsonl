yardstick These perceptions of Asia oscillated between anticommunist fears 
of an Oriental despotism grand hopes of Westernisation and democratisation 
and disillusionment with idiosyncratic paths to modernity
After the First World War when European ideas of political order monarchic 
and liberal alike were in a state of crisis the Asian continent appeared to be 
a source of both inspiration and threat The Paris Peace Conference 1919
1920 revealed that Asia was still perceived as part of the European sphere of 
influence In an act of great power politics the Western nations decided to hand 
over Qingdao then a Germany colony in China to Japan instead of returning 
it to Chinese sovereignty The May Fourth Movement 1919 a political protest 
movement that erupted in China in response to its treatment as a bargaining 
chip by foreign powers paradoxically called for Westernisation as a means of 
modernisation At the same time some European writers regarded the First 
World War as having undermined the traditions of European intellectual 
thought finding new inspiration in Chinese Daoism Other European 
intellectuals like the German sociologist Max Weber conceived of Asia 
as Europes religious and cultural other in order to explain why modern 
capitalism had only emerged in Europe itself The Russian Revolution 1917 
on the other hand became another seminal moment that had a severe impact on 
perceptions of Asia in Europe Early nineteenthcentury notions of an Oriental 
despotism reemerged after the Soviet Union had established a communist 
dictatorship throughout Eurasia along with rising fears of westward Soviet 
expansion that could threaten the fragile political order of interwar Europe 
Insulating Europe from revolution thus motivated an Allied intervention in 
the Russian Civil War 19171922
After the Second World War older assumptions about Europes relationship 
with Asia were both strengthened and challenged by Cold War divisions in 
Europe which split the continent into two opposing political systems With 
a socialist bloc emerging on its eastern edge the idea of Europe as a liberal 
realm seemed to diminish whereas communism was on the rise In Western 
Europe and the United States an anticommunist red scare was built on older 
narratives of the dangerous and evil east In August 1949 a few months before 
China would also turn communist the conservative Christian Democratic 
Union of West Germany portrayed a gloomy Asianlooking Bolshevik seizing 
hold of Europe an innocent Europe that was to be defended by conservative 
values see Figure 2 Leftwing intellectuals in Cold War Western Europe on 
the other hand were inspired by communist China as an alternative to both 
Western capitalism and Soviet socialism though they largely neglected to 
speak of the millions of Chinese who were victims of starvation Paradoxically 
Mao became a symbol of domestic protest among parts of European youth
