the risk of losses on the warfronts The dawn of the information age in which 
machines started to communicate with each other seemingly without human 
intervention arrived in the military sphere decades before computation 
reached individual consumers
But technologies and technical expertise did not blossom solely under the 
auspices of the growing power of the state After the First World War experts 
developed panEuropean efforts and organisations aiming at the formation 
of a European technological space interconnected through common 
infrastructures standards and regulatory regimes for the use of technologies 
During the Great Depression panEuropean expert organisations developed 
plans which explicitly tied the building and operation of networks with the 
idea of Europe what scholars such as Frank Schipper and Johan Schot call 
infrastructural Europeanism After the Second World War the cooperation 
of European nations in technology development and regulation intensified 
on both sides of the Iron Curtain Nuclear technology provides an illustrative 
example here In the West an intergovernmental research organisation called 
CERN appeared in 1951 soon to be followed by the Joint Institute for Nuclear 
Research JINR in Moscow Other examples would be the European Space 
Agency 1975 or the rather less successful case of the Eurofighter Typhoon 
Despite the existence of the Iron Curtain the second half of the twentieth 
century witnessed a slow and contested process of technological integration 
across the continent which contributed to the successful reintegration of both 
sides after 1989 Europes international Eroad network the interconnected 
power grid and the standardisation of television and radio broadcasting 
systems represent illustrative examples
Nonetheless the overwhelming march of modernityimagined as the 
wheels of inevitable progress transforming lives and landscapes across 
Europearoused the suspicion of those who feared perhaps naturally 
the potential of technology to subvert divine human or natural orders 
variously defined Envisioning an ultimate clash between man and machine 
critics of technology often claimed to defend the cause of humanity against 
dehumanising mechanisation and the reductive overrationalisation of life 
from the position of morals and ethics With the arrival of the Great Depression 
such voices became louder perhaps best captured by Aldous Huxleys 
dystopian novel Brave New World 1931 Technological innovations related 
to the Second World War including nuclear power and rocket science with 
their combined potential to eradicate humanity added new urgency to the 
debate European philosophers and public intellectuals such as Jacques Ellul 
and Martin Heidegger published radical and penetrating critiques in the mid
1950s of modern societys domination by technology thereby echoing the 
dystopian vision of technology that the Frankfurt Schools Theodor W Adorno
