34 PEACE AND CONFLICT

to the Danube Valley and Mediterranean shipping routes Finally there were 
several confessional wars which bloodied much of Central Europe as a result 
of the Lutheran Reformation This conflict temporarily gave way to an unstable 
peace between the contenders during the 1550s The signing of the Peace of 
Augsburg 1555 which put an end to armed religious conflict in the Empire 
was complemented by another SpanishFrench peacemaking negotiation at 
CateauCambrsis 1559 that sealed Philip IIs 15271598 influence over 
Catholic Europe However fighting in the Mediterranean did not cease but 
rather intensifiedas shown by the Ottoman failure at Malta 1565 and the 
victory of the Holy League formed by Spain and the Italian potentates over 
the Turkish armada at Lepanto 1571 Spanish hegemony was shattered over 
the following decades by the revolt in the Low Countries led by William of 
Orange with English support while confessional tensions between Catholics 
and Calvinists Huguenots led lateValois France to a succession of civil wars 
To this accumulation of conflicts in Western Europe was added the emergence 
of other new actors the Russia of Ivan the Terrible first Tsar since 1547 or

other areas of the world The expansion of the main European powers to other 
latitudes was a concrete reality the Ottoman Empire loomed over the Balkans 
Asia Minor and the Levant as well as Egypt and the southern shores of the 
Mediterranean the Monarchy of Spain exerted influence over much of Western 
and Southern Europe as well as over parts of Africa America and Asia from 
the time of Charles V and Philip II who added Portugal and its overseas 
empire to his inherited possessions the kingdoms of France and England 
as well as the United Provinces of the Netherlands progressively turned 
to search for new global markets at the expense of the SpanishPortuguese 
dynastic conglomerate
In any case the Ottoman Spanish and Dutch influence in European warfare 
was based on different successful and advanced military systems At the end 
of the fifteenth century and in the first decades of the sixteenth century a 
mixture of ancient and modern warfare practices can be seen clearly in the 
War of Granada 14821492 and the Italian Wars 14941559 On a continent 
accustomed to long and bloody conflicts martial practices still revolved 
around chivalry and its codes of honour The role of the military nobility in 
the FrancoBurgundian tradition was hegemonic in the conduct of conflicts
