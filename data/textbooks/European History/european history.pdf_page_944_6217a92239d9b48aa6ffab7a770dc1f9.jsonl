would hear this version of events This was not merely an act of propaganda 
for the monarchy but also a means of creating a collective identity for English 
Protestants by providing them with a foundation in history 
Uses of the Past to Legitimise Political Movements 
Batavians and the Dutch Revolt
The Batavians a Germanic tribe were often cited as the ancestors of the Dutch 
They revolted against Roman overlords in 6970 AD and parallels between 
this rebellion and the Dutch Revolt were frequently made Hugo Grotius 
15831645 a major political thinker of early modern Europe wrote a book 
on this subject called De antiquitate rei publicae Batavicae On the Antiquity of the 
Batavian Republic which was published in 1610 Grotius aim was to establish 
continuity between this Germanic tribe and the Dutch Republic to support 
his argument that the Dutch had been a free people from antiquity onwards 
In the first chapter Grotius states Now this is the most lawful beginning of 
a free state that a people of free origins found it on free soil In doing so 
he links ancestral freedom to both the Dutch people and their land Grotius 
argued that the Dutch were free to elect or remove a sovereign if they did not 
fulfil their duty to act in the best interests of the people This was an oftused 
justification for the Dutch Revolt Philip II had not acted in the best interests 
of the Dutch and therefore they had the right to rebel and even to remove him 
from power 
Thus we can argue that the Batavian Rebellion was viewed as having 
prefigured the Dutch Revolt against Spain Just as Foxes Book of Martyrs 
was intended to help create a sense of common identity amongst English 
Protestants the Batavian Myth created a sense of common origins for the 
Dutch Republic This was expressed in various ways For example in 1613 the 
States Generalthe main governmental body of the Dutch Republicbought 
a series of twelve paintings by Otto van Veen about the Batavian Rebellion to 
be displayed in the room where its assemblies took place Displaying such 
images at this significant political location created a connection between this 
past rebellion and its present government The myth was represented in more 
public spaces as well Geeraerdt Brandt 162685 for example did so in the 
theatrical performance he was commissioned to write for the public celebrations 
in Amsterdam marking the Peace of Mnster 1648 which officially ended the 
war with Spain The title neatly summarised the pieces argument Vertooningen 
van den Oorlog der Batavieren Tegens de Romainen vergeleken met one Oorloog 
tegens Spanje Displays of the War of Batavians against the Romans Compared with 
Our War against Spain These performances were first put on at the market 
square then the Municipal Theatre and eventually they were printed and sold
