In contrast Western parts of the European continent welcomed different forms 
of Americanisation while adapting them to their diverse national contexts The 
strong American presence in the reconstruction of Western Europe resulted 
in the creation of an empire by invitation which gradually resulted in the 
establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO in 1949 By 
the early 1950s Europe was divided into two power blocs representing two 
different political and economic systems with two different approaches to 
modernisation competing with each other in the international arena 
The European states on both sides of the Iron Curtain were instrumental 
in disseminating the superpowers global modernisation models adding 
legitimacy to the claim that the Cold War was predominantly a war of ideas 
The fight against communism meant welcoming even the authoritarian 
states of Francos Spain and Salazars Portugal within the American orbit of 
influence The United States also began to replace European countries as the 
hegemon in the Third World which began to decolonise intensively from the 
mid1950s The Suez Crisis of 1956 demonstrated the weakness of formerly 
influential colonial powers like the United Kingdom and France and publicly 
showcased the difficulties they faced in advancing their goals in the non
European world without the consent of the United States Decolonisation also 
presented an opportunity for the Eastern bloc countries to penetrate areas that 
had previously been the domain of the Western European colonial powers 
EastCentral European socialist countries assisted the Soviet Union to transfer 
the Soviet modernisation model to the newly decolonised states of the Global 
South The Third World became an important Cold War battlefield
However both superpowers hegemonic position in Europe was not entirely 
stable and was constantly in flux throughout the Cold War While Soviet 
leader Joseph Stalin kept his empire close his successor Nikita Khrushchev 
inaugurated a process of destalinisation that sent unintended signals which 
encouraged Poland and Hungary to go their own way in building socialism 
But the bloody suppression of the Hungarian Uprising in 1956 as well as the 
Prague Spring twelve years later showed that the Soviet Union was not about 
to give up influence in its satellites It was only a combination of several 
factors notably economic problems and the change in Soviet leadership in the 
mid1980s that caused a loosening of ties between the USSR and its satellite 
countries resultingultimatelyin the collapse of Soviet hegemony over 
EastCentral Europe
The United States initially supported the European integration process 
after the Second World War but some of the Western European countries 
began to increasingly define themselves politically and economically against 
US influence from the 1960s onward The European Communities EC
