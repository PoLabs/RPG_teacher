principale applied to those cases in which territory was given voluntarily to the 
new sovereign on the basis of an agreement that enshrined the legal equality 
of the two states concerned as in the case of Provence The other form was 
an ancillary union lunion accessoire which subjected the conquered territory 
to the laws of the centre The ancillary union fully incorporated the new lands 
turning them in a sense into mere provinces subject only to the conditions of 
their capitulations With acquisition by conquest becoming the most common 
route of territorial expansion in the seventeenth century the legal integration 
of the territories took on a more absolute character At the same time the 
capitulationsin legal terms a treaty of surrender and a provincial constitution 
in the form of notebookswould set more precise rules for the political game
The assertion of absolutism in the seventeenth century was a powerful 
challenge to the regional constitutional claims Initially only in theory 
central law soon imposed itself in practice on the territories that had become 
provinces of France According to Cardin Le Bret 15581655 a French 
statesman and jurist it was for the sovereigns alone to change the ancient 
laws and ordinances of their Estates which meant both general and municipal 
laws as well as the customs of particular provinces In practice even if the 
sovereign respected local privileges such as communal charters he did not 
want them to do harm to the kingdoms financial performance Louis XIII 
16101643 stopped convening the assemblies of Dauphin and Normandy 
for example to impose tax reforms Over a period of five years 16351639 the 
administrative structure of Normandy was shaken to the core which angered 
local authorities Gathered again in 1638 the provincial Estates expressed their 
profound discontent with the reforms yet the central authority was not overly 
concerned More worried about salt fraud fauxsaunage in these regions it 
decided to establish a salt tax which caused a revolt in 1639 The subsequent 
clampdown targeted the parlement of Rouenone of about a dozen courts of 
law spread out across Francemore than the provincial Estates because the 
parlement was suspected of complacency towards the rebels 
It was not until the period of conflict known as the Fronde 16481653 
when the nobility sought to weaken central power and take control over 
the provincial Estates that Louis XIV 16431715 effectively terminated the 
latters existence The EstatesGeneral had last been convened in 1614 by his 
predecessor The King acted comparably in FrancheComt after conquering 
this territory on the kingdoms eastern border he took the oath of the counts 
of Burgundy but otherwise reserved the right to legislate for himself In the 
capitulation of 1674 he vowed to maintain the provincial estates but never 
convened them The local nobility protested vehemently Yet the King was all 
the more determined since he was faced with a conspiracy that same year
