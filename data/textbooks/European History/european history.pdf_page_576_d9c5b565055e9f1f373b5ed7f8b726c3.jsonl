Atlantic and major industrial accidents such as the dioxin leak in Seveso Italy 
1976 or chemical spill in Basel Switzerland 1986 brought greater attention 
to international pollution problems 
More fundamentally the finite supply of natural resources in Europe and 
the wider world called into question the sustainability of postwar industrial 
society Bestsellers like The Population Bomb Paul Ehrlich 1968 or Blueprint 
for Survival Teddy Goldsmith 1972 helped popularise environmentalist 
discourse beyond academic and scientific circles as did the work of journalists 
like Michel Bosquet and Robert Jungk In 1972 a widely publicised study on The 
Limits to Growth was commissioned by the Club of Rome Its researchers used 
computer modelling of data on population growth and industrial production 
as well as the availability of food and nonrenewable resources to show how 
exponential growth in human consumption would quickly outstrip the planets 
ability to replenish itself Only a year later the books point was driven home 
forcefully by the oil crisis which demonstrated just how dependent European 
societies were on fossil fuels for energy As economic globalisation accelerated 
in the late 1960s and early 1970s environmental problems large and small that 
had once seemed to be primarily local in scope came to be perceived in relation 
to an interconnected global whole
By the 1970s the human relationship to the environment became increasingly 
politicised Though the upheavals among students and workers that had taken 
place across Europe around 1968 had had little to do with the environment 
they fostered an atmosphere of protest that was not bound by any single issue 
Feminism gay liberation solidarity with the socalled Third World human 
rights activism and environmental movements thus all developed in parallel 
in the decades that followed Paradoxically environmental activism was also 
helped by its seemingly apolitical nature which attracted the participation of 
people who were otherwise wary of being associated with left or rightwing 
politics
Among environmental issues nuclear energy became one of the most 
contentious particularly as Western European states backed the construction 
of a wave of new nuclear power stations during the 1970s Wherever nuclear 
facilities were proposed concerned citizens protested in opposition to them 
Over time local and regional antinuclear initiatives built up national and 
international networks as different groups came together to oppose risks 
associated with radioactivity accidents and the civil use of technology initially 
developed for military purposes In 1986 the Chernobyl accident underscored 
the dangers that activists had been opposing for more than a decade
In Eastern Europe environmentalism as a political movement developed 
somewhat later but drew on some of the same impulses that had animated 
protest in Western Europe After all both the communist and capitalist
