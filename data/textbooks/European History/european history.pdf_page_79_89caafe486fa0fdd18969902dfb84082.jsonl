The Berlin Wall erected in 1961 was for a long time the symbol of inhumanity 
and oppression par excellence Conversely the fall of the wall amid euphoric 
scenes in November 1989 has allowed it to serve as an icon of passage and a 
symbol of overcoming arbitrary borders
Derelict borders such as these stand out in landscapes that have long been 
the scenes of clashes between neighbouring countries and systems The Green 
Belt along the former GermanGerman border and the Berlin Wall Trail for 
pedestrians and cyclists are two of the bestknown examples The Rhine River 
is another emblematic one it has served as the site of European institutions in 
Strasbourg since the Second World War and more recently as the symbolic 
backdrop for a final tribute to a great European following the death of the 
former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 19302017
Considering that past borders have manifested in a variety of modes 
the concept of phantom borders is helpful It describes former territorial 
demarcations that seem to reemerge after periods of absence or which 
continue to structure spaces even after territorial shifts have led to their 
removal The abolished borders of continental empiresthe Habsburg 
Ottoman and German Empires but also the Soviet Empire and the border 
dividing Germany from 1949 to 1989continue to have a longlasting effect 
This can be seen today in architecture settlement patterns industrial heritage 
infrastructural legacies maps and statistics and other social practices Telling 
examples can be found in the electoral maps of many countries in eastcentral 
Europe and in this sense the case of Poland in the early twentieth century 
is anything but unique regional differences in voting patterns between the 
eastern and western parts of the country recall the interwar state borders sites 
of forced migration after the Second World War and even older boundaries of 
partitioned Poland from 1795 to 1918
Conclusion
Borders and boundaries remain as French historian Daniel Nordman has 
written a paradox in space The ambiguous Bornefrontire Boundary 
Marker sculpture carved in 1945 by the FrenchRomanian artist Constantin 
Brncui 18761957 also expresses this fundamental ambivalence showing 
four surfaces featuring pairs of human profiles chiselled facetoface in 
limestone apparently exchanging a kiss romantic encounter or frozen 
confrontation Borders can be both a frontline and a place of encounter a 
barrier and a pathway Amid the territorial conflicts of the interwar period 
the prominent French historian Lucien Febvre argued in his 1931 essay Le 
Rhin The Rhine that this famous border river represented both a coupure
