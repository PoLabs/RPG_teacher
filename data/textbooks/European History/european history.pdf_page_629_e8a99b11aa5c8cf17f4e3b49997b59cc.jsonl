their interests which took the form not only of workers associations but trade 
unions and political eg socialist social democratic parties In Germany 
for example the General German Workers Association was founded in 1863 
and the Social Democratic Workers Party in 1869 The trade unions and the 
political parties were already signs of a growing mass labour movement in 
Europe Moreover with the establishment of the First International in 1864 
the labour movement also became international The main political demand of 
labour was universal suffrage
The movements for changing the suffrage system also dealt with the 
distribution of wealth and income in society as censitary suffrage was a 
common phenomenon in all European countries before the First World War 
Censitary suffrage meant that the right to vote belonged to the citizens with 
a given level of incomemeasured in paid taxor wealth andor a specific 
educational level By the end of the nineteenth century there were real social 
debates about the prospect of extending the franchise to women and lower
income social groups due to quite a few mass demonstrations throughout the 
continent In some countries like Austria or Italy the property qualification 
for suffrage was decreased by the end of the nineteenth century and the range 
of voters widened slightly as a reaction to these popular demands
The nineteenth century witnessed only the beginning of the state social 
insurance system Prussia took the lead in introducing it at the initiative of 
Chancellor Otto von Bismarck 18151898 sickness insurance 1883 accident 
insurance 1884 oldage and invalidity insurance 1889 were introduced in 
the 1880s first for workers then for all employees The initiatives in Prussia

Despite the fact that these new measures hardly affected the distribution of 
wealth or income important progress was made in regulating labour law 
and introducing compulsory sickness and accident insurance prior to the 
development of the welfare state in the twentieth century
Intellectual Debates
The issues of economic inequality and the distribution of wealth in society 
came to the fore in the context of discussions about civil equality during the 
first half of the nineteenth century While the gradual implementation of 
the liberal and Enlightenment concept of equality before the law removed 
the traditional privileges of the elites and made parts of Europe more equal 
the economic liberalisation that was associated with this process also made 
economic inequality more visible by stripping away the traditional checks 
on wealth accumulation and trade such as guilds duties tolls and other 
regulations Initially theories about the distribution of income among social 
classes and individuals developed predominantly in the discipline of political
