Protestant diasporas as well as in Orthodox Old Believer communities in 
Russia The fact that these features were shared by groups with completely 
different religious convictions and practices suggests that they did not flow from 
any specific theology as suggested among others by the German sociologist 
Max Weber 18641920 in his Protestant Ethic Thesis according to which 
the uncertainty of salvation in Protestant dogma drove many communities 
to embrace values of hard work asceticism and profitability Rather these 
features often stemmed from their specific diasporic situation a precarious 
existence that is within a foreign and often hostile society usually coupled 
with harsh financial conditions forced diaspora communities to organise 
themselves efficiently to fully exploit their members potential to develop 
new economic skills and to maintain bonds with coreligionists farther afield
The Iberian Peninsula Crossroads of Religious Migrations 
and Expulsions
In Portugal after the massive influx of Sephardic Jews from Spain and the 
forced conversion of all Portuguese Jews in 1497 these socalled New 
Christians lived relatively quietly until 1536 when the Portuguese Inquisition 
was established In the second half of the sixteenth century many New 
Christians who were accused of being cryptoJewish ie practising Judaism 
in secret while outwardly presenting themselves as Christians fled to Spain 
Their subsequent persecution both in Spain and Portugal created a major 
diaspora in Europe and the New World generating among the converts a 
feeling of belonging to the nation meaning the Sephardic diaspora Thus 
from the beginning of the Atlantic expansion New Christian families served 
to populate the overseas Iberian empires as early as the end of the fifteenth 
century Jewish children had been sent to populate the African island of Sao 
Tome They also underpinned the creation of Atlantic networks that allowed 
them to take advantage of commercial opportunities opened up by Iberian 
overseas expansion Although New Christians and Jews were formally 
prohibited from emigrating to the Portuguese and Spanish Americas the 
Crown implemented formulae which made it easier for them to emigrate or 
find other ways to escape these restrictions Consequently New Christians 
a great majority of them of Portuguese origin established themselves in the 
Caribbean Mexico Brazil and Peru where they played an important role 
in businesses such as sugar plantations the slave trade or mining In these 
places some of them continued practicing Judaism while others married into 
Catholic families
Another important Iberian diaspora is that of the Moriscos These 
descendants of the Muslim alAndalus settlers were forced to convert to 
Christianity in 1492 as a result of the socalled Reconquista the reconquest
