acceleration of the reconfiguration of European peripheries thus also occurred 
on a global scale The year 1869 proved to be crucial in this regard The Suez 
Canal was opened significantly reducing time and costs for global trade In 
the same year the Transcontinental Railway started operating in the United 
States not only connecting northern America but also serving as a shortcut for 
the journey from Russias Far Eastern regions to its capital St Petersburg In this 
process easier and cheaper communication allowed investment possibilities 
to proliferate while quick access to information set profit expectations higher 
Trains and the Reorganisation of European Peripheries
But how did this success story look from Europes imperial peripheries 
The history of the railway networks in the three peripheral empires show 
a very different history from that of Western Europe Hungary part of the 
Habsburg Empire in the nineteenth century did not have an advantageous 
transportation infrastructure Like most other parts of the Habsburg Empire 
it was landlocked On the eve of the nineteenth century it was only the wars 
of the First French Republic that gave Hungary a chance to sell its grain 
surpluses Western urbanisation impressed that there was a demand for 
grain Water regulationpartly regulating waterways but also reclaiming 
arable landwas a new aspiration for Hungarian landowners Railways were 
built to connect the large plains of the country to commodity markets Both 
developments demanded capital imports and internal accumulation Not too 
long after the middle of the nineteenth century the worlds largest capacity 
for steam milling emerged in the commercial capital of the country the city 
of Pest Yet declining transportation costs had made US grain so cheap in 
Europe that Hungarian exports could not compete outside the borders of the 
Habsburg Empire Agriculture could not develop as the countrys reformers 
had imagined At the same time news about the rising demand for labour 
in the US spread rapidly all over the country and at the turn of the century 
migration to the other side of the Atlantic grew 
The Russian experience was differentat least partly When the Russian 
Empire entered the railway age in the middle of the nineteenth century the 
tracks were a representation of imperial pride and power A first line opened 
in 1837 operated only between the capital St Petersburg and the Tsarist 
residence of Tsarskoye Seloconnecting only the very centres of political 
power Things changed with the construction of the MoscowSt Petersburg 
line which opened in 1851 This ambitious project was widely regarded as a 
major step to overcoming Russias illness of space as the historian Roland 
Cvetkovski has called it and to territorialise the empire Advocates of the 
empires speedy railroadification pointed not only to its political benefits
