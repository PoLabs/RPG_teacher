211 Demographic Change in Early 
Modern History ca 15001800
Sarah Carmichael and Andrs Vadas
Introduction
Most scholars agree that the European region saw its population almost double 
between 1500 and 1750 followed by an even greater surge in population levels 
as Europe entered the era of the industrial revolution This postBlack Death 
period was one of uneven improvements in welfare and the intensification of 
land use which fed ever larger numbers of mouths The wealth from European 
colonies also encouraged many to work longer hours so that they could afford 
small luxuries But at the end of this periodin the time of British economic 
theorist and cleric Thomas Robert Malthus 17661834worries about how 
resources would keep up with rising population levels became ever more 
prominent Disease malnutrition and the interplay of the two could easily 
tip populations over into periods of high mortality Yet many historians are 
critical of the assumption made by many presentday journalists that because 
average life expectancy in the early modern period was around thirty to thirty
five years of age no one lived to see old age In fact for individuals who made 
it through their first five years of life the outlook was quite decent In general 
those who lived into their early twenties could expect to live to their sixties 
approximately with some variation depending on time and place This 
chapter sketches early modern developments in fertility and mortality framed 
around Malthuss model to give the reader a general sense of demographic 
trends across Europe First however it discusses sources and methodological 
problems in the study of these facets of early modern society
Types of Sources and Methodological Problems 
The early modern period is the earliest for which there is relatively precise data 
on demographic behaviour and population change for some parts of Europe
