As far as Western Europe was concerned intercultural issues underwent 
significant changes after the Second World War as for the first time in modern 
history Europe became a continent of mass inward migration see the chapters 
on Demographic Change and Migration in the twentieth century In the 
wake of decolonisation an everlarger number of nonEuropeans arrived from 
former colonies to countries like Britain France and the Netherlands In the 
economic boom that began in the 1950s large numbers of socalled guest 
workersinitially from Italy Spain and Portugal then increasingly from 
Turkey and Yugoslaviawere recruited for employment in Germany Austria 
and Switzerland By the 1990s immigration had greatly diversified in terms of 
the motivations of migrants and their countries of origin With the emergence 
of the European Community later the European Union intraEuropean 
migration began to increase as well These new patterns of migration raised 
new kinds of concerns Cultural differences manifest in residential spatial 
patterns such as segregation and new issues of cultural integration began to 
define discourses on interethnic relations 
The collapse of state socialist regimes in 19891990 put the question of 
minorities on a new footing Democratically elected parliaments and post1990 
governments sought to create legal frameworks in which minority rights were 
respected and observed In many cases these new laws were shaped by the 
European Union which expanded to include the Visegrd countries Poland 
the Czech Republic Slovakia and Hungary the Baltic states Estonia Latvia 
and Lithuania as well as Slovenia in 2004 followed by Romania and Croatia 
three years later Minorities in these countries thus obtained greater legal 
protections However populist and rightwing nationalist parties claiming to 
represent the entire nation meaning in fact the majority ethnic population 
also pursued aggressive policies against minorities in this period In some 
countries unbridled nationalism led to increasing tensions and discrimination 
in everyday life 
In the aftermath of the Cold War Europe was also reminded of the dangers 
of violent interethnic conflict The breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 and the 
subsequent wars in Croatia 19911995 BosniaHerzegovina 19921995 
and Kosovo 19981999 represented the first largescale interethnic wars on 
European soil since the Second World War With the fall of the Muslim enclave 
of Srebrenica Bosnia on 11 July 1995 the war even led to the first post1945 
genocide in Europe against the Bosniak people These conflicts shared many 
similarities with those earlier in the century when the disintegration of 
multiethnic states had led to struggles between competing ethnic groups for 
sovereignty over their territory
