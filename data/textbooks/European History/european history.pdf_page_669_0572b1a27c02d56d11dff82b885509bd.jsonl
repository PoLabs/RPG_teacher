53 PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
649
The second Kcyclewhich began in the USA after 1939became general 
with the end of the war For Europe the first decades following the Second 
World War after the critical years of 19451947 stand out as a unique episode 
they witnessed the most rapid economic growth of the twentieth century 
Mass production and mass consumption a combination sometimes called 
Fordist capitalism spread throughout Western Europe This long wave of 
economic expansion in Western Europe was initially fuelled by the Marshall 
Plan and took place under a new system of international economic relations 
established at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 In the context of the 
Cold War 19471991 states carried out very active interventions that directly 
affected economic performance on both sides of the Iron Curtain In the 
Western European economies full employment and stable growth became 
governmental aims In the communist countries states followed the Soviet 
modernisation model aiming at accelerated growth 
Between 1968 and 1973 the basic elements that had enabled the long post
war period of European growth were shaken by a confluence of different factors 
On the one hand economic relations between the USA and Western European 
countries changed because of the industrial progress of the latter and the 
Bretton Woods settlement was threatened On the other hand the excolonial 
countries denounced the status quo of international trade and attempted to 
transform it through cartels of producing countries In 1973 coinciding with 
the Yom Kippur War oil producers managed to fix higher prices The oil 
crisis shook the economies of all petroleumimporting countries particularly 
Europe In Western Europe the crisis hit societies where full employment had 
been achieved and the labour movement was strong and where many sectors 
had oligopolistic traits consequently income redistribution produced by the 
oilshock multiplied inflationary pressures further enabled by lax monetary 
policies 
The downswing of the second Kcycle was followed after 19841991 by 
the beginning of a third cycle The upswing in the 1990s took place in a new 
economic and political environment shaped by globalisation the end of the 
Cold War and the expansion of the European Economic Community EEC 
later the European Union EU all under the doctrinal hegemony of what 
was very often called neoliberalism The new crisis after 2007 shattered this 
predominance and might have opened a new phase in economic policies
Capitalist Production
The broadest structural changes in production in the capitalist countries during 
the twentieth century were first an enormous increase in both agricultural and 
industrial production and second a shift in the workforce from agriculture
