For most of the nineteenth century Siemens  Halske was a family firm

embedded in the social fabric of entrepreneurial families
Conclusion
The nineteenth century was the age of industrial capitalism in all Europe when 
traditional business elements eg guilds disappeared from economic life and 
were replaced by modern capitalist institutions eg modern corporations

However in a globalising economy and together with the developing big

businesses and entrepreneurial families continued to play a significant role in 
the European economy
