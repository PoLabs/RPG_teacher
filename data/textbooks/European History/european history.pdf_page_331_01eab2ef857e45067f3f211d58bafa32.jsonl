32 EMPIRE AND COLONIALISM

discussed a white mans burden whereby indigenous people would have 
to be carried by their European counterparts along the road of civilisation
Interventions were justified by claiming a need to offer protection from 
barbarism For instance in the second half of the nineteenth century slavery 
within Africa characterised as a sign of African barbarity was used as a 
principal justification for European colonial penetration on the continent
despite the hypocritical participation of Europeans in the ongoing illegal 
slave trade between the continent and the Americas
One chief agent of cultural imperialism and the dissemination of colonial 
ideologies were missionary societies which expanded significantly from the 
late eighteenth century onwards Both Catholic and Protestant missionaries 
were deeply interested in religiosity and converting indigenous peoples 
of all faiths to Christianity but they were not simply aiming at a religious 
transformation The transformation they sought would also impose widescale 
cultural shifts from the adoption of Western forms of dress and clothing 
to the reformation of marriage and sexuality to reformed childbearing and 
childrearing practices Almost every element of indigenous life and practice 
was considered appropriate for reconstruction from the missionarys 
perspective Missionary organisations were formed even in countries without 
significant overseas empires such as Switzerland and Norway In some places 
such as southern Africa and India there was competition for converts between 
missionaries of different denominations
Sometimes missionaries cooperated with and indeed benefited from formal 
colonial rule Certainly many were seen as imperial agents by indigenous 
peoplesuch as in the runup to the 18571858 Indian Rebellion when 
perceived Christianisation was one factor that led to anticolonial resistance 
However at other moments the relationship between missionaries and 
the colonial state was hostile Again we can see this in British India where 
missionaries were sometimes frowned upon and sometimes banned by colonial 
officials concerned that they would generate agitation The intertwined nature 
of missionary cultural imperialism and other forms of colonial activity is clear 
when we consider particular individuals who traversed neat distinctions 
between these categories of action This can be seen in the example of David 
Livingstone one of the nineteenth centurys most famous missionaries who 
originally started working as a missionary for the London Missionary Society 
but whose explorations across southern Africa also attracted the attention of 
other agents of imperialism such as geographerswith his findings widely 
lauded and later funded by the Royal Geographical Society Livingstone 
became a celebrity figure in his own lifetime and subsequently became a key 
figure in the cultural memory of imperialism in Africa immortalised in many 
statues and imperial culture
