between amateurism and professionalism took place within and between 
European countries with different factions defending different stances on 
sport and its purposes On the one hand amateursusually from the upper 
and middle classessaw sport as a leisure activity played for personal 
satisfaction and a love of the game They played sports intensely but strove to 
show that they did not take their outcome too seriously emphasising effortless 
achievement and values such as fair play and characterbuilding There was 
also an interclass amateur associationism with highly regulated competitions 
in which each association represented a local regional or national identity
in these contexts the result clearly mattered On the other hand outside of 
these amateur competitions professionals defended the right to compete for 
cash rewards 
Cycling which developed as a leisure and sporting pursuit from the 1860s 
is a good example of the struggle between amateurism and professionalism 
In particular from the 1890s onwards cycling engendered transnational flows 
of ideas and practices as racers crossed borders with increasing swiftness 
However each European country regulated cycling competitions according 
to their own nations prevalent position on the question of amateurism versus 
professionalism with different paths emerging While the cycling associations 
established in Great Britain the Netherlands Spain and Germany during 
the early 1880s resolutely adopted amateurism in competitions in Italy and 
especially France racing for monetary reward soon became the dominant mode 
of competition Countries like Belgium went for a middle ground between the 
two stances
