State George C Marshall 18801959 The Marshall Plan was a system of 
economic aid that ran from 19481951 and was worth 124 billion USD about 
four percent of the annual average US GDP at the time The aid was not a 
loan and the countries that signed up to it did not have to repay any money 
They were required however to rebuild reorganise and modernise their 
economies and financial systems along the lines of the American model They 
also agreed to cooperate closely in terms of financial and trade flows The 
aid was nominally offered to the whole of Europe but Soviet leader Joseph 
Stalin 18781953 banned Eastern European satellite states from participation 
While opinion is divided among economic historians about the final impact 
of the Marshall Plan in the recovery of the wartorn European economy it 
did harmonise the continents markets outside the Iron Curtain and created 
incentives to establish a free market based on multilateralism Under the 
given circumstances this system gave an advantage to countries that could 
supply trade with generally accepted currency viz the US While this made 
the American form of business organisation including a managerialisation 
separation of ownership and leadership of enterprises more attractive for 
European business actors family firms uniting ownership and leadership 
remained a characteristic element of the European business environment 
The Appeal of State Intervention in the West 
Although it is common to refer to the postwar partystate countries in the Soviet 
sphere with planned command and control economies as socialist Western 
European countries also found some forms of state intervention attractive 
This could include actual nationalisation as was the case in Britain with the 
coal mines in the case of industry the railways in the case of material services 
and the health insurance system in the case of nonmaterial services In France 
several large banks and companies were deemed to have been collaborators 
during the war and were nationalised after 1945 on those grounds Elsewhere 
state intervention meant state planningnot instructional planningas 
in France and the Netherlands The countries of the Iberian Peninsula that 
remained neutral during the war as well as Italy were characterised by the 
survival of corporatism The freemarket system was most prominent in West 
Germany where the system of state intervention was gradually replaced 
after the war by a system of socalled ordoliberalism based on market order 
According to ordoliberalist thought the state should not only create the 
necessary conditions for a freemarket economic order with competition but 
also maintain it In ordoliberalism the preservation and safeguarding of free 
competition is served by the creation of a legal framework by the state
