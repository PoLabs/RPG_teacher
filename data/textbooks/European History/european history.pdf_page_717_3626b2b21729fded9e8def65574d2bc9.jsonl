Nevertheless the confessionalisation of European populations was never 
complete In the first decades of the Reformation many people were hesitant 
their adherence to a particular confession often incomplete or based on a 
vague knowledge of doctrinal differences indeed confessional boundaries 
were still fluid in this period of heated theological debate Once confessional 
identities were more firmly established in the second half of the sixteenth 
century diversity of belief remained a reality in many places Minorities

as in France after certain edicts of pacification and then from the signing of the 
Edict of Nantes until its revocation 15981685solutions had to be found

of several towns and villages in the Rhone Valley and in southwestern France
