covered long distances were unlike other sports impossible to watch in 
person For this reason some newspapers became race organisers with the 
aim of increasing their sales and earning more money from advertising In 
fact the Tour de France 1903which revolutionised competitive racing 
worldwideand later the Tour of Italy 1909 and Tour of Spain 1935 were 
created respectively by the newspapers LAuto La Gazzetta dello Sport and 
Informaciones successfully seeking to profit from the commodification and 
commercialisation of sport
Conclusion
During the nineteenth century leisure evolved as a more or less clearly 
defined concept Developing in close connection to a reframing of work and 
labour in an age of industrialisation and modernity leisure emerged as a 
discrete unit of time Leisure was more than nonwork rest or recreation The 
leisure system did not appear overnight in Europe it was the product of deep 
social economic political and even cultural transformations From a macro 
perspective the nineteenth century could be seen as a formative period for 
the modern time regime But from a micro perspective we can observe that 
the modern condition of time and hence leisure emerged in different places 
different periods and even different forms But these diverse manifestations 
of modern time transcended common categories and binary distinctions of 
urbanrural or industrialagrarian
Leisure and sports are an important part of the history of the nineteenth 
century Leisure activities and sports did not take place in a vacuum leisure 
was coupled with other political social cultural and economic trends like 
urban planning and entertainment social movements and nationalism 
professionalism the commodification of leisure and sports and much more 
Analysing the constitution of modern temporalities from the perspective of 
leisure and sports poses fundamental questions how and by whom were 
leisure and its practices conceptualisedand for what purpose When and 
where did specific forms of leisure like sports appear And especially how 
did people and groups make sense of their free time By asking questions 
like these one can identify core mechanisms characterising nineteenthcentury 
societies and advance to a fundamental understanding of the modern world
