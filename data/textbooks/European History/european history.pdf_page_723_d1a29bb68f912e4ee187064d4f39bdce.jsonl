than this narrative suggests The fragmentation of Protestantism due to intra
confessional theological and political disagreements is a wellknown element 
of the familiar narrative but as we have seen in this chapter Catholicism 
harboured a plurality of strands as well and confessional identities continued 
to be unstable even after the establishment of confessional formularies of faith 
in the second half of the sixteenth century Apart from the Christian story 
however Europe was also populated by nonChristians whose positions in 
society were contested but whose economic or military power remained a 
force to be reckoned with Persecution by the Inquisition is one part of the 
story but Realpolitik aimed at coexistence was ubiquitous even if such politics 
were not yet informed by positive philosophies of tolerance and expressions 
of epistemic humility that were formulated during the eighteenth century 
Much has been made of secularisation in this century of Enlightenment but 
it should be underscored that religion continued to be a major political force 
and that the number of people who claimed to be atheist was very small
