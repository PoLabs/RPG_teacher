Eastern Europe played a dominant role in the preservation of extremely low 
levels of income inequality in those countries throughout the 1970s and 1980s 
While wealth and income inequalities were particularly high in Eastern 
Europe before the Second World War the triumph of the Red Army and the 
consequences of the Yalta Conference opened a new chapter in the history 
of these countries They became part of the SovietEastern Bloc and adopted 
Soviet models of political and economic governance including the dictatorship 
of the proletariat and the planned economy Stalinist industrialisation after the 
Second World War was accompanied by a radical redistribution of wealth 
The abolishment of private ownership of the means of production rendered 
income almost dependent on earnings where a radical levelling could also be 
observed However labour unrest showed that even workers were not satisfied 
with the regime revolts broke out in the German Democratic Republic in 
Poland and in Hungary where the Revolution of 1956 was led by young 
workers and intellectuals To consolidate their political power communist 
parties sought to win over the working classes through material concessions 
The promise of a socialist welfare state was an attractive slogan after the lean 
years of high Stalinism in the 1950s There were concrete improvements as a 
result of this new policy towards labour the increase of workers wages the 
construction of new blocks of flats providing better housing the building of 
nurseries kindergartens and the provision of free education and healthcare 
However statistics showed that educational inequalities continued to exist as 
the intelligentsia invested more in its cultural reproduction
The steep decrease in income inequality between 1930 and 1960 seems to 
be indeed a universal pattern for the vast majority of European economies 
and from the 1970s the trend is again towards rising inequality The eventual 
collapse of state socialism in 19891990 dismantled the Iron Curtain With 
the collapse of state socialism wealth and income inequalities rose quickly in 
Eastern Europe too The collapse of traditional industries was accompanied 
by very high levels of unemployment and the impoverishment of masses of 
people On the other hand technocratic and financial elites accumulated such 
wealth that these elite groups could catch up as individuals with the middle 
classes of the advanced western countries The numbers tell the story the 
income share of the top one percent of the population in Poland dropped from 
fifteen percent in 1935 to ten percent during the Second World War and fell to 
almost three percent during the period of high Stalinism Between 1990 and 
1995 the income share of the top one percent rose back to twelve percent and 
after a short period of stabilisation it rose again to fifteen percent by 2008 These 
trends triggered new challenges to the democratic order in Eastern Europe 
as many people were disappointed with the consequences of a neoliberal
