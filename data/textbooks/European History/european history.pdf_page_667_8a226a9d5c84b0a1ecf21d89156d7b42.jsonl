Introduction
Summing up the performance of the European economies in terms of production 
and consumption between the First World War and the first general economic 
crisis of the twentyfirst century 2007 is not an easy task The nationstates of 
the continent have not followed a unified trend in terms of overall economic 
performanceespecially GDP growth Trends have varied considerably over 
certain periods not least because after 1917 two economic systems coexisted 
in Europe and between 1947 and 1991 the Soviet system was imposed on 
many countries Most comparisons are done between nationalstates but if we 
take regions as our unit of analysis instead we see that the absolute distance 
between the poorest and the richest regions in Europe has increased over the 
twentieth century although economic disparities have declined in relative 
terms
However as this chapter shows there have also been many common traits 
in the history of production and consumption across the continent Despite 
chronological disparities productive cycles have followed similar trends 
Sectoral organisation of different economies has followed common patterns 
with different rhythms the decline in terms of output and the share of 
employment dedicated to the agricultural production the gradual rise until 
the 1970s of industrial production and the constant growth of the service 
sector which since the 1970s has become the largest sector in most European 
countries
