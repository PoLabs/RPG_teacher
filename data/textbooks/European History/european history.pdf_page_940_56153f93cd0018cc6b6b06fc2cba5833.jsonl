Uses of the Past to Improve the Image of a Stigmatised 
Country Humanist Histories of the Heretic Czech Lands
The historiography of the Czech Lands meaning the Lands of the Bohemian 
Crown Corona Regni Bohemiae a conglomerate of territories which in the 
beginning of the sixteenth century included Bohemia Moravia Silesia and 
Upper and Lower Lusatia is a good example of how humanist intellectuals 
dealt with history The writing of the history of the Czech Lands by humanists 
between the second half of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the seventeenth 
centuries was influenced by at least two important factors first this part 
of Central Europe could not build on the classical tradition because it had 
not been part of the ancient Roman Empire which contributed to a sense 
of inferiority Second the Kingdom of Bohemia was discredited in the eyes 
of Catholic Europe as an heretical land because of the Hussite movement 
a ProtoProtestant Christian group that followed the teachings of reformer 
Jan Hus 13721415 while the other Crown lands maintained the Roman 
Catholic faith The goal of the humanist intellectuals was thus to improve the 
countrys image and to invent a connection with antiquity Religious notions 
were intrinsically bound up with notions of ethnicity with the religion being 
particularly prominent in defining the Czech people who are referred to as the 
populus natio or gens in period sources since the late Middle Ages The 
basic question was who were the good proper Czechs Catholics or Hussites
Humanist historians from Bohemia were usually ethnic Czechs of various 
denominations including Catholics members of the Unity of Brethren a 
Protestant church founded in the midfifteenth century and following more 
radical streams of Hussitism as well as Utraquists the denomination which 
resulted from Hus teachings representing something of a middle ground 
between the two From the wealth of historical works written in Bohemia in 
the humanist era two examples can demonstrate some of these trends the 
work of conservative Utraquist preacher Bohuslav Blejovsk ca 14801555 
published in Nuremberg in 1537 under the title Kronika esk zpsob vry 
kesansk pod oboj zpsobou tla a krve Pna Jezu Krista i tak pod jednou v sob 
obsahuje Czech Chronicle containing the way of Christian faith of communion under 
both kinds and the similarly titled Kronika esk Czech Chronicle published 
in 1541 a book on Czech history coming from aristocratic Catholic circles 
written by the Catholic priest Vclav Hjek of Liboany  1553
