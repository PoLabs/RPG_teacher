in the intellectual spheres of culture and politics Popular culture emerged 
as a hybrid form situated between elite and folk culture with an important 
element of consumerism to which workers were attracted in the periods of 
economic growth 
Generally during the twentieth century one can also observe the 
convergence of workers culture with that of the middle classes Ideologically 
motivated critiques described these processes as embourgeoisement with a 
new class category called the new petty bourgeoisie and formed of supervisors 
and highly skilled workers Different cultural changes among workers can 
nevertheless be observed according to generational divisions as well as the 
geographical division between Western and Northern Europe on one side 
and Eastern and Southern Europe on the other An illustrative model of these 
processes can be provided through the representation of workers in two 
movies depicting different workingclass experiences first in half of twentieth 
century and second at its end The film Bicycle Thieves 1948 presented a social 
critique through the aesthetics of Italian neorealism Its story centres around 
a longterm unemployed worker from Rome who suddenly receives a job 
offer with the condition of owning a bicycle as a means of transport to work 
The bicycle is eventually stolen and the drama of the worker and his son 
searching for it in the streets of Rome underlines the critical necessity of work 
as a means of survival in the city Shot almost fifty years later the British film 
The Full Monty 1997 presents a similar picture of psychological suffering due 
to unemployment The context here is deindustrialised northern England and 
the city of Sheffield in particular A group of former colleagues from a closed 
steelworks copes with their boredom and threatened masculinity due to the 
loss of their roles as breadwinners They eventually find a way out of their 
isolation and depression by performing male striptease 
The evolution of workingclass cultures in the second half of the 
twentieth century was due to an increased share of university students from 
workingclass environments particularly from the mid1960s onwards This 
phenomenon was evident in most European countries and found its expression 
in particular in the movements active in the long 1968 in France Germany 
Italy Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia In the following two decades close 
cooperation and connection between students and workers movements 
followed in other European countries for instance in the Athens Polytechnic 
Uprising in November 1973 What young workers shared with students was 
an emphasis on culture as a political expression This focus manifested itself 
in different individualised but collectively celebrated lifestyles particularly 
related to protest and rock music Certain factions of workers were however 
not too enthusiastic about cooperation with academics due to their different 
work roles This tension was illustrated in the deployment of industrial
