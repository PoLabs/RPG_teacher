641 Generations and Lifecycles in 
Early Modern History ca 15001800
Feike Dietz with Stefan B Kirmse
Introduction
In the early modern period life stagesthe age ranges into which a human 
life is dividedwere approached as natural rather than social phenomena 
which determined the qualities and behaviour that could be expected from 
people of different ages A particular interest in the life stages of childhood 
and youth developed from the sixteenth century onwards How were young 
people and their progression from infancy to adulthood imagined and what 
behaviour was expected of them What did these expectations have to do with 
existing power relations in early modern society In addition to answering 
these questions this chapter also suggests that older particularly male and 
upperclass youths possessed some space to make their own subculture
which sometimes caused generational conflicts with people at different stages 
of life
The Ladder of Life
