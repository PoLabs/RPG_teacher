moved yet it also created the conditions in which the channelling of migration 
came to be seen as a collective European responsibility 
Migration in the Age of Territoriality The First World War 
and the Interwar Period
The historian Charles Maier has identified the period between 1870 and 1950 as 
the age of territoriality In this period European states defined their mutual 
relations increasingly in terms of competition both on the continent and in 
imperial conquest beyond Europe In this context migration transformed from 
a nineteenthcentury solution to the Malthusian fear of overpopulation into a 
threat to national strength both because enterprising people left the territory 
of the state and because other people considered dangerous or unfit came in
This Darwinian view of the relationship between states was one of the 
causes of the First World War which in itself was an important impetus for 
the dislocation of people in Europe The scale of this wargeographically 
in terms of the total mobilisation of the population and in the extent of 
bloodshedbrought about a massive movement of people who tried to flee 
from their homes Around 500000 people from Eastern Prussia and 800000 
from Galicia fled from the Russian Army while the counteroffensive of the 
Central Powers caused many Russians to flee to the east contributing to a total 
of seven million refugees in 1917 
The end of the First World War initiated yet another wave of forced 
migration During the collapse of the Russian Empire the Russian Revolution 
and subsequent Civil War some two million people tried to escape from 
violence fleeing to the West to Berlin Paris and also the United States The 
defeat of the Central Powers resulted in the forced migration of some one 
million German nationals and Hungarians to Germany This was not only 
a consequence of the war but also of the following peace treaties which 
reinforced this process of ethnic sortition The underlying principle of national 
selfdetermination informed the creation of new nation states each of which 
claimed the right to define the parameters of national identity and to insist on 
the removal of people who did not fit this definition Often this took the form 
of deliberate population exchanges
These transfers were a prelude to the migration restrictions that states 
came to impose over the course of the 1920s These restrictions were not only 
motivated by racist ideas of cultural homogeneity but often supported by 
trade unions opposed to the import of cheap labour Such ideas informed the 
United States Immigration Act of 1924 which imposed quotas that severely 
limited the immigration of Eastern and Southern Europeans as well as Asians 
But within Europe as well states closed their borders to foreigners In many
