socialism and communism on the other persisted through the 1950s Such 
Marxist revisionist tendencies manifested in the upheavals in the German 
Democratic Republic in 1953 in reform attempts in Poland and Hungary in 
1956 and in the Czechoslovak Prague Spring in 1968 The Soviet leadership 
under Khrushchev and later under Brezhnev realised that any profound 
reform of the Stalinist model could unleash uncontrollable social forces Until 
the 1980s the ruling communist ideology in Soviet bloc countries maintained 
its dogmatic and rigid nature When the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev 
introduced his own reform programme perestroika this ideology quickly 
eroded and as a result the political order lost its ground In 1989 socialist 
dictatorships broke down all over Eastern Europe and soon thereafter in the 
USSR as well
After 1945 communism in Western Europe quickly became marginalised 
Although the communist parties of France and Italy continued to mobilise 
mass support they shared the fate of communists in other parts of Western 
Europeexcluded from political power but also deprived of most of their 
electoral support After the demise of liberalism and the destruction of

personalities of party leaders became crucial for electoral success
In the course of the 1950s the state of political contestation in Western

this kind of political pragmatism focused on the delivery of material wealth 
in exchange for political acquiescence was unmasked as slavish consumerism 
and technocratic rule This made the end of ideology nothing more than the 
depletion of political imagination
At the end of the 1960s the understanding that liberal democracy and the 
welfare state were in fact the cause of political apathy and materialist self
interest provoked the rise of an ideological counterculture that combined 
individual liberation with new forms of solidarity This took shape in a return 
to Marxism but this time with a twist the iron certainties of the Marxist 
analysis that had encased the unquestionable rule of communist parties in 
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was replaced by the inspiration of the 
early writings of Marx This rediscovery of Marxism inspired some people 
to enter the communist parties only to discover that the Stalinist cadres 
were unwilling to accept their new agenda A similar experience plagued the
