which had belonged to the feudal aristocracy and the Catholic Church was 
soon condemned as a counterrevolutionary act of vandalism by Abb Grgoire 
while the plundered symbols of feudalism and the ancien rgime were reclaimed 
and redefined as national property created by the genius of the French nation 
The transfer of artwork and monuments from the countries occupied by the 
revolutionary armies to French museums was another formative experience 
The calls for the repatriation of monuments after the end of the Napoleonic 
Wars reflected a growing sense among European cultural elites that the 
remnants of the past belonged first and foremost to a particular nation and 
were bound to their country of origin even if they embodied common heritage 
of the European civilisation as well
Increasingly systematic measures of heritage preservation were prompted 
by growing concerns about the irreversible loss of monuments or dispersal of 
national heritage due to acquisition by private collectors The century thus saw 
the formation of networks of heritage inspectors the making of monument 
registries and the enactment of protection laws Measures like these were 
normally the consequence of both state action and pressure from below though 
in some countries such as France the state played a stronger role than in other 
countries such as Germany in which voluntary associations and professionals 
were arguably a more important factor In the Austrian Empire for instance 
the Imperial and Royal Central Commission for the Study and Preservation of 
Artistic and Historical Monuments K K ZentralKommission fr Erforschung 
und Erhaltung der Kunst und Historischen Denkmale was established in 1850 and 
was soon followed by a network of stateappointed conservators who oversaw 
several districts Still the system was deemed insufficient partly because 
the protection measures were not sufficiently enforced Some of the Czech 
advocates of preservation therefore appealed to the Bohemian Diet and the 
selfgovernmental bodies of the counties to take initiative in heritage protection 
as well particularly in spreading an awareness of it among municipalities 
and individuals Many regional and municipal museums which from the 
1880s increased in number throughout the Czech Lands were instrumental 
in broadening the protection measures At the turn of the century a robust 
preservationist movement was triggered by the controversial clearance of the 
historical heart of Prague This clearance was especially focused on the former 
Jewish Ghetto and gave birth to the influential Club for Old Prague which 
soon launched branches in other Bohemian cities and towns In Czech society 
as elsewhere in Europe the preservation of historical monuments and heritage 
became an integral part of nationbuilding and an indicator of a countrys or a 
nations cultural advancement
Newly formed nations constructed themselves around notions of 
continuity rootedness and cultural distinction In seeking out such symbols
