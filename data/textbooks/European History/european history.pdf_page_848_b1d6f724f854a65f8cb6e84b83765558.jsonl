On the one hand Sades radical atheism and individualism as well as his 
plea for violent sexuality could not be further from the seventeenthcentury 
radical religious sects that emphasised true Christianity and moral decency or 
indeed the mode of civil and communal living espoused by Utopians On the 
other hand both Sade and these sects show how gender sexuality religion 
and politics are inextricably connected in utopian radical thought which 
offered new ways to envision society but also transgressive modes of living 
in practice Mores Utopia the concomitant notion of utopianism and the 
religious upheaval in early modern Europe sparked opportunities to imagine 
a different society The influence of these early modern utopian experiments 
endured into the nineteenth century when socialist authors looked to radical 
religious groups and to Mores Utopia as examples of a real sense of community 
and as precursors of modern socialism In turn Sades transgressive texts have 
influenced twentiethcentury philosophers discussions of links between the 
body sexuality and power and have also impacted the cultural and sexual 
politics of the late twentieth century especially the sexual revolutions 
recognition of different forms of sexuality Early modern utopian and 
transgressive experiments are thus important precursors to modern political 
theory and cultural practices
Conclusion
In a period of radical religious upheaval utopian thought provided a means 
to envision society in a radically new way particularly with regard to religion 
the relationship between men and women and shared property Thomas 
Mores Utopia was a jokey book and ironic thought experiment on what an 
ideal society might look like But in spiritual sects communal living and 
radical religious ideas utopianism became a basis for practical living These 
early modern texts and living experiments would inspire modern socialists 
and freethinkers even to the present day
