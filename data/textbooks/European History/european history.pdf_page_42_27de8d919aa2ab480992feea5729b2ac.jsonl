based on the idea of universal association the motto of their new religion that 
sought to attain solidarity far beyond European borders both in industrial 
political and mystical terms Examples are the journal LEuropen founded 
by the French politician Phillippe Buchez 17961865 in which he appealed 
for a European federation in 1831 or the idea of the Mediterranean 
System formulated by the French economist Michel Chevalier 18061879 
in 1832 an economic and industrial project that would link West and East 
through the Mediterranean Sea Other utopian socialists like the French 
writer Gustave dEichthal 18041886 and the French philosopher Victor 
Considerant 18081893 published their plans for a European federation in 
1840 This coincided with the diplomatic Oriental Crisis itself a consequence 
of the EgyptianOttoman war and the confrontational positions taken up by 
the powers in Europe where once again France risked an armed conflict All 
these authors claimed that after the Greek War of Independence of the 1820s 
had brought Greece back to the European community a perpetual peace 
could not be attained strictly within European borders They broadened the 
mental map of Europe towards the East even proposing Jerusalem Istanbul 
or Alexandria as capital cities for the future European federation where the 
General Congress of Nations would sit Meanwhile the Spanish writer Juan 
Francisco Sieriz 17781857 published the first European Constitution in 
Paris in 1839 an attempt to shape the juridical framework of a future European 
union Despite their differences which encompassed disagreements about 
European institutions and different ideas about the membership of Britain or 
Russia all these projects shared the idea of a unity based on the independence 
of nations and the principles of democracy and representation social cohesion 
and economic development 
Conclusion
In the aftermath of the French Revolution different and often opposing ideas 
of Europe thrived on the continent Older notions of European civilisation 
survived or were adapted to the new times Meanwhile contemporary 
developments such as industrialisation and the rise of nationalist movements 
as well as political revolutions had produced new ideas like a United States of 
Europe The development of the modern political spectrum of conservatism 
liberalism and socialism over the course of the nineteenth century was closely 
related to these new notions of Europe with each camp articulating their 
own vision In the context of the rise of modern nationalist movements pacifist 
ideas of perpetual peace gained importance as a solution to the conflicts that 
the nationalist struggles generated
