Introduction
The last century and a quarter have seen sweeping changes in how people 
organise their household and family life From the emergence of private day 
care facilities to the establishment of general pension schemes from rising 
divorce rates to far higher life expectancies meaning that couples who stay 
together can expect to spend many more years in each others company 
households and families are very different now compared to those of our great
grandparents Many of the services previously provided within a household 
most significantly childcare have been outsourced to organisations outside 
of the household changing the roles of parents and relatives in the raising 
of future generations Significant differences exist in how these changes have 
taken place across Europe
Another major change in households is that couples now live together for 
long periods without marrying or never marry but have children and live 
together without the formal status of marriage Many more households than 
ever before consist of single individuals who live alone for much or all of 
their lifecourse or who create blended households unrelated to formal family 
ties Divorce and remarriage have also meant that many children grow up 
with siblings originally born in other families and to whom they may not 
be biologically related Although such blended families existed in the past 
generally due to the death of one parent they are now far more frequent and 
may mean that children are part of two households The ramifications of these 
changes are farranging for adults too and often gendered in their outcome
