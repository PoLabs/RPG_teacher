Introduction
The long nineteenth century saw a dramatic shift in European social 
landscapes Industrialisation mass migration within Europe and overseas 
urbanisation and an explosion in population numbers brought new social 
problems and suggested new solutions Alongside these structural changes 
came significant demographic social and cultural developments Family sizes 
gradually decreased leading by the end of the century to anxieties in some 
countries about population decline and large family networks became more 
scattered as individuals left home in search of new opportunity Meanwhile 
workers began to turn to each other for support more and more organising 
in trade unions and other associations to demand more rights at work and 
in retirement Social commentators also called for new action to address the 
woes they associated with modernity urban squalor injured workers broken 
families and indigent poor Some turned to philanthropic organisations and 
the Church as a bastion of charity and humanity while others urged a greater 
role for the state as a protector of individuals individuals who increasingly 
saw themselves as citizens worthy of social rights And yet others turned 
instead to each other seeking out new utopian living arrangements in small 
collectives Regardless of where people looked for answers to social questions 
manyincluding individuals organisations and governmentsagreed that 
something needed to be done to address them that is to engineer society in 
one way or another
These developments were of course uneven over time and space across 
Europe Industrialisation and urbanisation took place at different times and 
in different ways throughout the continent meaning that the kinds of social 
problems experienced by different regions cities and countries were varied
