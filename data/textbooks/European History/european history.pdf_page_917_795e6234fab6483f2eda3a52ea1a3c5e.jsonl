Introduction
Pleasure and amusement as well as idleness and boredom are integral 
experiences and features of human life Recreation and fun as experiences are 
not limited to a leisure class or the wealthy It would be too much to describe 
leisure as exclusively a modern European bourgeois or nineteenthcentury 
invention But one can argue that in the framework of modernity leisure 
acquired a specific if heavily contested meaning which increasingly shaped 
and affected individuals and their societies In fact the nineteenth century saw 
the arrival of what Peter Burke has called the European system of leisure 
andby 1948the right to rest and leisure was codified under Article 24 in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
But how did this system of leisure come into place What are the core 
characteristics of leisure time How do people experience and make sense of 
this time As this chapter argues manifold processes came together in the 
emergence of the leisure system The first part gives an overview of how leisure 
emerged during the nineteenth century In the following section the urban 
leisurescape of nineteenthcentury Paris the relationship between sports 
and internationalism and the professionalisation and commodification of 
sports all highlight cultural political and economic aspects of practising and 
experiencing leisure time 
Towards a European Leisure System Modern Times and 
the Emergence of Leisure

the commodification of work and personal freedom were overarching forces
