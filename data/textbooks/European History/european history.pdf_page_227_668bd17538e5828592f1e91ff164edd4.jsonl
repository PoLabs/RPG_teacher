influenced by the idea that it is your children who care for you once you are 
no longer able to do so Households in northwestern Europe were frequently 
extended by livein servants or lodgers who provided commercialised care or 
the money with which to buy care 
Households of course exist not only as a set of relationships but also as 
tangible material spaces Historians like Raffaella Sarti have demonstrated 
the significance of objects in the context of early modern households Young 
couples needed to procure the material conditions of living together with 
basic necessities including a bed and a fireplace The early modern period also 
witnessed a growing demand for luxury goods such as the wave of goods 
that became available through colonial trading networks with spices and 
textiles from Asia arriving in the European market This contributed to the 
socalled industrious revolution a shift in which households devoted more 
time to employment and less to leisure in order to afford luxuries Tied in 
with this the puttingout systemsubcontracting manufacturing tasks to 
remote workersmeant that manufacturers across Western Europe in the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries could tap into a large labour supply 
available in rural households The ability to produce goods for manufacturers 
at home while combining this with agrarian work meant that rural households 
could increase monetary incomes As a result early modern urban households 
became further embedded in a monetary system and the market both in terms 
of production and consumption
Conclusion
This chapter has shown that household and family arrangements across 
Europe differed greatly across the continent including distinct eastwest 
variants associated with marriage patterns These differences are debated but 
also had a significant impact on how societies operated It is often argued that 
those from regions where networks were based on extended family ties put 
trust in the extended family over marketbased relationships whereas in a 
nuclear family setting individuals perhaps engaged more actively with the 
marketplace and put more trust in anonymous transactions thereby fostering 
the rise of individualism and capitalism Households and families are therefore 
key to our understanding of many other important historical processes They 
also help to explain the emergence or persistence of disparities across the 
continent Smaller nuclear households in northwest Europe provided less of 
a safety net to fall back on when times were hard These weaker family ties 
can also be linked to the development of forms of collective action ie where 
people work together to improve their lot and to achieve a common goal
