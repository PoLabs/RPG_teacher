immigration such as that of the French Huguenots who towards the end of the 
seventeenth century were invited and encouraged by some rulers to settle in 
their territories in large numbers In the second half of the eighteenth century 
populationist ideas and policies came to be refined with various incentives 
state welfare programmes and efforts to improve hygiene conditions and health 
care It is possible that these efforts began to usher in the massive population 
growth of the nineteenth century Ironically however at the same time a 
negative view of population growth set in soon to be labelled Malthusian 
after the English political economist Thomas Malthus 17661834 who gave it 
its clearest expression Malthus claimed that population growth was limited 
by agricultural economic and infrastructural resources it would be harmful 
above a certain threshold and therefore had to be carefully monitored and 
contained
Additionally in the second half of the eighteenth century a new technique 
began to be employed more and more systematically to measure und number 
the population and the factors of its growth as well as to specify its relations 
with the economynamely the instrument known today as statistics the 
term took on this sense at the very end of the century The deployment of 
statistical calculations and projections was arguably the closest early modern 
protagonists came to such a thing as social engineering Once again though 
the endeavour remained largely theoreticalalthough some statisticians did 
propose systematic manipulations of the economy as well as of the population 
based on their numerical projections and planning the first to do this was 
one of the inventors of statistics the seventeenthcentury English political 
economist William Petty 16231687 It can thus at least be argued that the 
statistical instruments that would enable later social engineering had been 
created in the early modern period
Conclusion
While European welfare systems did not evolve in a linear fashion and the 
early modern period in particular saw both continuity and change the time 
between the Reformation and the onset of fullblown industrialisation clearly 
emerges as crucial in this process Religious reform utopian thinking political 
decisions and private initiatives did lead to significant shifts in the perception 
and handling of poverty but economic factors wars environmental conditions 
and epidemics which impacted demography and wealth distribution were 
also contingent upon the dynamics that shaped early modern welfare While 
both ecclesiastical and state efforts at containing the rise in poverty became 
more noticeable and systematic welfare did not become universally available 
Poor relief and access to education improved significantly for some social
