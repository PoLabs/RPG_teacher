These two strands of research also influenced thought about media and 
society throughout the 1940s and into the Cold War era Media theory is 
often described as having taken a turn in the 1960s with the establishment of 
university departments dedicated to its study and the growing prominence 
of Marshall McLuhans interpretation of the media as extensions of mans 
bodily perceptual apparatus Canadian media scholar Marshall McLuhans 
influential phrasethe medium is the messageconceptualised media 
not solely as the neutral transporter of particular content but instead focused 
on the very process of communicating via media as a formative practice in 
itself that creates rather than simply identifies certain individual recipients or 
collective audiences Nevertheless one should not forget that some of these 
more structural aspects had already been discussed by Cooley and others 
Furthermore new approaches from Deleuze Foucault and Kittler among 
others opened up new ways of thinking about media which called for the 
analysis of the nonhierarchical rhizomatic structures of digital communication 
and the overall importance of media as cocreators of the world we live in 
The example of McLuhan howeverwho famously made a cameo 
appearance in Woody Allens film Annie Hall 1977speaks to a phenomenon 
that became more important during the second half of the twentieth century 
Instead of remaining an experts discourse reflection about what it means 
to live in an age of mass media and mass communication became part of a 
broader and much more popular conversation Some of the most prominent 
analyses of the television era by Neil Postman and others broke new ground for 
a widespread and almost omnipresent discourse about media digitalisation 
and the fundamental shift of communication at the beginning of the twenty
first century How digital media changed and continue to change media 
societies is very much a current question although at least the battle of 
optimistic against pessimistic interpretations of mass media might remind us 
of the fact that these debates are wellestablished and have a long history 
Mass Media under Control
Growing awareness of the potential power of mass media led to its strict control 
and its deployment for political goals This can be well illustrated through the 
example of authoritarian regimes of the midtwentieth century Once in power 
in Italy and Germany the fascist governments first objective was to enforce a 
particular ideology and implement the cultural policy necessary to maintain 
it Thus in contrast to the liberal state the fascist regimes aimed to directly 
control both the sphere of culture as well as a group of ideologically engaged 
intellectuals where culture would be tied to the political objectives set by 
the state As such the newspaper and literary industry were to be controlled 
entirely by the government
