Institutions and the Law 
In most of Europe rulers and in some cases their local and regional 
appointees also made laws and administered justice In other words there 
was no clear distinction between executives legislatures and judiciaries 
That said early modern states engaged in the centralisation standardisation 
and professionalisation of administrative practice from the midsixteenth 
century onwards Early forms of central authorities and state departments 
count among them as do regional and local administrative offices each with 
a wide range of military administrative legal and economic responsibilities 
They included both the secular and religious spheres It was at this time for 
example that representatives of the territorially dispersed Russian Orthodox 
Church agreed on a unified church calendar and saints and thus helped to 
accelerate the integration of the early modern state
While royal councils had existed before as advisory boards for European 
rulers from the sixteenth century their work became more systematic 
differentiated and professionalised developing into early forms of ministries 
during the early modern period In many countries the logic behind the 
differentiation and division of labour was both functional and territorial In 
Spain which soon developed one of the most elaborate conciliar systems 
separate councils not only emerged for matters of state finance and war among 
others but also for the government of Castile Aragon Italy Flanders Portugal 
and the Western Indies In England special councils for regions considered 
unruly such as Wales and the North were formed while an array of councils 
and courts divided matters of government and finance among them These 
councils also had judicial functions in both Spain and England while in France 
such functions were reserved for the most important one the Grand Conseil In 
Muscovy Tsar Ivan IV established central authorities in Moscow in the 1550s 
Over the next decades the number of these prikazy would rise from four to 
seventy and they would regularly send instructions to provincial governors 
As in Spain and England some of these central authorities were responsible 
for territoriesfor example the newly acquired lands of Kazanwhile others 
were specialised in fields of governance There were conflicts of jurisdiction 
that followed partly because the process of expansion and differentiation was 
never systematic
The growth of state institutions also involved their gradual spread into the 
provinces Though it remained haphazard and erratic in some parts of Europe 
until the nineteenth century state penetration into the countryside did make 
headway in other parts during the early modern period Provincial heads were 
increasingly supplied not only with troops but also with administrative staff 
and offices Crucially they came to receive regular salaries from the state 
Particularly where the distances between the provinces and the capital were
