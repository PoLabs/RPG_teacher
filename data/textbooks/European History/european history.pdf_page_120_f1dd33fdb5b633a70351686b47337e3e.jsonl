brought home with them their early impressions of the wider world 
Numerous contemporary chronicles maps atlases and travel accounts 
were published throughout this period These sources of new information 
were complemented by drawings engravings diaries and letters In this 
respect the introduction of the printing press was of tremendous importance 
in accelerating the dissemination of knowledge about the world However 
interpreting the knowledge that early modern Europeans produced about 
the othersthe societies they encountered beyond the borders of the world 
previously known to themis a particularly complicated task While all these 
sources contributed to widening Europes understanding of the world they 
do not provide a straightforward reflection of the environment physical 
appearance economic activities social structure and religious practices of the 
peoples described Historical documents are replete with information about 
the ways in which Europeans perceived what they encountered but these 
ethnographical descriptions were in various ways structured and distorted 
according to existing mentalities and cultural frameworks 
Religious beliefs were key to defining the othersusually identified as 
pagans or infidelsbecause these were the terms by which Europeans primarily 
expressed their identity Geographical political and cultural frameworks were 
of secondary importance In describing the other Europeans often resorted 
to gradation to explain the diversity of populations and customs encountered 
Thus specific areas or human groups were considered more or less irreligious 
and more or less barbarian when compared with other parts of the world A 
particularly influential hierarchy of nonChristian others was produced by the 
Spanish missionary Jos de Acosta 15401600 who divided nonEuropean 
barbarians into three types According to Acosta the Chinese were similar to 
ancient Greeks and Romans in that they lived within clear political structures 
and possessed a written culture The Incas in Peru and Aztecs in Mexico 
also had powerful monarchies but lacked a system of writing Finally a large 
third group contained all those who had no law a term that also included 
religion and who lacked political structures and fixed settlements Explicitly 
or implicitly Europeans often produced this kind of gradation to order the 
others and to justify plans for religious evangelisation and the destruction of 
local customs 
Perceptions are not merely accidental They are important because of the 
role they play in helping to create elaborate systems of prejudice with real 
economic political and social consequences The poor living conditions in 
Europe sometimes fostered paradisiac mirror images of extraEuropean lands 
while the notion of discovery enabled the introduction and manipulation 
of hierarchical structures by Europeans for example to concoct claims of 
dominion over faraway lands and peoples
