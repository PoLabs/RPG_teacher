and were amplified during and after the First World War which was marked 
by what contemporaries saw as a lost generation of young men 
Anxieties about the birth rate intersected with a broader movement that 
was gaining traction in social policy circles during the late nineteenth and 
early twentieth century eugenics Following the publication of Charles 
Darwins 1871 The Descent of Man and other works a number of scholars began 
considering whether specific traits could be inherited Driven by this thinking 
some posited that certain individuals should be encouraged to reproduce 
through for example the incentive of family allowances while others should 
be discouraged from reproducing by means of other disincentives such as 
marriage bans on the disabled or on those with sexually transmitted diseases 
like syphilis These concerns stretched across Europe from Britainwhere 
Darwins cousin Francis Galton helped spearhead the Eugenics Society in 
1907to Russia and could be found across the political spectrum 
Social Policies 
The social question became particularly urgent and politically meaningful 
in the course of the nineteenth century The erosion of traditional ties 
industrialisation rapid urbanisation and both old and new forms of social 
and economic inequality pushed the question of how to prevent or channel 
social unrest to the fore The various social groups in Europe responded 
quite differently to this challenge while workers often opted to unionise or 
organise social solidarity within political parties charities andor families or 
extended households selfemployed people and members of the bourgeoisie 
mostly relied on savings or basic insurance schemes provided by professional 
associations such as guilds or other workrelated fraternities or commercial 
life insurance companies These latter options were however only available 
to the betteroff parts of the population in Europe whereas workers and their 
families mostly continued to live under precarious conditions By midcentury 
most collective risks such as invalidity sickness oldage widowhood or 
joblessness were still not covered by any central welfare institutions Existing 
institutions were mostly local and failed to insure members that were moving 
away from their home region Given the rising mobility of the industrial labour 
force more encompassing and overarching solutions needed to be found
The nineteenth century was by and large the century of the nationstate 
in which the ideas and concepts that had framed its invention since the 
seventeenth century resulted in the foundation of dozens of new nation
states in Europe These states did not only assume responsibility as military 
political or economic agents they also aimed at widening their outreach in 
social affairs Dreading social unrest and looking for ways to bind their citizens
