from territories invaded or annexed by Nazi Germany and its allies The largest 
proportion of the refugees were Jewish by religion or by descent but nonJewish 
citizens also had reason to fear persecution on ethnic or political grounds and 
thus fled in large numbers from countries like occupied Poland in 1939 As 
the war continued and the Nazis pursued a policy of extermination towards 
Jews millions of people in Central and Eastern Europe were murdered Jewish 
emigration from the region during and after the war thoroughly changed 
its composition and culture as characteristic groups and urban subcultures 
disappeared and the complex ties between Jews and Gentiles were broken 
Similar movements of mass flight and forced migration unfolded in 
the other direction as well In 1939 following the MolotovRibbentrop Pact 
signed by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union the Soviet Union annexed 
eastern Poland and in 1940 forced the Baltic states to join the USSR The Nazis 
themselves forced Baltic Germans who had inhabited the region since the 
Middle Ages to resettle within the Third Reich As the Soviet front approached 
the ethnic German population of East Prussia today the Kaliningrad exclave 
of Russia was evacuated en masse never to return to their former homeland 
At the end of the Second World War the Allies instituted wartime agreements 
that led to substantial border changes in Central and Eastern Europe which 
were often accompanied by population exchangesmass expulsions that 
forced several million people to relocate To take Poland as an example 
Germans were expelled from the western territories incorporated into post
war Poland while Polish citizens were forced to move out of the areas ceded 
to the Soviet Union Simultaneously a similar number of ethnic Belarussians 
and Ukrainians had to leave Poland and move to the neighbouring Belarussian 
and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republics areas which by then had become 
permanent parts of the Soviet Union 
Almost everywhere in Eastern and Central Europe the guiding principle 
behind expulsions and population exchanges was the drive of postwar 
governments to transform their countries into ethnically homogeneous states 
an idea that was initially supported by all Allied powers as well However 
given the ethnic linguistic and denominational diversity of Central and Eastern 
Europe and the ethnic complexity of many of its subregions homogeneity 
in most cases could only be achievedif at allby coercion For example 
under a socalled population exchange treaty in 1946 ethnic Hungarians 
from Czechoslovakia and ethnic Slovaks from Hungary could swap their 
domiciles however the figures on the two sides did not match approximately 
120000 resettled Hungarians vs some 73000 resettling Slovaks 
Expulsions and forced resettlement designed partly to solve the nationality 
problem and partly to administer collective punishment disrupted age
old patterns of coexistence By placing people into rigid ethnic or national
