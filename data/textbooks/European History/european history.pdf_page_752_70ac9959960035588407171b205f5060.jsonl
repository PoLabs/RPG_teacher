a harmony between needs and resources that bears witness to the invisible 
hand of providence the alchemy of particular interests produces the general 
interest In this sense The French writer Montesquieu 16891755 is influenced 
by Smith when he states each individual advances the public good while he 
only thinks of promoting his own interest
However Montesquieu is best known for his political theories His 
liberalism was developed when he discovered the functioning of the Lower 
House of Parliament in London 
England is now the freest country in the world I do not exclude any Republic I call it free 
because the Prince has no power to do any conceivable wrong to anyone for the reason 
that his power is checked and limited by an act But if the Lower House were to become the 
master its power would be unlimited and dangerous because it would also have executive 
power Montesquieu Notes sur lAngleterre uvres compltes 1818
A scheme of thought of universal scope inspired by Lockean constitutionalism 
then takes shape the balance of powers guarantees the law that guarantees 
freedom Montesquieus method of analysis involves taking into account the 
diversity of regimes relativism the spirit of the laws consists in the various 
relationships they may have with different things the terrain the climate morals

laws allow From this point of view democracy and aristocracy are not free states 
by nature Political liberty is found only in moderate governments In the same

relativism and his vow of moderation but unlike Locke or Montesquieu he 
thought that abstract liberty was a fiction feared the dictatorship of parliament 
more than the abuse of royal prerogative and conceived of the general interest 
as a set of particular interests limited to each other
A reader of Locke and Montesquieu the French philosopher Voltaire 1694
1778 was much less involved in political theory His admiration for English 
thought can be seen in his Letters Concerning the English Nation 1734 and his 
Dictionnaire philosophique 1764 but in practice he defended the enlightened 
despotism of Frederick II of Prussia to extend his protections in order to 
escape the wrath of censorship and prison Denis Diderot 17131784 for 
his part placed himself under the protection of Catherine II of Russia A 
writer of works such as Rameaus Nephew and Jacques the Fatalist both 
published posthumously in 1805 and 1785 respectively and philosopher 
indefatigable and curious about everything Diderot believed in movement 
and was opposed to any idea of innatism fixism or fatalism His materialistic 
positions earned him serious setbacks His Letter on the Blind 1749 convinced
