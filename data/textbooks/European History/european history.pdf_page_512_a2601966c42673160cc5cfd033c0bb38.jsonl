who opted for a Third Way where there would be still room for policies 
enabling egalitarianism education and healthcare while programmes geared 
towards redistributing wealth were rejected and phased out 
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union many socialist countries were 
forced to embrace capitalism almost overnight In effect this meant that entire 
economic systems based on Marxist principlesand citizens who had lived 
in those systemshad to suddenly operate according to new neoliberal 
principles The rapid and unprepared privatisation of industry and the service 
sector had considerable impact on the welfare systems in place Furthermore 
parts of these systems were subsequently also privatised triggering an almost 
total collapse of the welfare system In both east and west the memories of 
the welfare state are diverse and often conflicting Today the welfare systems 
of the postwar period are either remembered with nostalgia where there is a 
longing for state intervention and benefits or on the other side of the spectrum 
more critical perspectives instantiate the welfare state as a critical flaw that is a 
root problem for the economic competitiveness of many social democratic and 
socialist countries
Conclusion
The twentieth century experienced substantial demographic geographic 
and economic changes These included the quadrupling of Europes urban 
population a steady improvement in working conditions across the board
even if war economic crisis and globalisation dramatically affected the nature 
of work at different junctures throughout this period Not least this era saw 
tremendous changes in terms of family life including reproduction with 
dropping fertility rates in Europe at the dawn of the century and an increased 
focus on the family as a source of stability in the interwar and immediate post
war eras 
These developments alongside growing grassroots political activism 
increasingly powerful states and potent new political ideologies contributed 
to new movements to engineer society in various ways For somelike the 
British economist and politician William Beveridge 18791963the welfare 
state with its comprehensive coverage from cradle to grave could offer 
security in times of crisis and over the usual life course This view was not 
unique to liberal democracies like Britain nor to Western Europe vast social 
experiments and efforts to provide some form of social security extended 
across Europe and beyond the Iron Curtain during the Cold War From the 
late 1970s howeverand increasingly after the end of the Cold Wara move 
towards curbing the state and moving towards publicprivate partnerships 
in providing for social goods became more prominent throughout Europe
