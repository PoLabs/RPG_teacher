Russia Shifting Peripheries Representation and 
Cultural Diversity
The rapidly expanding Grand Principality of Moscow formally adopted 
the title of the Tsardom of Russia Russkoe tsarstvo in 1547 before declaring 
itself an empire imperiia in 1721 There centreperiphery relations were 
also contested and negotiated but in comparison to France they were less 
subject to formal contracts let alone constitutions Notably in various Russian 
principalities during the Middle Ages local populations had enjoyed greater 
autonomy and more influential bodies of representation than they would for 
most of the early modern era In the medieval republics of Novgorod 1136
1478 and Pskov 13481510 and in many parts of the neighbouring union 
of PolandLithuania prior to 1500 the ruling princes were appointed by 
and answered to popular assemblies known as vecha singular veche which 
included nobles as well as poor townsfolk These forums would not hesitate to 
reject the decisions of their princes or even chase them out of office By the late 
fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries however Moscow had absorbed most 
rival principalities Given Russias developing identity as a great power Ivan 
IV the Terrible 15301584 who reigned as the first Tsar from 15471584 
pushed for ever more centralised rule First governors aided by troops and 
administrative staff were established throughout the expanding Muscovite 
state They would receive state salaries while enjoying considerable local 
discretion By 1625 the realm counted 146 such governors Second dozens 
of central administrative organs known as prikazy emerged in Moscow with 
some of them devoted to specific functions such as foreign affairs and others 
to territories such as the Kazan and Siberian prikazy These protoministries 
would maintain growing numbers of staff in both the capital and the regions 
especially for the purposes of taxation paying salaries and for meting out 
justice
Centralisation however remained patchy and contested The early modern 
periphery was an open diverse and transient space As the tsardoms border 
was extended further and further to the east and south it was secured by ever 
more fortification lines and mainly local military servitors Still beyond 
garrison towns central rule remained elusive During rebellions by the fiercely 
autonomous Cossacks 16671671 and 17731775 who otherwise offered 
military service to the tsars central troops fought for years to reestablish 
control Even after such revolts on the Russian side of the border most issues 
concerning justice finances military service and land use had to be negotiated
