An example of the conflict between amateurism and professionalism within 
a country is the FA Cup football tournament The leading competition in 
Britain the FA Cup tournament started in 1871 with amateur rules When the 
northern clubs with predominantly workingclass memberships entered the 
competition soon after the FA tried to defend the amateur status of the game 
against incipient signs of professionalism such as the regular payments that 
some workingclass teams started to offer to some of their players so that those 
could focus on playing football This happened clandestinely of course as 
professionalism was not allowed for instance by formally providing them with 
supplementary jobs In 1883 Blackburn Olympic became the first professional 
club and the first from a workingclass background to win the tournament 
and in 1885 the FA legalised professionalism 
At the end of the nineteenth century sport was becoming increasingly 
professionalised and internationalised There were attempts to institutionalise 
the rules of various sports on an international scale to ensure that international 
competitions were staged fairly For that reason in the 1900s and 1910s most 
major sports created international bodies from cycling UCI 1900 and football 
FIFA 1904 to swimming FINA 1908 and athletics IAAF 1912 However 
these organisations often struggled to assert authority over countries where 
sports were not dominated by amateurism Amateurism gradually began to 
decline from the late nineteenth century onwards although it still survived 
for a considerable time in certain sports For example while the first modern 
Olympic Games had taken place in Athens as early as 1896 without female 
participants professionals were excluded from the games until the Seoul 
Olympics in 1988 Amateurism was also the essence of Rugby Union until 
1995 with rugby remaining the last significant international sport to sanction 
professionalism
The development of professionalism at the end of the nineteenth 
century taking advantage of the modern market society initiated a quick 
commodification and commercialisation of sports as well as its leisure side 
However amateurism also stood fast against commodification defenders of 
amateurism felt that if sports were commercialised victory would become 
more important than participation and sports would not remain a friendly 
activity Cycling is a perfect illustration of this commodification process There 
was a growing international market for bicycles of all kinds a crossborder 
flow of technological advances and bicycle manufacturers and a growing 
interest from the sporting press in cycling Newspapers had a principal role 
in all of these shifts because they advertised technological advances as well 
as new models of bicycle and competitions in other countries Additionally 
another form of leisure was reading sports newspapers as fans sought to 
be informed about results of road races because these competitions which
