23 HOUSEHOLD AND FAMILY
213
Catholic Bavaria In Austria and in the Ottoman Empire the laws on divorce 
and separation were determined by ones religion In any case even where 
divorce laws existed as in Britain after a key reform in 1857 the Matrimonial 
Causes Act it remained expensive and legally difficult to end a marriage 
meaning that marriages that did break down often did so under the radar
Although marriage and divorce as well as other aspects of family law came 
increasingly within the remit of the state over the course of the nineteenth 
century the impact of the law within the household was limited Ideas about 
the rule of the husband and father and of parents more generally meant that 
the law often turned a blind eye to abuse whether physical emotional or 
financial For example the English social reformer Caroline Nortons husband 
took custody of her three children and barred her from seeing them after she 
left him in 1836 It was his legal right to retain custody though she campaigned 
and eventually succeeded in the enactment of the Infant Custody Bill in 1839 
which allowed mothers to keep their children Divorces like Nortons moreover 
reveal the double standard applied to husbands and wives whereas the laws 
of many European countries allowed husbands to divorce on grounds of 
adultery alone women were usually required to prove not only adultery but 
some other forms of abuse as well such as living bigamously or committing 
incest
