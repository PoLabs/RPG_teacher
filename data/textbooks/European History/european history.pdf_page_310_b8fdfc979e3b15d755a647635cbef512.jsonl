in their transformation from socialist dictatorship and central economic 
planning In the process these countries also became part of the European 
integration project This Europewide experiment in regional integration has 
changed the nature of the nationstate and of state collaboration creating a type 
of suprastatethe European Unionconsisting of twentyseven separate 
states However this transformation should not be exaggerated nationstates 
have prevailed as basic political units in Europe despite the efforts to limit 
individual state sovereignty in favour of the supranational institutions of the

states tried to find their own paths to socialism and to renew their national 
sovereignty An alternative view to adopting the Soviet modernisation model
