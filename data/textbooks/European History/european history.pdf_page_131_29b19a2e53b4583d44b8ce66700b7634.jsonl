sheer scale of the fair reflected the essence of America This was enhanced by 
the urban setting of Chicagoperceived as the quintessential American city 
while the gateway of New York still retained something of the Old World
with its immense and rapid growth its towering skyscrapers the rush of 
its commerce and its ethnic heterogeneity For many observers it was the 
epitome of American civilisation at large and what is more a city that was 
becoming a global centre in the modern world Josef tolba 18461930 the 
Czech playwright and traveller characterised Chicago in 1887 as the most 
prominent city of feverishly active America a city that represents the New 
World in a most truthful way providing on a small scale the accurate image of 
this whole new part of the world
Rapidly growing cities that were often compared and contrasted to their 
European counterparts were likely to epitomise the new American civilisation 
in the eyes of Europeans But so too did Americas vanishing indigenous peoples 
and receding native wilderness both of which were seenand sometimes 
idealised by authors like the German writer Karl May 18421912as original

American chieftain facing a majestic female figure representing European 
civilisation made it utterly clear that the aggressive expansion of American 
civilisation was but an offspring of European expansion and hegemony For 
all its differences America was often seen as the completion of the worst or 
the best of the European self 
This example reminds us of the necessity of taking a more nuanced and 
differentiated approach in studying perceptions of the other For the 
representatives of stateless nations such as the Czechs during the nineteenth 
century the melodramatic story of European civilisation advancing at the 
expense of less civilised Native Americans might well have resonated with 
debates over stateless ethnic groups or new national communities and whether 
they must inevitably succumb to established state societies At the same time 
the empathetic view of Native Americans was but a part of a broader European 
intellectual tradition in which the perspectives of universal humanism were 
combined with a romanticised view of the noble savage including other 
racialised stereotypes such as redskins
Britain as its former colonial ruler was arguably affected most deeply by the 
rise of the United States With the end of the American Civil War in 1865 and the
