civilising rolewhich had previously been firmly linked to Enlightenment 
ideals of rationality cosmopolitanism and benefit for humankind Following 
Friedrich Nietzsche Sigmund Freud and other critics from the humanities 
the scientific pursuit has been understood as a display of power over others 
and nature This downfall of the sciences from the pinnacle of optimism they 
had reached in the long nineteenth century however should not obscure the 
fact that the sciences have also remained an agent of cooperation pacifism 
and increasing human welfare not least through international organisations 
such as the World Health Organization or Parisbased UNESCO
The Cold War led to an ideological polarisation of the sciences across the 
Iron Curtain that split Europe along a line from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic 
The bestknown and most infamous example of this divergence relates to the 
inheritance of acquired characteristics championed by the Soviet agronomist 
Trofim Lysenko which was at odds with Mendelian genetics but matched 
well with the premises of MarxismLeninism under Stalin Lysenkoism was 
considered as pseudoscience in Western Europe and America Ideological 
fault lines divided researchers and accelerated superpower competition 
such as the development of aeronautics with the launch of the first satellite 
Sputnik by the Soviet Union in 1957 followed by NASAs moon landing 
in 1969 or advancements in automatisation information science and early 
computing grouped under cybernetics the science of steering and control 
Yet the sciences also developed tendencies to overcome division first through 
international organisations such as the Genevabased Conseil Europen pour 
la Recherche Nuclaire European Council for Nuclear Research CERN or 
the European Molecular Biology Laboratory EMBL HeidelbergCambridge 
UK Second researchers began to actively reflect on their involvement in 
the militaryindustrial complex Eisenhower They shifted for example 
from nuclear research to ecology formed civil society associations or became 
politically active on both sides of the Iron Curtain for issues like disarmament 
gender and economic equality or the environment
Needless to say the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union in 1991 introduced another turn for the development of the 
sciences in Europe Largescale institutional changes in Central and Eastern 
European countries along with shortages of public finances led to migrations 
of highly skilled personnel westwards where computing genomics and 
biotechnology became the most prominent fields Since the 1980s these fields 
have focussed on the persona of the scientific entrepreneur and business 
models such as the startup
Conceptually the scientific twentieth century has often been characterised 
by its discontinuous and dramatic changes or scientific revolutions While 
this concept clearly draws on the early modern study of nature associated
