the Ottoman Empire and the continuous conflicts and wars that ensued in the 
Balkans and in Eastern Turkey led to the movement of an endless number of 
peopleArmenians and Kurds Bulgarians and Greeksbetween contested 
territories And between 1880 and 1914 long before the Holocaust around 25

Internal European Mass Migration
While exile deportation and refuge involved specific groups targeted for 
political reasons much larger groups were mobilised for social and economic 
reasons Various groups engaged in seasonal mobility or some form of 
temporary migration aristocratic families moved regularly between their 
landed estates and urban residences artisans and journeymen looked for 
work in other regionsand even in other countriesfor extended periods of 
time often settling down in remote cities girls and older unmarried women 
moved away from their villages and towns to seek employment as domestic

was war tens of thousands of men for example participated in the Napoleonic 
Wars as soldiers between 1800 and 1814 in search of money adventure or

could become the age of migration due to the rising political influence of the 
liberal notion of laissezfaire laissezpasser which resulted in a general 
relaxation of legal constraints on mobility This did not happen everywhere 
at the same time in the United Kingdom the partial repeal in 1795 of the 1662 
Act of Settlement and Removal marked the end of parish serfdom However 
the central and eastern parts of Europe were characterised at that time by

given the fact that serfdom was not abolished in all of Prussia until 1807 or in 
the Habsburg Monarchy until 1848 and was not abandoned in the Russian 
Empire until 1861 In certain areas of the Russian Empire like the Baltic
