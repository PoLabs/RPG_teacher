UNIT 1 IDENTITIES

However relationships between Europeans and their others were not 
static Over time conceptions shifted in accordance with new information and 
diverging interests The changing attitudes of the Spanish writer Bartolome 
de las Casas 14841566 towards the enslavement of indigenous people and 
Africans is a case in point starting out as the owner of several Taino slaves 
on the island of Hispaniola presentday Haiti and Dominican Republic he 
came to oppose the enslavement of indigenous people advocating instead for 
the transportation of African slaves to address labour shortages eventually he 
also rejected the enslavement of Africans as unChristian Where Europeans 
faced politically and militarily stronger others such as in South Asia and the 
Ottoman Empire changing definitions of otherness played an important part in 
creating a mirror image of Europeanness It is no coincidence that historians have 
traced the emergence of a European sense of identitythat is a geographical 
identity as opposed to a religious oneback to the responses of European 
leaders such as Pope Pius II r 14581461 to Ottoman expansion in Asia 
Minor and southeastern Europe Concepts of otherness were often employed 
to create boundaries between groups but there were many other interactions 
and exchangespolitical commercial cultural and sexualthat were just as 
common as relations of enmity and adversity These too played an important 
part in how Europeans continually reconceptualised their others in the early 
modern period

Europeans imagined other parts of the world
2

3	
Do these images still influence our view of the world And if so why
