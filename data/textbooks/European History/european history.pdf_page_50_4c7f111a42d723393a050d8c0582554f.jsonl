a sense the states in the cordon sanitairethe row of small states along the 
western borders of the Soviet Unionwere further away from France and 
Britain than their overseas colonies
Whether as a democratic republic or an authoritarian dictatorship Germany 
was the economic centre of gravity for the states of SouthEast Europe even 
after it became clear that the Nazi New Order was a lethal vortex for them 
The proGerman part of their public understood these Nazi plans as a New 
Europe 
Post1945
In the years immediately after the Second World War all European nationstates 
were working to rebuild their economies peoples livelihoods and institutions 
for social welfare As for the states of the socalled cordon sanitairefor the 
moment a few of them disappeared from the European scene Although the 
immediate reason for their disappearance was German aggression after the 
Second World War these states could not ignore the fact that the alliances that 
had been offered to them by Western powers had not been serious propositions 
This is important in order to understand the moreorless publicly expressed 
postwar scepticism of the idea of a unified Europe within these states 
During the Cold War Europe as an idea was primarily associated with the 
defence of democracy and liberty from the powers behind the Iron Curtain 
The United States took the lead in reorganising Europefor example through 
the conditions of mutual cooperation that were attached to American aid funds 
for the European Recovery Program commonly referred to as the Marshall 
Plan In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War the Soviet Union 
also had plans to extend its influence further into Europe hoping that an 
impoverished Germany could be drawn into its sphere of influence With 
the 1948 currency reform in the three western occupation zones of Germany 
which stabilised their economy these Soviet hopes were dashed However 
the Soviet Union tightened its grip on the satellite states in EastCentral 
Europe imposing communist regimes on them With this region behind the 
Iron Curtain out of reach Europe was limited to the West and the East was 
considered lost This was felt very keenly by the Hungarians who received 
only humanitarian but not political or military help from NATO during the 
Hungarian Revolution of 1956
In the West although the issue of European identity was not yet at the 
forefront the European idea blossomed once again in the post1945 period
just as it had after the First World War inspired by visions of a peaceful 
and prosperous continent Various movements on the national as well as 
the international level advocated for the establishment of a united Europe
