newspaper would later inform the French people about the aborted attempt 
at a similar democratic revolution in the Dutch Republic in the 1780s before it 
would provide a daytoday account of the French Revolution to its international 
reader base Where news of the revolutionary attempts in other countries 
offered examples and inspiration it also heralded the advent of the political 
magazine which catalysed revolutionary efforts in this period Beginning in 
the 1780s the number of political periodicals in the Netherlands and France
to take two examplesincreased rapidly overshadowing other genres except 
cheap religious prints They offered a platform for revolutionaries to explore 
political ideas and they facilitated cohesion across geographical distances 
allowing dispersed revolutionary groups to coordinate their movement and 
to reflect on the events in similar revolutionary situations abroad Because 
of their regularity they offered an accessible platform for communication 
compared to oneshot pamphlets A letter to the editor sufficed to take part 
in the political debate of the time Letters columns in both newspapers and 
magazines became outlets for political views from all strata of society barring 
only the very lowest classes and thus facilitated the political participation of 
large sections of society for the first time in history
News has been Janusfaced from its conception Its roots lie with sensational 
broadsheets on the one hand and trade correspondence on the other One 
catered for a wide audience seeking something interesting to talk about over 
a drink the other provided dry factual news for the purpose of international 
trade Out of these two Manichean sources the printed news of the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries developed into two forms on the one hand cheap 
broadsheetlike street papers wherein facts and fiction were often difficult 
to distinguish and on the other hand socalled highquality newspapers 
which collected facts from dependable international correspondents And a 
huge variety of hybrid forms in between News was transnational from its 
conception dealing with disaster and death in faraway places or with shipping 
arrivals royal marriages and political revolts abroad Print thus allowed the 
masses to take part in this news and to become part of a wider international 
environment This is exemplified most clearly during the highly politicised 
last quarter of the eighteenth century where political news debate opinion 
and scandal reached larger sections of the population than ever before 
Conclusion 
Print literature is among the best source material we have for studying 
popular culture in early modern Europe and it is the only phenomenon 
that can lay claimduring this time periodto constituting a mass media 
Movable type facilitated the connection between different strata of society
