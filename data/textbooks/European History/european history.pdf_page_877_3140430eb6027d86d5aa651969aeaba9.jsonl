Festivities and rituals have also continued to attract historical attention 
although our understanding of them has become more refined The practice 
of charivari for example was a form of ritualised community censurea 
rowdy mocking demonstration which sought to shame an individual who 
had transgressed community norms especially those concerning marital 
relations an adulterer for example These processions were once conceived 
as a characteristic element of European popular culture but more recently 
historians have drawn out their similarities with other shame punishments 
such as the pillory enforced by formal legal institutions
The picture of early modern popular culture today is rich in complexity so 
much so that it challenges both Burkes original definitions and his chronology 
of change It is clear that peoples cultural experiences varied according to 
gender social status education upbringing race religious belief and place
whether regional urban or rural There is not one homogenous European 
popular culture that we can study Moreover historians are now cautious 
about drawing sharp distinctions between the cultures of the elite and those 
below them on the social scale well into the eighteenth century there were 
significant crossovers of interests attitudes and mentalities between those 
at both ends of the social spectrum Jestbooks provide a useful example

rude quips and scatological humour Historians once categorised these as 
popular texts belonging to the vulgar masses but new research has shown 
that readers were just as likely to be drawn from among the better sort In 
light of these challenges some historians have questioned whether the notion 
of popular culture is still useful and whether we can study it in isolation 
Whether historians cling to the term popular culture or not research into the 
cultural lives of Europeans in the early modern period continues apace and its 
plurality complexity and dynamism is still being unearthed
One kind of source material that continues to be fundamental to the study 
of popular culture in this period is the printed word The first printing press
invented by Johannes Gutenbergwhirred into action in the midfifteenth 
century in Germany Thereafter print expanded in fits and starts across 
Europe and by 1800 it was a routine part of life which penetrated throughout 
societyarguably the only form of mass media in early modern Europe
