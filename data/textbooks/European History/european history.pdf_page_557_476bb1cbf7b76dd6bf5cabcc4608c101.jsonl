44 UNDERSTANDING AND CONTROLLING THE ENVIRONMENT

of knowledge The acquisition of knowledge and changing attitudes towards 
nature developed in tandem despite persistent providentialism the belief that 
man could and should control the natural world gradually gained ground 
Greater control of the environment raised production improved living 
standards and offered protection from risks but it also had negative effects 
Intensive exploitation of natural resources could destroy landscapes and 
ecosystems inadvertently creating new risks and disrupting communities In 
a world increasingly shaped by international trade these effects were felt over 
long distances It is perhaps not a coincidence that some of the first concerted 
efforts to preserve nature were made in Europes overseas colonies
Discussion questions
1	
Was the intensification of the extraction of natural resources in early 
modern Europe a consequence or rather a cause of an expanding long
distance trade
2	
How and why did the concept of nature change in early modern 
Europe
3	
Most people are very much aware of the fragility of our ecosystems 
today Do you see any roots of this awareness in the early modern era
