Introduction
How societies think about and organise the distribution of wealth has a 
profound impact on various domains It affects how people can provide their 
livelihood feed themselves and their children take care of the elderly and 
defines the extent to which they can consume beyond barebone subsistence 
It also affects how much time they can or must spend on various types of 
work and on leisure In this chapter we provide a succinct but broad overview 
of the role of wealth distribution in early modern European societies In this 
overview we pay attention to the interplay between ideas practices and legal 
regimes in the social and economic sphere and the role of political action and 
contestation
Ideas on Wealth and Its Distribution
A shorthand term to describe the predominant economic policy between 
1500 and 1750ie before the advent of capitalism industrial work and the 
development of global marketsis mercantilism Austrian political economist 
Joseph Schumpeter 18831950 indicated that the three shared features of early 
modern mercantilist thought were export monopolism exchange control and 
balance of trade These three principles contributed to restrain the creation 
and distribution of wealth and they favoured the maintenance of a social 
structure headed by landed aristocracy and ecclesiastical privilege Before 1750 
basic ideas on affluency commerce benefits and morally acceptable forms 
of creating wealth in Europe were considerably different from our present 
notions Consequently views on the distribution and redistribution of wealth 
also varied considerably
