consequences of war at various epochs in the past One such epoch that 
witnessed a crucial transformation in warfare was early modern Europe 
Scholars write of an early modern military revolution which links the rise of 
the Modern State to changing practices of warfare The creation of standing 
armies their increasing size and the concomitant growth in expenditure and 
bureaucracy to manage ever more complex strategic and logistical questions 
all necessitated the consolidation of the modern state apparatus This is just one 
of the most significant aspects of the history of conflict and peace in the early 
modern period In this chapter we consider some of the key wars and peace 
settlements of the early modern period analyse changes in the technology 
and practices of warfare present a framework for understanding the shifting 
political allegiances and the balance of power across the period and conclude 
with reflections on the immense political changes wrought by the practice of 
warfare

technology During those centuries this slow evolution would bring together 
traditional models of human behaviour persistence of the tripartite structure 
of society based in milites oratores and laboratores or jurisdictional horizons 
still based on universalisms Papacy Holy Roman Empire the Portuguese 
concept around the Fifth Empire with new geographicalterritorial realities 
in the overseas world or in the forms of government progressively renewed 
and institutionalised Due to the current historiographical doubts about the 
existence of a Modern State especially for the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries this renewed consideration for the period can also be checked thanks 
to the evolution of the Art of War

republics of Medieval heritagewitnessed a string of conflicts during the first 
half of the sixteenth century First there were the socalled Italian Wars a 
struggle for political and military hegemony between Valois France and 
Trastamara Spain under Isabella and Ferdinand the Catholic monarchs that 
continued during the reign of Emperor Charles V of Habsburg Second there
