and Max Horkheimer had brought forward a few years earlier in response 
to genocide and war These sophisticated arguments challenged the image of 
technology as a blessing or as a neutral tool to be employed either for good or 
evil Meanwhile many contemporaries started to observe the visibly harmful 
effects of technological progress with growing uneasiness Cataclysmic events 
such as the 1963 collapse of the Vajont Dam in Northern Italy leading to 2000 
casualties or the dramatic and pollutioninduced forest dieback in Germany 
during the 1970s and 1980s Waldsterben continued to fuel popular criticism 
of technology This pinnacled in response to the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 
the accident at the Soviet nuclear power plant quickly became a symbol of 
the destructive potential of technology In the following years not only did 
Europeans largely reject further construction of nuclear power plants they 
also abandoned various other large technological projects for example the 
construction of multipurpose dams referring to their problematic impact on 
the environment and on humanity Once apostles of technooptimism and 
technological progress Europeans turned technocautious 
Technology Science and the Global Market 
The commercialisation of technology worldwide is no new phenomenon In 
the early modern era for instance pistols and watches had travelled thousands 
of kilometres and crossed the ocean to reach their buyers In the twentieth 
century imports and exports of technology grew unprecedentedly This 
worldwide trade heavily dominated by products made in Europe and North 
America was at the same time accompanied by a growing consciousness among 
governing elites that relying on imports could have serious repercussions on 
their countries sovereignty Therefore nationalist leaders all over the world 
promoted policies of industrialisation creating or boosting local industries 
that were both stateowned and privately owned In general the aim was not 
for complete selfsufficiency but rather to reduce the political and economic 
dangers of dependence on particular providers Moreover this was also part 
of an effort to join the group of the socalled developed countries a category 
linked to infrastructural development and industrial production among other 
criteria For countries emerging from the process of decolonialisation but 
also for independent countries whose economy had long been dominated 
by European companies and investors the control of natural resources was 
a key political issue nationalising existing infrastructures refineries mines 
and constructing dams and powerplants were measures implemented by all 
sorts of regimes left and right authoritarian and democratic During the Cold 
War the countries of the socalled Third World skilfully exploited the rivalries 
between and within the two blocks in order to secure advantageous conditions
