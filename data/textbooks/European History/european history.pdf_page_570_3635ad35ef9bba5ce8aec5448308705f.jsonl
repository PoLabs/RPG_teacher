The Environmental Consequences of Agriculture and Food 
Consumption
Before the Second World War industrialisation mining and urbanisation had 
already visibly depleted particular natural resources and destroyed parts of 
the natural landscape After 1945 the threatening impact of Fordist capitalism 
on the environment was apparent as mass production and mass consumption 
necessitated extractive processes throughout the world As these extractive 
practices accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s to supply an everexpanding 
commodities market so too did the accumulation of waste
In the nineteenth century and especially in the first four decades of the 
twentieth century public and private research centres transformed longstanding 
practices of plant and animal selection and hybridisation which meant 
combining organisms of different breeds varieties species or genera to obtain 
new plants or animals After the Second World War Marshall Plan subsidies 
led to the introduction of agricultural technological packages seeds fertilisers 
pesticides and machinery with precise instructions for their combined use 
the calendar and features of tasks developed by American agribusiness in the 
1930s and 1940s Throughout noncommunist Europe agricultural agencies 
and multinational firms diffused highyield crop varieties which enabled a 
rapid rise in the production of certain outputs thanks to the use of more non
agricultural inputs including fertilisers pesticides and antibiotics to fight 
animal diseases Agriscientists from the Soviet Union and elsewhere in the 
Communist Bloc constructed similar packages with similar contents which 
were adopted in socialist countries 
This new biotechnological model thus spread in Europe and was eventually 
exported to Asia and Africa under the label of the green revolution in the 
1960s It had a large impact in agroenvironmental terms local varieties well
adapted to local conditions were replacedand often disappeared entirely 
Beyond agriculture biodiversity in general suffered as well Living organisms 
of all types were destroyed by pesticides and the increased use of fertilisers 
polluted underground and surface waters Although access to more plentiful 
foodstuffs clearly improved health standards in Europe new chemical inputs 
brought about immediate harm and most likely midterm increases in allergies 
and degenerative diseases
The postwar period also saw other significant changes in agricultural 
equipment From the nineteenth century onwards new industrial machines 
and tools were introduced in the European countryside However most 
of these machines were propelled by human force and especially by draft 
animals which placed a limit on mechanisation since more animals necessarily 
required more land dedicated to feeding them After the Second World War
