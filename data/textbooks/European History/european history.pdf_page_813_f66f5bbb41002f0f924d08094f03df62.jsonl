64 GENERATIONS AND LIFECYCLES

vice versa Thus the idea of a fixed life cycle functioned as a disciplinary 
instrument it assigned people ineluctable qualities and demanded that they 
show the behaviour and talents appropriate to their age 
Many literary texts and images circulating in the early modern period 
reflected these ideas of natural age differentiation and helped to popularise 
these theories The Dutch author Jacob Cats 15771660 whose literary works 
reached a huge amount of literate people in the Dutch Republic organised his 
book of emblems Zinne en minnebeelden Sense and Love Images 1627 according 
to the ages of different reader groups he suggested that young readers should 
pursue each other romantically according to their natural temperaments 
while offering older readers more reflexive and serious texts with recurrent 
themes such as religion and death In another of his books Houwelick Marriage 
1625 Cats represented womens life as a development in seven stages each 
having their specific qualities and tasks Moreover Cats contributed to the 
popular Schat der gesondtheyt Treasure of Health 1636 a medical handbook

people were urged to adapt their behaviour and diet to their age Old people

As the earlier example of Comenius Orbis Sensualim Pictus illustrates the idea 
of age differentiation was also explicitly transmitted to children Following the 
widespread traditional image of life as a staircase Comenius invited young 
people to approach their future life as a succession of distinct identifiable 
stages Through the image of the stairs these pupils learnt to understand their 
own life as a process of ascending and descending of progression and decline 
This process involved a hierarchy between people at different life stages 
adults were at the top children were at the bottom The naturalised division 
between ages was thus at the same time a social system of power relations 
The Discovery of Children
Given the fact that children were situated as lower people at the bottom of 
the social hierarchy it is worth considering the extent to which they were 
considered fully as people How were they valued in society Several
