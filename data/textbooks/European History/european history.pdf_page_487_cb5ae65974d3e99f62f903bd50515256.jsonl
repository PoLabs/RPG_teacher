tried to enforce tax demands and other more immediate obligations but 
the extent to which such demands succeeded depended on the cooperation 
of local elites such as urban oligarchies or village elders Government in the 
early modern period to use the expression of Charles Tilly was not direct but 
indirectie mediated by regional local professional and other elites rather 
than being exerted directly on the population as a whole As a consequence 
early modern populations could not be transformed into uniform subjects It 
may be true that royal courts the only places where rulers had a more direct 
impact on behaviours and norms were platforms for a kind of elite education 
as the sociologist Norbert Elias has argued influentially for the court of Louis 
XIV Even here though as recent scholarship has shown the relationship was 
more complicated as the King himself had to heed aristocratic values
Longterm changes of behaviours and mentalities both among elites and 
populations at large did occur to be sure and they were not entirely unrelated 
to different actions and efforts by churches and secular authorities However 
because these efforts diverged in their aims and changed over time rather than 
following some thoughtout master plan those changes cannot be considered 
direct results of social engineering from above At best such change was the 
longterm and often unanticipated consequence of various shortterm policies 
To take an example the rate of homicide in most parts of Europe decreased 
gradually from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century The extent to which 
this very longterm trend was the result of concrete government initiative 
the result of religious or cultural mentalities or the consequence of yet other 
factors economic for example is still much disputed
The difficulty of answering these questions is compounded by 
methodological problems What can we really know about peoples behaviour 
in such a remote era Are sources such as criminal records in any way reliable 
Perhaps a decline in registered violence was a decline in registration rather 
than a decline in actual violence itself Many case studies have in fact shown 
that we can only very rarely be sure about the actual patterns of behaviour 
behind the recorded sources The specific case of homicide rates seems to 
be a more reliable indicator as violent deaths had been registered relatively 
systematically since the late Middle Ages But what is the real significance of 
homicide rates as an indicator We might expect it to be a reliable measure 
of overall violencebut this is not the case given that among other factors 
minor wounds could often lead to death due to a lack of proper treatment 
and medical hygiene as these gradually improved everyday violence may 
have produced fewer cases of apparent homicides in later centuries without 
a decrease in overall violence Similar methodological problems concern the 
longterm development of sexual behaviour A number of different sources 
suggest that for example premarital sex declined between the seventeenth
