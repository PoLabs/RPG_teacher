in the second half of the nineteenth century primarily as members of one of 
the European nations or of linguisticcultural communities such as English 
French Germans Hungarians and so on depending on location and first 
language The legal emancipation of Jews which occurred at different times 
in different countries 1789 in France 1812 in Prussia 1867 in the Austro
Hungarian Monarchy 1917 in Russia theoretically created the possibility of 
full social integration for Jews However the success of the integration process 
depended significantly on the social cultural and political environments 
of individual countries Whereas the social integration of Jews reached 
generally high levels in Western and Northwestern Europe antagonisms 
were much more likely to prevail in eastcentral and Eastern Europe where 
the proportion of Jews was significantly higher than in the western half of the 
continent Not all segments of nonJewish society accepted Jews in their ranks 
and antisemites often called into question their Jewish compatriots national 
loyalties as well as their sincere identification with their homelands Modern 
antisemitism often and increasingly combined with racial theories by the turn

which cannot be analysed here in detail But the persistence of antisemitism 
in modern European societies had grave consequences later on in the interwar 
period when authoritarian or totalitarian regimes emerged across much of 
Europe

twentieth century Jewish citizens were confined by law to the Pale of Settlement 
a large territory in the western part of the Russian Empire where they were 
mandated to reside and which they could leave only on certain conditions 
In other European areas eastcentral Europe included residential restrictions 
affecting Jews had been abolished by the 1850s at the latest They had to endure 
various forms of popular as well as statesponsored antisemitism including 
periodic pogroms which were among the main reasons for largescale Jewish

Conclusion
The ethnic map of Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century was diverse and 
characterised by timehonoured patterns of coexistence With the emergence of 
modern forms of nationalism however multiethnic and multicultural states 
as well as their resident ethnic groups were faced with new challenges Efforts 
to transform countries into modern states often led to assimilationist policies 
and the attempted marginalisation of ethnic minorities In absolutist regimes 
national demands for greater representation erupted in revolutions by mid
century national and ethnic tensions assumed different forms in constitutional
