penetrated and controlled by the centre Still this did not stop the centre from 
meeting resistance with force
France and Russia both pursued policies of colonial expansion with new 
peripheries serving a mixture of geopolitical and economic interests While 
both moved into adjacent territories which in the Russian case extended as 
far as Siberia France also engaged in overseas colonialism These different 
forms of expansion led to an increase and diversification of peripheries and 
peripheral societies At the same time France tended to reproduce its own 
tripartite social structure in newly acquired territories some of which were not 
so different in social terms while early modern Russia had too diverse a society 
with many different religions languages etc and too tenuous a central grip 
to be able or even aspire to impose its social structure on borderlands This 
would change dramatically in the modern period
