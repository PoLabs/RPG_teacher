did not diminish By the end of the long nineteenth century both property 
and income were at least as unequally distributed as they had been at its 
beginningand very often even more so Moreover European economic 
growth was based on the transfer of income from the wider world as a return 
of financial commercial and industrial investments European inequality was 
fed by flows from formal and informal colonies and by asymmetric exchanges 
that by 1914 covered almost all the regions in the world
As our references to revolutions reforms and growth imply the persistence 
of inequality did not mean the reproduction of ancient social hierarchies The 
various legal devices that sustained the property of aristocrats and members of 
the clergy were gradually abolished or reshaped and almost everywhere rich 
merchants bankers industrialists and other affluent proprietors joined the 
ranks of the social elite The social prestige of aristocratic titles and the political 
entitlements connected to them did not disappear Many noble families kept 
their estates and some accumulated new wealth thanks to their urban property

social and political connections However new families benefitting from social 
dynamism and economic changes also took part in enjoying the privileges of 
aristocrats sometimes marrying into old established families 
At the bottom of society new forms of destitution were born from the 
weakening of communitarian resources and links the differentiation of 
peasant groups and the growing deficits of nutrition and sanitation in 
many urban areas throughout Europe There has been a long debate among 
historians on the living standards during industrialisation with no clear 
and general results However we know that during most of the nineteenth 
century some indicators point towards a lower quality of life in urban areas 
the socalled urban penalty Growing public concern over the social question 
was multiplied by a burgeoning literature that portrayed the dangerous 
classes as a fuel of crime sex work and forced or free emigration overseas 
This became a common element all over Europe including countries where 
industrialisation had not taken place We cannot tell what happened with 
much of the rural population even where they had more access to property 
as in many countries it seems that their average consumption increased only 
very slowly and underwent setbacks Villages tended to become more unequal 
microsocieties since the privatisation or nationalisation of common goods as 
well as the commodification of natural resources and human labour widened 
the distance between the elites and the lower groups in rural communities 
Where serfdom had been the generalised condition of peasants emancipation 
offered some of them the possibility to accumulate certain wealth and other 
forms of capital and to distinguish themselves from their peers At the
