At the front national dissent could lead to mutiny and revolution In1917 
there were several waves of desertion including the famous mutiny by about 
40000 French soldiers between April and May of 1917 and by soldiers in 
Germany who allowed themselves to be taken prisoner without fighting who 
voluntarily mutilated themselves and sometimes undertook acts of collective

never resulted in a direct military confrontation in Europe at least was fought 
at the global level using a broad array of political economic and diplomatic 
instruments as well as new forms of rivalry such as proxy wars or psychological 
warfare It largely shaped the history of Europe in the second half of the twentieth 
century and significantly transformed its role in the international system The 
European continent occupied a different position in the newly emerging post
war order which was heavily influenced by the United States and the Soviet
