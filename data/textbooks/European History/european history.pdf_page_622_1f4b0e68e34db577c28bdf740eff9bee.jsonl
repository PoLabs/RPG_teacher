UNIT 5 ECONOMY

England was a relative leader in the extent to which serfdom had been 
unrolled by the sixteenth century though a similar pattern of growing social 
polarisation eroding a broad tradition of corporate revolt can be observed in 
the Low Countries The most extensive rural revolt of the early modern period 
the Peasants War was also mobilised around a programme of attacking 
feudal obligations and asserting common rights extended to encompass 
rights over control of religious life The gospel of social protest inspired by 
the Reformation developed into the sectarian reformation of the Anabaptists 
whose ideals could sometimes translate into attempts to build communities 
free of social or economic divisions holding property in common Following 
the British Civil Wars of the 1640s a similar experiment in communal living 
was attempted by the followers of the Digger Gerrard Winstanley Although 
generally shortlived and readily suppressed radical utopianism of this sort 
with its potential to offer an alternative vision of society and the distribution 
of wealth alongside the defence of customary rights and freedoms would 
eventually contribute to the development of a plebeian culture of resistance in 
the very different circumstances brought about by industrialisation
Conclusion
Throughout this chapter we have presented how rising inequality of wealth 
and of income was a fundamental characteristic of early modern European 
societies This rising inequality was not a force of nature Although natural 
phenomena such as epidemics and weather conditions could affect the 
distribution of wealth in the short term they rarely affected the distribution 
of wealth over the longer term Legal social and political regimes as well as 
policies and institutions were the main forces that determined the distribution 
of wealth and the level of inequality in a society These regimes were influenced 
by ideas from theologians as well as philosophers and other authors who 
published on the role and responsibilities of a ruler and the ruling elite Ideas 
about a just price and about control over trade through mercantilist policies 
dominated through to the eighteenth century after which philosophers began 
to more strongly advocate free trade Apart from changing ideas political 
action in the form of protests and rebellions could also affect the distribution 
of wealth Often these actions invoked a vocabulary of attachment to old 
customs and resisted new policies by emerging state institutions and rising 
economic elites The distribution of wealth in early modern Europe was thus 
a process that was deeply affected by ideas sentiments and aspirations of 
intellectuals political and social elites as well as the lower strata of society
