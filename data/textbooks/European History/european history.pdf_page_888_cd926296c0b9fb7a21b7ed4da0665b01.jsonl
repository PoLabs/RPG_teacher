Print shops that sold these prints and posters sprang up across the continent 
The printing press incorporated images as well often as woodblock print 
In newspapers these wood engravings were first used for the mastheads 
but increasingly served as visual depictions of newsworthy people or events 
From the 1840s onward illustrated newspapers sprang up in countries 
across the continent The Illustrated London News was the first to reach a mass 
audience swiftly followed by other notable titles such as the Illustrirte Zeitung 
published in Leipzig and LIllustration of Paris and later by other illustrated 
newspapers from Portugals A Ilustrao to Russias Vsemirnoy Obozreniye 
These illustrated newspapers did more than simply present news in an 
attractive way They expanded and democratised the audience for news 
and reshaped the way the public related to events Where news had always 
been delivered in oral or printed form news now also became something 
visual changing how audiences across the continent understood the world 
around them and increasing the knowledge that broad segments of European 
populations could engage with or possess 
Visual knowledge was accessible to the illiterate and could include 
representation of the wider world prints and views of monuments and 
landmarks such as the pyramids in Egypt became popular illustrations 
and increased Europeans mental reach far beyond their physical travels 
And because an international market developed for such printsillustrated 
magazines buying each others engravings printmakers exporting their wares 
to print shops abroada continental visual culture started to take shape 
The photograph played the main role in this process The invention 
of the photographic process led to a craze in the 1840s for the first type of 
photographthe socalled daguerreotype invented by the French painter 
Louis Daguerre 17871851 As early as 1840 one year after the presentation 
of photography at the French Academy of Sciences a satirical sketch by the 
caricaturist Thodore Maurisset 18031860 mocked la Daguerreotypemanie 
Daguerreotype mania with throngs of people jostling to see buy and take 
photographs see Figure 1 Photographs in this period were mainly portraits 
but were also still lives or depicted natural wonders and cityscapes Other 
types of photography soon followed the daguerreotype types that were 
cheaper andcruciallycould be reproduced endlessly 
The spread of photography not only added a new medium for 
disseminating information but also implied a mental revolution changing 
peoples conception of what was true real and verifiable It also created a 
demand for family portraits cartes de visite and stereographs which could be 
viewed in 3D to be sold in print shops A market emerged for cartes de visite 
of notable people as well as posters where they were arranged in groups
