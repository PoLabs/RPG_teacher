slavery Although the decision of the judge did not explicitly mention slavery 
in the overseas British colonies it opened the way for broader interpretations 
and effectively launched the antislavery movement Finally the Slavery 
Abolition Act of 1833 put an end to slavery in most parts of the British Empire 
The 1833 Act made the ownership of slaves illegal while former owners of 
slaves were financially compensated
Internationalism
One of the characteristics of the nineteenth century was the internationalisation 
of revolutions and protest movements often around the issue of nationalities or 
democratic representation Perceptible from the beginning of the century and 
more intensely from the 1820s onwards the nationalities movement was based 
on the revolutionary principle of the right of peoples to selfdetermination 
It led to national or liberal attempts at insurrection culminating in the 
revolutions of 1830 Multiple circulationsof people ideas knowhowand 
a transnational mobilisation process were at the heart of these attempts
These movements were mostly driven by a cosmopolitan elite and point 
to the discrepancy between the aspirations of the liberal elites and the other 
groups involved in the revolutionary process the disappointment of the 
Philhellenes with the Greek people or the conflicts that arose from the July 
1830 Revolution for example 
From the 1830s onwards insurrectionary political movements began 
to broaden their popular base often in the clear image of the democratic 
inspiration that we can find at work in Mazzinis Young Italy movement 
The process of extending the political participation of the working classes 
can also be seen in revolts motivated by economic social and political issues 
the Swing Riots in 1830 in England the Rebecca Riots in Wales in 1839 and 
18421843 and the revolt of the canuts in Lyon in 1831 and 1834
The simultaneity of the revolutionary movements during the nineteenth 
century is remarkable and suggests a dense circulation of information in a 
context of growing internationalisation Most of the time these were popular 
uprisings with a strong national idea to which democratic or liberal demands 
were added The revolts of 1848 initially produced forms of power that took 
these expectations into account but they were quickly suppressed
The emergence of the labour movement is another example of the 
growing internationalisation of a movement that flourished throughout the 
industrialised countries The idea of a popular international organisation 
which originated in the circles of political emigration had given rise to various 
endeavours in the wake of the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 This aspiration 
however would not be realised until the founding of the First International
