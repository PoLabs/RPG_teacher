violent popular offensive against the Vonckists who then went into exile in 
France The Brabant Revolution now openly took the form of a conservative 
revolution the Statists reestablished the old regime only without the Austrian 
sovereign However they soon succumbed to the counteroffensive launched 
in November 1790 by Austria and its Prussian and British allies
All of these failed revolutions of the 1780s were inspired by the success 
of the American Revolution they took up its slogans its symbols and its
