Introduction
Over the course of the twentieth century protest and social movements 
changed dramatically In the first half of the century much of the European 
continent was embroiled in conflict between right and leftwing movements 
that sought to take power through revolutionary upheaval By the end of the 
Second World War this central conflict had led to very different outcomes 
which reconfigured the possibilities and aims of protest according to where it 
took place In Southern Europe rightwing dictatorships ruthlessly persecuted 
their leftist opponents for decades but protests around 1968 proved formative 
for the democratic revolutions that would eventually take place once these 
regimes were weakened In the liberal democracies of Western Europe there 
was decidedly more scope for protest than there was under dictatorship and 
in the 1960s young people in particular questioned the limits that authorities 
imposed on both protest and on democracy itself In Eastern Europe uprisings 
against Sovietstyle communist dictatorships were violently repressed but 
they eventually gave way to forms of dissent and ultimately open protests 
that called for democracy Developments across the continent differed greatly 
by region but by the end of the twentieth century there was a general trend 
that culminated in the fragmentation of political movements blurring the 
lines between left and right and simultaneously leading to intenseand 
inconclusivecontestation over what democracy could and should mean
