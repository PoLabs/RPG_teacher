legible ie it rearranged them according to the needs of government Parallel 
to the intervention in the environment authorities developed early forms of 
state bureaucracies which enabled them to gain more oversight and access to 
individuals and the environment 
Changing Attitudes
In the early modern period the theology of nature was the dominant discourse 
regarding the relation between man and environment Nature was considered 
Gods creation and natural disasters were seen as an expression of Gods 
punitive wrath or as his warning to compel people to change their behaviour 
It would be wrong to think that the scientific revolution produced a discourse 
of rationalism that was antagonistic to this providentialism Even though the 
French philosopher Ren Descartes 15961650 wanted to make man master 
and possessor of nature he saw God as the great Horologist the One who 
invented the mechanism of Nature and gave it its initial impetus For Descartes 
living as a good Christian was a condition for avoiding natural disasters and 
successfully farming the land 
Nevertheless attitudes changed from the late seventeenth century 
onwards Increasingly states communities and individuals did not leave 
their survival up to divine intervention but actively worked to prevent 
natural disasters and mitigate their impact For example the development 
of probability calculation about human mortality by the English statistician 
John Graunt 16201674 and the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens 1629
1695 allowed for the development of the insurance system in 1686 Lloyds 
was founded in London and in 1698 the first life insurance contracts were 
established Drawing up and implementing specific regulations was another 
way for the state and cities to protect the people at risk For example after 
the Great Fire of London 1666 new regulations on urban construction were 
adopted all over Europethatched roofs and wooden houses were banned 
minimal distances between houses were established and chimney sweeping 
became compulsory
It was not only the state that acted changing attitudes also came from below 
During the eighteenth century some farmers and peasants tried to improve 
yields and avoid starvation by cultivating their fallow land with new crops 
such as potatoes and leguminous plants which allowed for the regeneration 
of the soil and also by using urban dung as fertiliser thus challenging limits 
to population growth The eighteenth century also witnessed an olfactory 
revolution Urban elites could no longer tolerate strong smells which were 
described as a danger to health Thus washing the body became a social 
expectation Meanwhile the authorities adopted regulations for collecting 
urban waste and moving cemeteries outside the city limits In this context
