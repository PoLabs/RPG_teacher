school teachers who in turn were in the position to influence future elites One 
of many steps for nationalising universities was the creation of an individual 
department for the language in question In Habsburg Central Europe conflicts 
erupted frequently when an originally Germanlanguage university was to be 
nationalised The most infamous case was that of the Charles University of 
Prague where a large German minority strived to prevent the czechisation 
of the oldest German university After violent conflicts erupted between Czech 
and German students a compromise was reached in 1882 according to which 
the university was divided into a German and a Czech part both of which 
could keep the historical name 
Museums were also lined up in service of national integration Their new 
task was to strengthen the community by elaborating the connection between 
its past present and future In Central Europe national museums gained 
special political significance and were eminent institutions of guarding and 
using the national language particularly in Prague and in Pest where the 
oldest national museum was established in 1802
Nevertheless besides the undeniably strong tendency of nationalisation 
the connections crossings and mutual influences between nations are also 
apparent in this period One major expression of the internationalisation 
of sciences and humanities in the nineteenth century was the dynamism of 
international congresses They were often encouraged by the organisation 
of universal exhibitions starting in 1851 and sometimes echoed major 
economic debates on a European scale as evidenced by the Brussels Congress 
on Literary and Artistic Property 1858 From 1878 onwards international 
congresses multiplied and contributed to the international structuring of 
scientific communities concerning both human and natural sciences The 
internationalisation of the research sphere also led in part to a standardisation 
of instruments and methods especially in the social natural and technical 
sciences These instruments and methods were often promoted by 
international institutes such as the International Statistical Institute founded 
in 1885 and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures established in 
1875 Standardised instruments and methods simplified the traceability of 
knowledge and its practical application beyond national borders 
International exchange was also important for emblematic figures of 
nationalist movements who maintained contacts across national borders 
For example one of the founding fathers of the Czech national revival 
Josef Dobrovsk was in close contact with Ferenc Szchnyi founder of the 
Hungarian National Museum where the former conducted important research 
The same is true for academies that regularly honoured famous scholars from 
rival nations The transfer of scientific practices was not necessarily hindered 
by political differences For example the German model of research university
