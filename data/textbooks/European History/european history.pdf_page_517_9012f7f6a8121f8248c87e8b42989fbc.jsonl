Thus runs translated from the Latin a fragment from one of Erasmus 
Colloquies The great humanist reformer established them as a collection of 
simple dialogues geared towards schoolchildren published in 1522 For a 
change readers of the colloquies could relate to their own daily lives instead of 
some Roman conqueror Gradually as the collection of colloquies grew they 
were reprinted time and again and used at grammar schools to teach Latin 
even well into the nineteenth century As was his custom Erasmus not only 
familiarised school students with Latin phrases for daily use but also ridiculed 
many pastors and monks in these elegant Latin conversations Theologians 
teaching at universities across Europe were not amusedand in Rome the 
dialogues were put on the Index of Forbidden Books along with many other 
works by Erasmus

that had been firmly established since the midfourteenth century the time
