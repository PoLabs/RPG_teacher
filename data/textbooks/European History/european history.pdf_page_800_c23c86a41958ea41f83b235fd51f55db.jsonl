with which to analyse the relations between countries in the international 
economy was a product of the Latin American structuralist school Its main 
exponent was CEPAL the UN Economic Commission for Latin America 
among whose personnel the Argentinian Ral Prebisch and the Brazilian 
Celso Furtado stand out In the structuralist theory emphasis is placed on the 
relationship between industrialised countries and raw material exporters and 
the unequal relationships that develop from that basis
Recent Latin American critical theory especially from the representatives 
of decolonial studies develops the idea of dual relations between centre 
and periphery For some decolonial thinkers it is not only the economy that 
creates unequal relationships but also the construction of knowledge Some 
historians denounce the geopolitics of knowledge which tries to explain 
how the peripheralisation of some places and the centrification of others 
has operated This reveals the interaction of certain types of knowledge 
produced by the relationships of subordination and the inferiorisation of the 
knowledge generated in other places those of the periphery and those of the 
colonial difference for the sake of dominating exploiting and subjecting the 
latter This theory seeks to point out that knowledge as such has often been 
produced with universalist pretensions in the centresin schools academies 
universities by literary and scholarly elites In reality this wisdom is partial 
knowledge on the reality of the world written from a particular point of view 
Centres create discourses enunciations and knowledgeincluding History
and in this sense decolonial studies is an attempt to confront and transcend 
Eurocentrism as a model of universal development 
In the perspective of European historiography universal analytical 
concepts have long been established including development progress 
modernisation civilisation and temporality from the European 
chronologies of time medieval modern and so on They are assumed to be 
valid for the entire world Historiography thus went on to homogenise the 
narrative structures of different histories and build uniform methodological 
standards This is precisely one of the problems of modern epistemology the 
construction of Eurocentric metanarratives that played and continue to play 
a decisive role in the construction of a history centred on world unity and the 
evolutionary notion of time progress and development In consequence actors 
located in the continents of Latin America Asia or Africa usually appear as a 
secondary element in historiography because these are the regions considered 
far from the centre of the world They are considered to be underdeveloped 
compared to the NorthWest of Europe in a device that creates a kind of West
andtherest dichotomy Therefore some scholars nowadays recognise that 
thinking about the past is a positional action and that the illusory notion of a 
neutral omniscient narrator must be rejected In this sense historiographical
