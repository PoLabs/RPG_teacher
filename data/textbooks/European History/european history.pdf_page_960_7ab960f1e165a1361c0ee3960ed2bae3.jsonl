The Twentieth Century The Heritage Boom and Birth of 
New Disciplines
The roots of heritage preservation and its first legislation can be traced back to 
the three decades before the First World War Over the course of the twentieth 
century heritage became increasingly institutionalised In the aftermath of the 
destruction of the First World War the League of Nations debated international 
standards in the fields of heritage conservation during times of conflict 
Between the two World Wars member nations of the League of Nations agreed 
on key principles formulated in the 1935 Roerich Pact which advocated the 
creation of a Red Cross for heritage in times of conflict Although the League

its bureaucratisation Although local heritage workshops often grassroots 
organisations of amateurs and heritage enthusiasts continued to be very 
active and to call for the protection of vernacular and industrial heritage the 
proliferation of lists laws and paperwork meant that heritage increasingly
