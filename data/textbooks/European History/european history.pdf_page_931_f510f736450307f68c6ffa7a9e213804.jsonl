Shake Shimmy and Twirl Modern Excitement in the 
Dutch Interbellum Dancehall
In the early twentieth century social dances such as the twostep the turkey 
trot the tango and the Charleston made their way into Western European 
ballrooms restaurants and dancehalls These modern dances as they were 
called had developed in the United States and Latin America in the case 
of the tango To execute them couples stood in a close embrace and were 
encouraged to wildly and loosely move around the dancefloor kicking their 
legs and shaking their torsos Especially during the roaring twenties this new 
style of dancing became immensely popular in Western European cities such 
as London Paris The Hague and Berlin It offered growing groups of young 
urban and increasingly female professionals new and modern ways to use 
and display their bodies engage with members of the opposite sex encounter 
people of other social classes and cope with the changes in modern society 
This new experience excited many but also aroused moral panic For 
example critics in the Netherlands wondered whether these American dances 
were too superficial for intellectual and elegant Europeans And there was 
also the question of whether the assumed sexual nature of the dances morally 
degraded the dancers As a social debate developed in the Netherlands about 
the suitability of American dance culture for Europeans the dancehall became 
a space where different experiences of modernity came together and were 
negotiated
The dances offered many people a way to cope with the urbanised and 
industrialised society of the early twentieth century The quick and wild 
movements required to execute the dances reflected the rushed and fast
changing way of life in the modern industrialised metropolis Simultaneously 
a night in the dancehall could be a way for people to escape from modernity 
It was a way for people to cope with the individualised industrial mass society 
in which they were becoming more estranged from each other and from 
the work they did It offered people an escape from their daily lives and the 
opportunity to keep fit or at least to reconnect with their bodies after sitting 
for long hours at the office Moreover some dancers came to dancehalls to 
overcome the modern feeling of estrangement and argued that dancing could 
trigger instinctive primal emotions that allowed people if only for a moment 
to experience a connection to each other 
However not everyone believed that the dancehall offered a means for coping 
with modernisation Cultural critics and religious organisations doubted that 
such superficial experiences could remedy the loss of interpersonal connection 
in modern life Moreover they were suspicious of modern interactions 
between men and women on the dance floor
