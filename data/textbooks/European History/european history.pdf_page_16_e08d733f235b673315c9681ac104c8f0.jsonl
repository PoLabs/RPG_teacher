depends not only on the topics and historical events it addresses but above all 
on its questions its perspectives and the way it analyses and narrates Despite 
all the differences in detail European history as a perspective approach or 
method is characterised by at least four features first it is driven by an effort 
to narrate historical processes from multiple or comparative perspectives be 
they national or regional global or local macro or micro Second it emphasises 
processes of mutual interaction exchange and transnational contact also 
with nonEuropean or colonial spaces without overlooking local specificities 
Third the European history approach emphasises the contingency of the 
historical process and avoids narratives of progress toward everincreasing 
civility The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine that started in 2022 
is a painful reminder of how fragile peace in the twentyfirst century still is 
Fourth it uses its insights into the past to reflect on the present That does not 
mean that the historian should become a political advisor or even an apologist 
for the process of European unification but that she can offer a reflected 
commentary on the historical roots of the present
This handbook is not only rooted in conceptual reflections about the nature 
of European history It also grew out of very practical considerations about how 
to teach European history in the twentyfirst century universities in Europe 
are internationalising rapidly welcoming students from all over the world 
This raises important questions about how and what to teach this increasingly 
diverse student body What kind of European history is appropriate for 
say an Italian undergraduate student enrolled in a BA History programme 
delivered in English at a Dutch university or for a Syrian national studying 
likewise in English at a Polish university With the continuing process of 
internationalisation in higher education Brexit and immigration restrictions 
all making studying at British universities for students from EU member 
states and nonEU students ever more difficult this experience is becoming 
increasingly common 
Furthermore European history is not only taught in Europe What is the 
right kind of European history for say a student in Singapore taking a module 
on social movements in early modern Europe If European history is whatever 
we want it to be there is a clear mission to create appropriate material with 
which to teach this increasingly internationalised student population
Universities in continental Europe have set up a great number of English
language programmes over the past decades including in history The need for 
more Englishlanguage programmes and modules has long been highlighted 
in national internationalisation strategies For example in 2012 the German 
Action Committee on Education Aktionsrat Bildung emphasised the central 
importance of the internationalisation of teaching at German universities 
particularly of curricula if the attractiveness of German universities for
