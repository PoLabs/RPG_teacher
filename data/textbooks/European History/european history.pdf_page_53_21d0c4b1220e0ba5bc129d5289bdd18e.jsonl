11 IDEAS OF EUROPE
33
Conclusion 
Arguably the idea of Europe was never tested as it was during the twentieth 
century a time when the continent was devastated by unprecedented violence 
and bloodshed driven by ideological divisions and divided between two 
superpowers locked in a seemingly endless standoff At the same time by 
the end of the century the idea of a united peaceful and prosperous Europe 
had become an everyday experience for most people on the continent These 
two extremes characterise the development of ideas of Europe in the twentieth 
century Throughout the crises of the first half of the century when the reality 
of a united Europe seemed further away than ever the idea of Europe was 
proposed as the solution to the continents upheavals as a common goal in 
peace and prosperity 
After 1945 this vision of European unity was limited mostly to Western 
Europe and framed by the ideological struggle between East and West When 
this vision was put into practice under American guidance it lost some of its 
allure through the evidently bureaucratic nature and undemocratic ethos of 
European institutions However when the Cold War ended the reality and 
idea of Europe embodied for many by the supranational institutions of the 
European Union seemed stronger than ever and the natural model for the 
whole continent Since then the lived idea of a united Europe has lost some of 
its sheen weathering internal and external crises and has had to face growing 
criticism by antiEuropean movements
