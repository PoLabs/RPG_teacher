44 UNDERSTANDING AND CONTROLLING THE ENVIRONMENT

tractors and combustion engineswhich had been extremely scarce before the 
warbegan to replace animals through a generalised process of motorisation 
which affected nearly all European farms by the 1970s Hence agriculture that 
had previously been autonomous in terms of energy since it transformed solar 
power into biomass started its transition to an energyconsuming activity 
based upon mineral fuels and inputs
The subordination of agriculture to agroindustrial concerns which sold 
inputs andor bought final products went handinhand with the socalled 
modernisation of agriculture which might be summed up as biotechnology 
plus tractors The internationalisation of productive and commercial chains 
especially after the 1970s fostered new transformations in the types of 
technology created for agrarian production New international flows started 
to deliver food globally food which was produced in places where the balance 
of factors among prices technology and environmental regulations made it 
cheapest or where it enabled goods to be supplied yearround thus reducing 
seasonal limitations on production This was the continuation of a trend 
which can be traced back to the eighteenth century and on a larger scale to 
the age of empire Through its import of foodstuffs Europe began to consume 
more and more natural resources from around the world It increased the 
energy consumed and the waste produced by agricultural production on other 
continents The split between places of consumption and production thus 
contributed to the concentration of environmental degradation and enabled 
Europeans to export their environmental costs This happened not just in 
agribusiness but also in the case of a panEuropean electrical grid as well as
for instancein the production of uranium first mined within Europe and 
later in the context of globalisation overseas For example France closed its 
mines for safety reasons and now imports fuel for its nuclear power stations 
from Africa
Since the twentieth century certain trends as well as some countervailing 
tendencies have become more pronounced The development of genetically 
modified organisms means that the control and centrality of agribusiness 
within the agricultural sector has increased through the production of seeds for 
plants which do not reproduce and which thus make farmers more dependent 
on agribusiness corporations Transgenic agriculture demands more external 
inputs although it can also eliminate some of them favours soil destruction 
and tends to reduce biodiversity At the same time new consumer and socio
political movementssome linked to green parties and associations and some 
linked to health or consumer protectionare demanding a more ecofriendly 
agriculture They are promoting the consumption of local seasonal products 
grown with fewer or no inorganic inputs and pushing for livestock to be 
raised extensively in openair pastures instead of intensively in highdensity 
factory farms that require heavy capital investment
