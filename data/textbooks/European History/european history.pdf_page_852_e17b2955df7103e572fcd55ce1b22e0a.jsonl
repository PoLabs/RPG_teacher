Social Utopias
The social and economic disruptions caused by the development of capitalism 
and industrialisation in nineteenthcentury Europe sparked a wave of utopian 
ideas and experiments that aimed at imagining and practicing a different world 
Most of these utopias were based on ideas of solidarity and egalitarianism 
addressing rising inequality in rapidly industrialising European societies by 
sharing the fruits of labour more equally with the workers and the poor
These radical ideas formulated by thinkers like SaintSimon the British 
social reformer Robert Owen 17711858 and the French philosopher Charles 
Fourier 17721837 inspired the founding of communes and cooperatives 
in Europe and the rest of the world One example is the Guise Familistre 
a utopian community founded in 1859 by French industrialist JeanBaptiste 
Andr Godin 18171888 Godin wanted to create a perfect society ruled 
by freedom equal rights for all citizens fraternity in all human relations 
Following Fouriers ideal of a phalanstery the Familistre housed families 
working at his nearby factory which he turned into a worker production 
cooperative For Godin the Familistre made it possible to create equivalents 
of wealth meaning all the conditions of comfort and health that the 
bourgeoisie afforded itself through money and that the residents of the 
Familistre could now afford through cooperation The building consisted 
of 558 flats and 350 houses with a central courtyard under a glass roof By 
contemporary standards the residents had a very comfortable and luxurious 
life all houses and flats had running water a rubbish chute and two toilets 
There were also collective services like allotments a nursery and a school 
shops a laundry room a theatre and even a swimming pool However putting 
Godins ideas of cooperative work into practice was not without its obstacles 
a series of experiments in shopfloor democracy in which the workers for 
example had to vote on who among them had earned higher pay failed after 
they often chose whoever would return the favour next time The factory was 
eventually turned into a listed company in 1894 with the shares owned by the 
workers
