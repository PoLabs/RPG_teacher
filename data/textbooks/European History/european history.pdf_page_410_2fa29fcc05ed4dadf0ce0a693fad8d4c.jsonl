Conclusion
The European conflicts of the twentieth century took many formsfrom civil 
armed conflicts to ideological cultural and propaganda rivalries during the 
Cold War Compared to previous centuries however the main European 
wars of the twentieth century took on a global character with significant 
consequences for nonEuropean territories European civil wars of the last 
century were always subject to foreign intervention of varying degrees of 
explicitness in some cases calling into question the underpinnings of the 
nation and the coherence of the imagined community Memories of war still 
evoke controversies and occupy an important place in national narratives 
public discourses and the foreign policy orientations of todays European 
states Peacebuilding processes and the peace movements belong to modern 
European history just as much as the conflicts however they were often 
abused for political or ideological purposes or culminated in more division 
and disagreement
