Introduction
Borders in the modern senseconceived as a fusion of political taxation and 
customs jurisdictionsonly began developing during the nineteenth century 
undergoing a process of clarification and narrowing down as part of state 
centralisation At the start of the modern era a variety of physical borders 
were still to be found across Europe there were hedges and fences running 
along fallow land there were illdefined stretches of border that were no 
more than open fields There were also broad borders that were well into the 
nineteenth century in the case of Eastern Europe practically no more than 
wood or marshland On the other hand there were imperial borderlands the 
great swathes of territory that bounded the European continental empires the 
Habsburg Tsarist Ottoman and German Empires and where they clashed 
with one another These remained fluid zones with ebbing and flowing lines 
of political domination resulting in a huge buildup of tension and friction 
that spilled over into the twentieth century 
The wide porous and fluid borders of the early modern period gradually 
transformed during the nineteenth century into more definitive frontier 
lines The dynastic principle of domination was meanwhile replaced with 
a geopolitical one in which territorial units became more important than 
dynastic connections Loyalty to a state to a defined land or territory and 
eventually to the nation now came before the allegiance to a monarch
Geopolitical Transformation
In geopolitical terms the map of Europe changed drastically at the turn of 
the nineteenth century Following the French Revolution 17891799 and 
the Napoleonic Wars 18031815 new states and new borders emerged and 
disappeared within the span of a few years sometimes overnight
