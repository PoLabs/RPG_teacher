In many ways the move towards higher levels of abstraction in fine art from 
realism to cubism was a reaction to the changes in European society in the 
nineteenth century The confrontation with new technology most importantly 
photography but also with new ideas about individualism and the inner self 
seemed to make the conventional European tradition of painting obsolete and 
demanded a new mode of expression
Literature
In literature likewise realism and impressionism were stages in the process of 
abstraction Literary realism aimed to represent the totality of contemporary 
society by depicting the quotidian ordinary lives of people of all classes In their 
attempt to portray reality truthfully and objectively realist writers embraced 
the growing importance of science and technology in nineteenthcentury 
society The French novelist Honor de Balzac 17991850 sought to emulate 
the scientific method of observation in his writing and in a similar vein the 
British writer George Eliot 18191880 defined realism as the doctrine that all 
truth and beauty are to be attained by a humble and faithful study of nature 
In her works Eliot went to great lengths to capture the specific regional dialects 
of her characters While her novels were mostly set in the countryside many 
realist writers focused on the conditions of the urban poor The French author 
Victor Hugo 18021885 and the British novelist Charles Dickens 18121870 
whose works often focused on the misery and squalor of the underclass in 
Paris and London respectively were arguably the most influential artists of 
their time shaping popular opinion on the needs of social reform
Naturalist authors such as Zola and the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov 
18601904 took this reformist impulse even further Influenced by the theory 
of evolution formulated by the British biologist Charles Darwin 18091882 
naturalism sought to identify the underlying forces that shaped the actions of 
its characters rather than just describing subjects truthfully
In many ways literary impressionism was a direct outgrowth of realism 
and naturalism The aim was still to observe and represent a subject in as much 
detail as possible however the focus was no longer on the material or social 
world but on subjective impressions and experiences Rather than social 
totality literary impressionism aimed for perceptual totality This subjective 
viewpoint makes the meaning and even the course of events ambiguous 
and leaves much room for the reader to draw their own conclusions Works 
by literary impressionists such as the PolishBritish writer Joseph Conrad 
18571914 and the French author Marcel Proust 18711922 experimented 
with many formal innovations such as stream of consciousness nonlinear 
timelines multiple narrators and visual imagery
