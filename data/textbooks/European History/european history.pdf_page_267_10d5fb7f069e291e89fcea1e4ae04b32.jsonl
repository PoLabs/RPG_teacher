24 INEQUALITIES

disability was strong congenital and acquired disability were both found 
across boundaries of class and economic wellbeing Disability thus constitutes 
an axis of inequality in its own right 
This period saw the growth of what we might tentatively call special 
education In late eighteenthcentury Paris the Abb CharlesMichel de LEpe 
watching deaf Parisians conversing with each other in the street using sign 
language was inspired to develop a form of deaf education that used a manual 
sign language A few years later in Scotland Thomas Braidwood founded 
the first school for the deaf in the British Isles After a rather hesitant start 
by the midnineteenth century deaf people previously seen as uneducable 
were increasingly being taught in schools and institutions using a diversity 
of methods including both manual systems which used sign language and 
oral systems which focussed on lipreading Teachers of these methods 
across Europe became increasingly antagonistic towards each other and in 
1880 an international conference was held in Milan The conference aimed 
to advocate oralism as a superior method of deaf education a controversial 
move that has since been accredited by many deaf historians not only as a 
demonstration of the low regard in which sign languages were held but also 
as a direct contribution to the alienation of and discrimination against the deaf 
community Blind education also developed in this period across Europe with 
Louis Brailles new system of writing in France completed in 1829 being a 
particularly important development internationally
Alongside educational institutions for disabled people the nineteenth 
century also saw the increased institutionalisation of disabled people for other 
reasons In Britain the workhouses introduced in 1834 ostensibly to deal 
with poverty housed vast numbers of disabled people in terrible conditions 
Specialist institutions and asylums for disabled people also grew sometimes 
under the pretext of providing specialist care They also performed a function 
in allowing nondisabled family members to remove stigmatised disabled 
relatives from the household Psychiatric illnesses and mental distress were also 
addressed for the first time in a systematic manner in the nineteenth century 
through the creation of socalled insane asylums institutions that aimed to 
achieve at best the recovery of people with mental illness or at least their 
containment The quality of life in these institutions varied enormously and 
was also shaped by class and economic wellbeing Some were highly abusive 
institutions whilst others provided a more wellintentioned if in many ways 
deficient standard of living Gender too heavily inflected the experience of 
life in institutions of all sorts with female inmates often enlisted to help with 
the domestic running of the institution whilst male inmates were instructed in 
other forms of early occupational therapy such as woodwork
