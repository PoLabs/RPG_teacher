The year 1882 when the eighth and last impressionist exhibition took place 
marked the beginning of the phase that immediately prepared abstraction and 
that we label as postimpressionism These following decades embraced the 
activity of les Fauves the Wild Beasts a group of painters officially existing 
between 1905 and 1908 who further developed the simultaneously fuzzy 
and vibrating formal language of impressionists While the starting point for 
les Fauves was also the subjectively observed view they unlike Monet and 
his group did not stop there and associated the view with bold radically 
unnatural colours that matched their actual sentiments Some of the Fauvist 
paintings were overcome by emotions to such an extent that the compositions 
fell apart in almost unidentifiable masses of brush strokes The French painter 
Paul Czanne 18391906 who did not associate himself with any of the 
avantgarde groups and schools contributed at least as much to the birth of 
abstraction as les Fauves together In the course of this quest to explore new 
avenues of visual expression including the famous series of Mont Sainte
Victoire 19041906 Czanne reached a stage where his paintings became 
nearly gridlike compositions encompassing elemental geometrical forms 
circles triangles and cubes He died in 1906 but his innovations had laid the 
foundations for cubism the first abstract art style invented only a year later 
by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso 18811973 and the French artist Georges 
Braque 18821963
