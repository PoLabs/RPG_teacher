Introduction
Confronted with resource scarcity industrialisation and colonial exploitation 
Europeans in the nineteenth century conceptualised and experienced the 
natural world in new ways In scientific and political discourse the notion 
emerged that man depended on a fragile and interconnected system which 
needed to be used wisely and preserved in order to endure Nineteenth
century ideas about ecological limits to growth sustainable use of resources 
and intrinsic links between the economy society and the natural environment 
provided the conceptual building blocks for the sustainability discourse which 
shaped environmental thinking in the twentieth century
From the eighteenth century onwards there emerged two distinct views of 
nature which environmental historian Donald Worster has called imperial 
and arcadian The imperial tradition with intellectual roots in Francis Bacons 
natural philosophy and underpinned by Gods proclamation in Genesis 128 to 
fill the earth and subdue it gave mankind authority over all living creatures 
and scientific and technological means with which it could master exploit 
and control nature This humancentred view most strongly expressed in 
Carl Linnaeus 17071778 Systema Naturae 1735 remained influential in the 
nineteenth century It provided a rationale for everincreasing state intervention 
in managing natural resources Below the surface however a parallel arcadian 
tradition imaginedin the words of Worstera simple humble life for man 
with the aim of restoring him to a peaceful coexistence with other organisms
