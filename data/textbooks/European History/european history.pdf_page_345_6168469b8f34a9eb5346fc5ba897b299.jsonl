32 EMPIRE AND COLONIALISM
325
territories were fully incorporated within European state structures some 
received different levels of autonomy In most cases there is consensus about 
remaining subject to European administration
European ThirdWorldism
Most of the first generation of anticolonial leaders were educated in Europe 
There they also adopted the notions of a European nationstate and other 
concepts used for building the postcolonial countries and sometimes they 
were criticised by later generations of postindependence leaders However 
transfers of knowledge and cultural patterns flowed both ways Since the late 
1950s the Western European left increasingly looked for inspiration in places 
other than the Soviet Union gradually turning to the Third World It was 
intellectuals like Frantz Fanon a Martinican psychiatrist who demanded the 
dismantling of colonial empires even at the cost of violence who left a strong 
impact on the European left ThirdWorldism became a cornerstone of the 
New Left and protest movements that peaked in the late1960s From Algeria 
the focus turned to Angola and Mozambique to the apartheid regime in South 
Africa and most of all to Vietnam Solidarity campaigns and protests against 
the US war in Indochina were perhaps the most visible feature of the student 
movement In the Third Worldist perspective the European proletariat 
was no longer the class that was supposed to lead the revolution as it had 
become too comfortable in the system The new hopes were placed in the rural 
population of the Global South the damned of the Earth Frantz Fanon 
The theories of Mao Zedong Che Guevara or Rgis Debray were attractive 
because they presented not only an alternative to capitalism but also to the 
Soviet bureaucratic socialism which was seen as discreditedparticularly 
after the interventions in Hungary and Czechoslovakia 
Conclusion
Decolonisation is one of the most significant global processes of the twentieth 
century Different kinds of rule in colonial territories gave rise to different 
kinds of decolonisation While formal independence has been achieved 
in most parts of the world there are still many remnants and longterm 
ramifications of colonialism We can still see efforts to maintain asymmetric 
special relationships between former colonial powers and their former 
colonies The consequences of colonialism can be observed in international 
migration and formation of transnational identities The emancipation process 
in the Third World also affected conceptualisations of a global revolution 
among European leftists
