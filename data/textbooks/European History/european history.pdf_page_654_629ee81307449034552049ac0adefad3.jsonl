must have been a factor too However early modern views on the matter were 
much more complicated 
First there were plenty of powerful ideological positions against 
consumerism Christian teaching was opposed to individual acquisitiveness 
to excess and to unnecessary indulgence It preached instead the importance 
of charity moderation and modesty These messages were reinforced by 
the civic humanist valorisation of citizenship virtue and temperance over 
luxury and selfgratification and by the assumption that men and women 
should dress eat drink and live according to their social position and place 
avoiding the perils of novelty and fashion In the face of these proscriptions it 
was neither easy nor straightforward to be a consumer in early modern Europe 
Second early modern commentators were also very conscious that consumer 
decisions varied from place to place and were shaped not simply by personal 
desires and ideological controls but also by what we would understand 
today as cultural factors that were geographically and socially specific To 
that end there was an extensive early modern vocabulary describing the 
particularities of everyday material and comestible culture the world of goods 
was very much regarded as part of the customs habits practices rituals 
and ceremonies by which and through which individuals households and 
communities lived their lives Third when early modern commentators moved 
beyond the cultural relativism of customs and practices and looked to explain 
consumption in singular and universalistic terms they tended to reach for 
the concept of emulation By this they simply meant the human propensity 
for social imitation whereby the customs and practices of one social group 
were admired and copied by others Most usually the direction of travel was 
assumed to be downwards with the lower orders admiring and adopting the 
behaviour of the elites whenever possible as William Prynne noted in 1628 
Inferiors  commonly adore their Superiors chief and greatest vices as 
so many glorious and resplendent virtues But emulation could also be trans
cultural with Englands consumer revolution after 1660 often explained by 
contemporaries as the successful emulation of the Dutch
Conclusion
It is striking that when early modern historians rediscovered consumption as 
a key feature of Europes economic history they also reached for theories of 
emulation to explain the proliferation of watches coffeepots bookcases silks 
linens cottons porcelain glass tableware cutlery and so on Most influentially 
it was argued that after 1650 the potent combination of colonial groceries 
and populuxe goods tempted the middling and lowerclass households of 
Northwestern Europe to fundamentally alter their habits of consumption by
