as well a fundamental change occurred as a result of decolonisation crises 
when in 1958 the Fourth Republic weakened by defeat in the Indochina War 
and the ongoing Algerian War collapsed It was replaced by the Fifth Republic 
under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle who however needed until 1962 
to consolidate his presidency against domestic crises and the threat of an 
impending military coup
Western European societies long refused to face up to their colonial past 
including the legacies of conflictridden decolonisation The dissolution of the 
empires was followed by a long phase of amnesia and deliberate neglect of 
colonial crimes and human rights violations Only since the 2000s has a more 
conscious reappraisal which is far from being completed begun It includes 
questions of memory culture and politicalhistorical education as well as the 
eminently political demands of the formerly colonised for the restitution of 
artifacts works of art and human remains as well as for reparations 
Neocolonialism and Remnants of the Empires
Europes influence on its former colonies did not cease to exist with their 
formal independence In many areas the former mother country kept a

also holds a record in the number of military interventions and covert coups 
often using mercenaries in SubSaharan Africa
More subtle ways of exercising influence over the postcolonial states were 
also employed The Central African and West African CFA franc that has been 
pegged to the French francand later the Eurois perhaps the most blatant 
example of the structural impact a European country can have on its former 
colonies trade and monetary policies Since the 1980s many postcolonial 
countries became heavily indebted to the International Monetary Fund or 
the World Bank the money however came with obligations of structural 
adjustments The institutions to a large extent under the control of Europe 
and North America thus created new neocolonial tools enabling the North 
to maintain the upper hand over the South
Even though most colonial holdings have been abandoned over the course 
of the twentieth century there are still remnants of the empires such as the 
Canary Islands and Madeira in Africa several British French and Dutch 
territories in the Caribbean British and French islands in the Indian and 
Pacific oceans and even Danish dominion over Greenland Some of these
