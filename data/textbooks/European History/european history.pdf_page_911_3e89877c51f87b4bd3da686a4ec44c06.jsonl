Many modern sports and games originated in the late Middle Ages and 
early modern times As suggested by the etymology of the word sport coming

an opportunity for people to enjoy their free time Some of them were simple 
pastimes enjoyedusually on Sundaysby peasants and the labouring 
classes since that was often the only day when they were not forced to work 
This custom was often regarded with great dismay by church officials who
