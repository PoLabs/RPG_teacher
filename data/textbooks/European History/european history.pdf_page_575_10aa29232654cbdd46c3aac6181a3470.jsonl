1972 hosted by the Swedish government in Stockholm Most of the Western 
and former Third World countries took part in the Stockholm conference but 
the Soviet Union and its allies mainly boycotted it for Cold War diplomatic 
reasons At the conference the UN established its Environment Programme 
UNEP which is now based in Nairobi Kenya The conference adopted a 
declaration whose ecological ideas had first been introduced at the UN 
Conference on Man and the Biosphere in 1968 in Paris One of its principles was 
the Polluter Pays Principle PPP by which those who cause pollutionand 
not those who have to suffer its consequencesare responsible for covering 
the costs of eliminating or compensating for the resulting problems But the 
PPP and other recommendations of the UNCHE did not become international 
law in the 1970s Even today introducing preventive technology remains a 
controversial topic
The UNCHE in 1972 was a starting point for the establishment of national 
environmental institutions like ministries or agencies as well as international 
environmental diplomacy management and law In the last three decades 
of the twentieth century Conventions on the Protection of the Wetlands 
1971 on World Heritage 1972 on Flora and Fauna 1973 on Longrange 
Transboundary Air Pollution 1979 on the Protection of the Ozone Layer 
1987 and on the Regulation of the Disposal of Hazardous Waste 1989 
were adopted The second worldwide UN Conference on Environment and 
Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 enshrined the concept of sustainable 
development in international law A direct successful consequence of this 
conference was the 1997 Kyoto Protocol a major diplomatic contribution to 
the fight against global warming 
Environmentalism Popularisation and Protest
Environmentalism was not however simply a question of science or a matter of 
high politics but a set of concerns that also animated social movements across 
Europe and beyond Environmentalists have sometimes worked closely with 
governments and often used science in order to create pressure for political 
action However they have just as frequently challenged state policies and 
worked to develop their own independent expertise in order to call industry 
scientists into question
After the Second World War environmental problems became increasingly 
difficult to ignore as competition between the two Cold War blocs accelerated 
industrialisation and worsened pollution In parallel advancements in 
technology mass media and economic globalisation fostered a new sense 
of global interconnectedness one which was dramatically illustrated for 
example by photos of the Earth from space Earthrise 1968 Within Europe 
oil spills from ships like the Torrey Canyon 1967 and Amoco Cadiz 1978 in the
