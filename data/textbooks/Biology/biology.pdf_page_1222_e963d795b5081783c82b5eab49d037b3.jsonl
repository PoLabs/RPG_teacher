site on myosin regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites
on actin molecules preventing crossbridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous
input Troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule it also binds calcium ions
To enable a muscle contraction tropomyosin must change conformation uncovering the myosinbinding site on
an actin molecule and allowing crossbridge formation This can only happen in the presence of calcium which
is kept at extremely low concentrations in the sarcoplasm If present calcium ions bind to troponin causing
conformational changes in troponin that allow tropomyosin to move away from the myosin binding sites on actin
Once the tropomyosin is removed a crossbridge can form between actin and myosin triggering contraction
Crossbridge cycling continues until Ca2 ions and ATP are no longer available and tropomyosin again covers
the binding sites on actin
ExcitationContraction Coupling
Excitationcontraction coupling is the link transduction between the action potential generated in the
sarcolemma and the start of a muscle contraction The trigger for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic
reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural signal Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor neuron
which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to the muscle The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle
fiber that interacts with the neuron is called the motor end plate The end of the neurons axon is called the
synaptic terminal and it does not actually contact the motor end plate A small space called the synaptic cleft
separates the synaptic terminal from the motor end plate Electrical signals travel along the neurons axon which
branches through the muscle and connects to individual muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction
The ability of cells to communicate electrically requires that the cells expend energy to create an electrical
gradient across their cell membranes This charge gradient is carried by ions which are differentially distributed
across the membrane Each ion exerts an electrical influence and a concentration influence Just as milk will
eventually mix with coffee without the need to stir ions also distribute themselves evenly if they are permitted to
do so In this case they are not permitted to return to an evenly mixed state
The sodiumpotassium ATPase uses cellular energy to move K ions inside the cell and Na ions outside This
alone accumulates a small electrical charge but a big concentration gradient There is lots of K in the cell and
lots of Na outside the cell Potassium is able to leave the cell through K channels that are open 90 of the
time and it does However Na channels are rarely open so Na remains outside the cell When K leaves
the cell obeying its concentration gradient that effectively leaves a negative charge behind So at rest there
is a large concentration gradient for Na to enter the cell and there is an accumulation of negative charges
left behind in the cell This is the resting membrane potential Potential in this context means a separation
of electrical charge that is capable of doing work It is measured in volts just like a battery However the
transmembrane potential is considerably smaller 007 V therefore the small value is expressed as millivolts
mV or 70 mV Because the inside of a cell is negative compared with the outside a minus sign signifies the
excess of negative charges inside the cell 70 mV
If an event changes the permeability of the membrane to Na ions they will enter the cell That will change
the voltage This is an electrical event called an action potential that can be used as a cellular signal
Communication occurs between nerves and muscles through neurotransmitters Neuron action potentials cause
the release of neurotransmitters from the synaptic terminal into the synaptic cleft where they can then diffuse
across the synaptic cleft and bind to a receptor molecule on the motor end plate The motor end plate possesses
junctional foldsfolds in the sarcolemma that create a large surface area for the neurotransmitter to bind to
receptors The receptors are actually sodium channels that open to allow the passage of Na into the cell when
they receive a neurotransmitter signal
Acetylcholine ACh is a neurotransmitter released by motor neurons that binds to receptors in the motor end
plate Neurotransmitter release occurs when an action potential travels down the motor neurons axon resulting
in altered permeability of the synaptic terminal membrane and an influx of calcium The Ca2 ions allow synaptic
vesicles to move to and bind with the presynaptic membrane on the neuron and release neurotransmitter from
the vesicles into the synaptic cleft Once released by the synaptic terminal ACh diffuses across the synaptic
cleft to the motor end plate where it binds with ACh receptors As a neurotransmitter binds these ion channels
open and Na ions cross the membrane into the muscle cell This reduces the voltage difference between
the inside and outside of the cell which is called depolarization As ACh binds at the motor end plate this
depolarization is called an endplate potential The depolarization then spreads along the sarcolemma creating
an action potential as sodium channels adjacent to the initial depolarization site sense the change in voltage and
