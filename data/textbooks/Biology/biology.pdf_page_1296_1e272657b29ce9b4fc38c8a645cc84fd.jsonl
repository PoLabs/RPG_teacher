Figure 417 Each part of the nephron performs a different function in filtering waste and maintaining homeostatic
balance 1 The glomerulus forces small solutes out of the blood by pressure 2 The proximal convoluted tubule
reabsorbs ions water and nutrients from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid and actively transports toxins and drugs
from the interstitial fluid into the filtrate The proximal convoluted tubule also adjusts blood pH by selectively secreting
ammonia NH3 into the filtrate where it reacts with H to form NH4 The more acidic the filtrate the more ammonia
is secreted 3 The descending loop of Henle is lined with cells containing aquaporins that allow water to pass from
the filtrate into the interstitial fluid 4 In the thin part of the ascending loop of Henle Na and Cl ions diffuse into the
interstitial fluid In the thick part these same ions are actively transported into the interstitial fluid Because salt but not
water is lost the filtrate becomes more dilute as it travels up the limb 5 In the distal convoluted tubule K and H ions
are selectively secreted into the filtrate while Na Cl and HCO3 ions are reabsorbed to maintain pH and electrolyte
balance in the blood 6 The collecting duct reabsorbs solutes and water from the filtrate forming dilute urine credit

Glomerular Filtration
Glomerular filtration filters out most of the solutes due to high blood pressure and specialized membranes in
the afferent arteriole The blood pressure in the glomerulus is maintained independent of factors that affect
systemic blood pressure The leaky connections between the endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary
network allow solutes to pass through easily All solutes in the glomerular capillaries except for macromolecules
like proteins pass through by passive diffusion There is no energy requirement at this stage of the filtration
process Glomerular filtration rate GFR is the volume of glomerular filtrate formed per minute by the kidneys
GFR is regulated by multiple mechanisms and is an important indicator of kidney function
