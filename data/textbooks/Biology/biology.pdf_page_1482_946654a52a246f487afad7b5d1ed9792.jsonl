level from the primary producers to the apex consumers Many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate
including the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane DDT which was described in the 1960s bestseller
Silent Spring by Rachel Carson DDT was a commonly used pesticide before its dangers became known In
some aquatic ecosystems organisms from each trophic level consumed many organisms of the lower level
which caused DDT to increase in birds apex consumers that ate fish Thus the birds accumulated sufficient
amounts of DDT to cause fragility in their eggshells This effect increased egg breakage during nesting and was
shown to have adverse effects on these bird populations The use of DDT was banned in the United States in
the 1970s
Other substances that biomagnify are polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs which were used in coolant liquids in
the United States until their use was banned in 1979 and heavy metals such as mercury lead and cadmium
These substances were best studied in aquatic ecosystems where fish species at different trophic levels
accumulate toxic substances brought through the ecosystem by the primary producers As illustrated in a study
performed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA in the Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron
Figure 4611 PCB concentrations increased from the ecosystems primary producers phytoplankton through
the different trophic levels of fish species The apex consumer walleye has more than four times the amount of
PCBs compared to phytoplankton Also based on results from other studies birds that eat these fish may have
PCB levels at least one order of magnitude higher than those found in the lake fish
Figure 4611 This chart shows the PCB concentrations found at the various trophic levels in the Saginaw Bay
ecosystem of Lake Huron Numbers on the xaxis reflect enrichment with heavy isotopes of nitrogen 15N which is a
marker for increasing trophic level Notice that the fish in the higher trophic levels accumulate more PCBs than those
in lower trophic levels credit Patricia Van Hoof NOAA GLERL
Other concerns have been raised by the accumulation of heavy metals such as mercury and cadmium in certain
types of seafood The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA recommends that pregnant women
and young children should not consume any swordfish shark king mackerel or tilefish because of their high
mercury content These individuals are advised to eat fish low in mercury salmon tilapia shrimp pollock and
catfish Biomagnification is a good example of how ecosystem dynamics can affect our everyday lives even
influencing the food we eat
