KEY TERMS
series of biochemical reactions that the sperm uses to break through the zona pellucida
form of reproduction that produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent
structure formed when cells in the mammalian blastula separate into an inner and outer layer
form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell leading to a separation
from the original animal into two individuals
secretion that cleanses the urethra prior to ejaculation
sensory structure in females stimulated during sexual arousal
common body opening for the digestive excretory and reproductive systems found in nonmammals
such as birds
also birth control various means used to prevent pregnancy
reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth ovulation and calcium
absorption
fertilization of egg by sperm outside animal body often during spawning
also binary fission method by which multicellular organisms increase in size or asexual reproduction in
which a unicellular organism splits into two separate organisms by mitosis
reproductive hormone that causes sperm production in men and follicle
development in women
cutting or fragmenting of the original animal into parts and the growth of a separate animal from
each part
process in which the blastula folds over itself to form the three germ layers
length of time for fetal development to birth
hormone from the hypothalamus that causes the release of FSH
and LH from the anterior pituitary
state of having both male and female reproductive parts within the same individual
complete cleavage takes place in cells with a small amount of yolk
hormone produced by the chorion of the zygote that helps to
maintain the corpus luteum and elevated levels of progesterone
inability to conceive carry and deliver children
hormone made by Sertoli cells provides negative feedback to hypothalamus in control of FSH and
GnRH release
inner layer of cells in the blastocyst
fertilization of egg by sperm inside the body of the female
cell in seminiferous tubules that makes testosterone
