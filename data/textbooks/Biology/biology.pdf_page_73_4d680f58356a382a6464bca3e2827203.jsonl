KEY TERMS
molecule that donates hydrogen ions and increases the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution
attraction between water molecules and other molecules
hydrocarbon consisting of a linear chain of carbon atoms
negative ion that is formed by an atom gaining one or more electrons
hydrocarbon consisting of closed rings of carbon atoms
the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element
calculated mean of the mass number for an elements isotopes
total number of protons in an atom
statement of a chemical reaction with the number of each type of atom equalized
for both the products and reactants
molecule that donates hydroxide ions or otherwise binds excess hydrogen ions and decreases the
hydrogen ions concentration in a solution
substance that prevents a change in pH by absorbing or releasing hydrogen or hydroxide ions
amount of heat required to change the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius
occurs because water molecules are attracted to charges on the inner surfaces of narrow
tubular structures such as glass tubes drawing the water molecules to the tubes sides
positive ion that is formed by an atom losing one or more electrons
interaction between two or more of the same or different atoms that results in forming molecules
process leading to rearranging atoms in molecules
the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other
intermolecular forces between water molecules caused by the polar nature of water responsible for
surface tension
substance composed of molecules consisting of atoms of at least two different elements
type of strong bond formed between two atoms of the same or different elements forms when
electrons are shared between atoms
release of an ion from a molecule such that the original molecule now consists of an ion and the
charged remains of the original such as when water dissociates into H and OH
ion necessary for nerve impulse conduction muscle contractions and water balance
negatively charged subatomic particle that resides outside of the nucleus in the electron orbital lacks
functional mass and has a negative charge of 1 unit
arrangement of electrons in an atoms electron shell for example 1s22s22p6
how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus the area where we are most
likely to find an electron
movement of electrons from one element to another important in creating ionic bonds
ability of some elements to attract electrons often of hydrogen atoms acquiring partial
