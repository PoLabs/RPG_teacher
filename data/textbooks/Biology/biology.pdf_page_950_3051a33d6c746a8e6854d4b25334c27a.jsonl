Because GAs are produced by the seeds and because fruit development and stem elongation are under GA
control these varieties of grapes would normally produce small fruit in compact clusters Maturing grapes are
routinely treated with GA to promote larger fruit size as well as looser bunches longer stems which reduces
the instance of mildew infection Figure 3040

Abscisic Acid
The plant hormone abscisic acid ABA was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping
of cotton bolls However more recent studies indicate that ABA plays only a minor role in the abscission process
ABA accumulates as a response to stressful environmental conditions such as dehydration cold temperatures
or shortened day lengths Its activity counters many of the growthpromoting effects of GAs and auxins ABA
inhibits stem elongation and induces dormancy in lateral buds
ABA induces dormancy in seeds by blocking germination and promoting the synthesis of storage proteins
Plants adapted to temperate climates require a long period of cold temperature before seeds germinate This
mechanism protects young plants from sprouting too early during unseasonably warm weather in winter As
the hormone gradually breaks down over winter the seed is released from dormancy and germinates when
conditions are favorable in spring Another effect of ABA is to promote the development of winter buds it
mediates the conversion of the apical meristem into a dormant bud Low soil moisture causes an increase in
ABA which causes stomata to close reducing water loss in winter buds
Ethylene
Ethylene is associated with fruit ripening flower wilting and leaf fall Ethylene is unusual because it is a volatile
gas C2H4 Hundreds of years ago when gas street lamps were installed in city streets trees that grew close to
lamp posts developed twisted thickened trunks and shed their leaves earlier than expected These effects were
caused by ethylene volatilizing from the lamps
Aging tissues especially senescing leaves and nodes of stems produce ethylene The bestknown effect of the
hormone however is the promotion of fruit ripening Ethylene stimulates the conversion of starch and acids to
sugars Some people store unripe fruit such as avocadoes in a sealed paper bag to accelerate ripening the
gas released by the first fruit to mature will speed up the maturation of the remaining fruit Ethylene also triggers
leaf and fruit abscission flower fading and dropping and promotes germination in some cereals and sprouting
of bulbs and potatoes
