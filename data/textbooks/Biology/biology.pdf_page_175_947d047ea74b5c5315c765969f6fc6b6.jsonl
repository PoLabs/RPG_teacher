Figure 522 In receptormediated endocytosis the cells uptake of substances targets a single type of substance that
binds to the receptor on the cell membranes external surface credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal
In receptormediated endocytosis as in phagocytosis clathrin attaches to the plasma membranes
cytoplasmic side If a compounds uptake is dependent on receptormediated endocytosis and the process is
ineffective the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood Instead it will stay in those fluids
and increase in concentration The failure of receptormediated endocytosis causes some human diseases For
example receptor mediated endocytosis removes low density lipoprotein or LDL or bad cholesterol from the
blood In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia the LDL receptors are defective or missing
entirely People with this condition have lifethreatening levels of cholesterol in their blood because their cells
cannot clear LDL particles
Although receptormediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally in the
extracellular fluid into the cell other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site Flu viruses
diphtheria and cholera toxin all have sites that crossreact with normal receptorbinding sites and gain entry into
cells
