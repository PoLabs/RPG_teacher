Changing Human Behavior
Legislation throughout the world has been enacted to protect species The legislation includes international
treaties as well as national and state laws The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora CITES treaty came into force in 1975 The treaty and the national legislation that supports
it provides a legal framework for preventing approximately 33000 listed species from being transported across
nations borders thus protecting them from being caught or killed when international trade is involved The treaty
is limited in its reach because it only deals with international movement of organisms or their parts It is also
limited by various countries ability or willingness to enforce the treaty and supporting legislation The illegal trade
in organisms and their parts is probably a market in the hundreds of millions of dollars Illegal wildlife trade is
monitored by another nonprofit Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce TRAFFIC
Within many countries there are laws that protect endangered species and regulate hunting and fishing In the
United States the Endangered Species Act ESA was enacted in 1973 Species at risk are listed by the Act
the US Fish  Wildlife Service is required by law to develop plans that protect the listed species and bring
them back to sustainable numbers The Act and others like it in other countries is a useful tool but it suffers
because it is often difficult to get a species listed or to get an effective management plan in place once it is listed
Additionally species may be controversially taken off the list without necessarily having had a change in their
situation More fundamentally the approach to protecting individual species rather than entire ecosystems is
both inefficient and focuses efforts on a few highly visible and often charismatic species perhaps at the expense
of other species that go unprotected At the same time the Act has a critical habitat provision outlined in the
recovery mechanism that may benefit species other than the one targeted for management
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act MBTA is an agreement between the United States and Canada that was signed
into law in 1918 in response to declines in North American bird species caused by hunting The Act now lists
over 800 protected species It makes it illegal to disturb or kill the protected species or distribute their parts much
of the hunting of birds in the past was for their feathers
