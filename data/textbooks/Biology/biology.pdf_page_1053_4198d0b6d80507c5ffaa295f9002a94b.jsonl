polypeptides it also helps activate more pepsinogen starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates
more pepsin Another cell typeparietal cellssecrete hydrogen and chloride ions which combine in the lumen
to form hydrochloric acid the primary acidic component of the stomach juices Hydrochloric acid helps to convert
the inactive pepsinogen to pepsin The highly acidic environment also kills many microorganisms in the food
and combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin results in the hydrolysis of protein in the food Chemical
digestion is facilitated by the churning action of the stomach Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles
mixes the stomach contents about every 20 minutes The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is
called chyme Chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine Further protein digestion takes place in
the small intestine Gastric emptying occurs within two to six hours after a meal Only a small amount of chyme
is released into the small intestine at a time The movement of chyme from the stomach into the small intestine
is regulated by the pyloric sphincter
When digesting protein and some fats the stomach lining must be protected from getting digested by pepsin
There are two points to consider when describing how the stomach lining is protected First as previously
mentioned the enzyme pepsin is synthesized in the inactive form This protects the chief cells because
pepsinogen does not have the same enzyme functionality of pepsin Second the stomach has a thick mucus
lining that protects the underlying tissue from the action of the digestive juices When this mucus lining is
ruptured ulcers can form in the stomach Ulcers are open wounds in or on an organ caused by bacteria
Helicobacter pylori when the mucus lining is ruptured and fails to reform
Small Intestine
Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of
protein fats and carbohydrates is completed The small intestine is a long tubelike organ with a highly folded
surface containing fingerlike projections called the villi The apical surface of each villus has many microscopic
projections called microvilli These structures illustrated in Figure 3412 are lined with epithelial cells on the
luminal side and allow for the nutrients to be absorbed from the digested food and absorbed into the bloodstream
on the other side The villi and microvilli with their many folds increase the surface area of the intestine and
increase absorption efficiency of the nutrients Absorbed nutrients in the blood are carried into the hepatic portal
vein which leads to the liver There the liver regulates the distribution of nutrients to the rest of the body and
removes toxic substances including drugs alcohol and some pathogens
