331  Animal Form and Function
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the various types of body plans that occur in animals

Describe limits on animal size and shape

Relate bioenergetics to body size levels of activity and the environment
Animals vary in form and function From a sponge to a worm to a goat an organism has a distinct body plan
that limits its size and shape Animals bodies are also designed to interact with their environments whether in
the deep sea a rainforest canopy or the desert Therefore a large amount of information about the structure of
an organisms body anatomy and the function of its cells tissues and organs physiology can be learned by
studying that organisms environment
Body Plans
Figure 332 Animals exhibit different types of body symmetry The sponge is asymmetrical the sea anemone has
radial symmetry and the goat has bilateral symmetry
Animal body plans follow set patterns related to symmetry They are asymmetrical radial or bilateral in form
as illustrated in Figure 332 Asymmetrical animals are animals with no pattern or symmetry an example of
an asymmetrical animal is a sponge Radial symmetry as illustrated in Figure 332 describes when an animal
has an upanddown orientation any plane cut along its longitudinal axis through the organism produces equal
halves but not a definite right or left side This plan is found mostly in aquatic animals especially organisms that
attach themselves to a base like a rock or a boat and extract their food from the surrounding water as it flows
around the organism Bilateral symmetry is illustrated in the same figure by a goat The goat also has an upper
and lower component to it but a plane cut from front to back separates the animal into definite right and left
sides Additional terms used when describing positions in the body are anterior front posterior rear dorsal
toward the back and ventral toward the stomach Bilateral symmetry is found in both landbased and aquatic
animals it enables a high level of mobility
Limits on Animal Size and Shape
Animals with bilateral symmetry that live in water tend to have a fusiform shape this is a tubular shaped body
that is tapered at both ends This shape decreases the drag on the body as it moves through water and allows
the animal to swim at high speeds Table 331 lists the maximum speed of various animals Certain types of
sharks can swim at fifty kilometers per hour and some dolphins at 32 to 40 kilometers per hour Land animals
frequently travel faster although the tortoise and snail are significantly slower than cheetahs Another difference
in the adaptations of aquatic and landdwelling organisms is that aquatic organisms are constrained in shape
by the forces of drag in the water since water has higher viscosity than air On the other hand landdwelling
organisms are constrained mainly by gravity and drag is relatively unimportant For example most adaptations
in birds are for gravity not for drag
