range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms This is possible because some fish have evolved
osmoregulatory mechanisms to survive in all kinds of aquatic environments When they live in freshwater
their bodies tend to take up water because the environment is relatively hypotonic as illustrated in Figure
413a In such hypotonic environments these fish do not drink much water Instead they pass a lot of very
dilute urine and they achieve electrolyte balance by active transport of salts through the gills When they move
to a hypertonic marine environment these fish start drinking seawater they excrete the excess salts through
their gills and their urine as illustrated in Figure 413b Most marine invertebrates on the other hand may be
isotonic with seawater  osmoconformers Their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater
concentration Cartilaginous fishes salt composition of the blood is similar to bony fishes however the blood
of sharks contains the organic compounds urea and trimethylamine oxide TMAO This does not mean that
their electrolyte composition is similar to that of seawater They achieve isotonicity with the sea by storing large
concentrations of urea These animals that secrete urea are called ureotelic animals TMAO stabilizes proteins
in the presence of high urea levels preventing the disruption of peptide bonds that would occur in other animals
exposed to similar levels of urea Sharks are cartilaginous fish with a rectal gland to secrete salt and assist in
osmoregulation
