Figure 407 a Granulocytesincluding neutrophils eosinophils and basophilsare characterized by a lobed nucleus
and granular inclusions in the cytoplasm Granulocytes are typically firstresponders during injury or infection b
Agranulocytes include lymphocytes and monocytes Lymphocytes including B and T cells are responsible for adaptive
immune response Monocytes differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells which in turn respond to infection or
injury
Granulocytes contain granules in their cytoplasm the agranulocytes are so named because of the lack of
granules in their cytoplasm Some leukocytes become macrophages that either stay at the same site or move
through the bloodstream and gather at sites of infection or inflammation where they are attracted by chemical
signals from foreign particles and damaged cells Lymphocytes are the primary cells of the immune system and
include B cells T cells and natural killer cells B cells destroy bacteria and inactivate their toxins They also
produce antibodies T cells attack viruses fungi some bacteria transplanted cells and cancer cells T cells
attack viruses by releasing toxins that kill the viruses Natural killer cells attack a variety of infectious microbes
and certain tumor cells
One reason that HIV poses significant management challenges is because the virus directly targets T cells
by gaining entry through a receptor Once inside the cell HIV then multiplies using the T cells own genetic
machinery After the HIV virus replicates it is transmitted directly from the infected T cell to macrophages The
presence of HIV can remain unrecognized for an extensive period of time before full disease symptoms develop
Platelets and Coagulation Factors
Blood must clot to heal wounds and prevent excess blood loss Small cell fragments called platelets
thrombocytes are attracted to the wound site where they adhere by extending many projections and releasing
their contents These contents activate other platelets and also interact with other coagulation factors which
convert fibrinogen a watersoluble protein present in blood serum into fibrin a nonwater soluble protein
causing the blood to clot Many of the clotting factors require vitamin K to work and vitamin K deficiency can lead
to problems with blood clotting Many platelets converge and stick together at the wound site forming a platelet
plug also called a fibrin clot as illustrated in Figure 408b The plug or clot lasts for a number of days and
stops the loss of blood Platelets are formed from the disintegration of larger cells called megakaryocytes like
that shown in Figure 408a For each megakaryocyte 20003000 platelets are formed with 150000 to 400000
platelets present in each cubic millimeter of blood Each platelet is disc shaped and 24 m in diameter They
contain many small vesicles but do not contain a nucleus
