prokaryotic cells produced an additional membrane that surrounded the bacterial chromosome Some bacteria
have the DNA enclosed by two membranes however there is no evidence of a nucleolus or nuclear pores
Other proteobacteria also have membranebound chromosomes If the eukaryotic nucleus evolved this way we
would expect one of the two types of prokaryotes to be more closely related to eukaryotes
Figure 2014 The scientific community now widely accepts the theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts are
endosymbiotic in origin More controversial is the proposal that a the eukaryotic nucleus resulted from fusing archaeal
and bacterial genomes and that b Gramnegative bacteria which have two membranes resulted from fusing
Archaea and Grampositive bacteria each of which has a single membrane
The nucleusfirst hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first Figure 2015a followed by
a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria The mitochondriafirst hypothesis
proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host Figure 2015b which subsequently
acquired a nucleus by fusion or other mechanisms to become the first eukaryotic cell Most interestingly the
eukaryotefirst hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and
complexity Figure 2015c All of these hypotheses are testable Only time and more experimentation will
determine which hypothesis data best supports
