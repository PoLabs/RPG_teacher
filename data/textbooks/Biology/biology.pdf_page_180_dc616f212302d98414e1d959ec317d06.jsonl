type diffuses according to its own concentration gradient independent of other substances diffusing Many
factors can affect the diffusion rate such as concentration gradient diffusing particle sizes and the systems
temperature
In living systems the plasma membrane mediates substances diffusing in and out of cells Some materials
diffuse readily through the membrane but others are hindered and only can pass through due to specialized
proteins such as channels and transporters The chemistry of living things occurs in aqueous solutions and
balancing the concentrations of those solutions is an ongoing problem In living systems diffusing some
substances would be slow or difficult without membrane proteins that facilitate transport
53 Active Transport
The combined gradient that affects an ion includes its concentration gradient and its electrical gradient A
positive ion for example might diffuse into a new area down its concentration gradient but if it is diffusing into
an area of net positive charge its electrical gradient hampers its diffusion When dealing with ions in aqueous
solutions one must consider electrochemical and concentration gradient combinations rather than just the
concentration gradient alone Living cells need certain substances that exist inside the cell in concentrations
greater than they exist in the extracellular space Moving substances up their electrochemical gradients
requires energy from the cell Active transport uses energy stored in ATP to fuel this transport Active transport
of small molecularsized materials uses integral proteins in the cell membrane to move the materials These
proteins are analogous to pumps Some pumps which carry out primary active transport couple directly with
ATP to drive their action In cotransport or secondary active transport energy from primary transport can
move another substance into the cell and up its concentration gradient
54 Bulk Transport
Active transport methods require directly using ATP to fuel the transport In a process scientists call
phagocytosis other cells can engulf large particles such as macromolecules cell parts or whole cells In
phagocytosis a portion of the membrane invaginates and flows around the particle eventually pinching off and
leaving the particle entirely enclosed by a plasma membranes envelope The cell breaks down vesicle
contents with the particles either used as food or dispatched Pinocytosis is a similar process on a smaller
scale The plasma membrane invaginates and pinches off producing a small envelope of fluid from outside the
cell Pinocytosis imports substances that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid The cell expels waste in a
similar but reverse manner It pushes a membranous vacuole to the plasma membrane allowing the vacuole to
fuse with the membrane and incorporate itself into the membrane structure releasing its contents to the
exterior

the doctor thinks is an isotonic saline solution The
patient dies and an autopsy reveals that many red
blood cells have been destroyed Do you think the
solution the doctor injected was really isotonic
2 Figure 516 Injecting a potassium solution into a
persons blood is lethal Capital punishment and
euthanasia utilize this method in their subjects Why
do you think a potassium solution injection is lethal

would you expect the amount of amino acids
transported into the cell to increase or decrease
