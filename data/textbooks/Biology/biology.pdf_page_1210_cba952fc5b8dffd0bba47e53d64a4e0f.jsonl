is referred to as the synovial or joint cavity and is filled with synovial fluid Synovial fluid lubricates the joint
reducing friction between the bones and allowing for greater movement The ends of the bones are covered
with articular cartilage a hyaline cartilage and the entire joint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed
of connective tissue that allows movement of the joint while resisting dislocation Articular capsules may also
possess ligaments that hold the bones together Synovial joints are capable of the greatest movement of the
three structural joint types however the more mobile a joint the weaker the joint Knees elbows and shoulders
are examples of synovial joints
Figure 3825 Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space or synovial cavity in the joint
Classification of Joints on the Basis of Function
The functional classification divides joints into three categories synarthroses amphiarthroses and diarthroses
A synarthrosis is a joint that is immovable This includes sutures gomphoses and synchondroses
Amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement including syndesmoses and symphyses Diarthroses
are joints that allow for free movement of the joint as in synovial joints
Movement at Synovial Joints
The wide range of movement allowed by synovial joints produces different types of movements The movement
of synovial joints can be classified as one of four different types gliding angular rotational or special movement
Gliding Movement
Gliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other Gliding movements produce
very little rotation or angular movement of the bones The joints of the carpal and tarsal bones are examples of
joints that produce gliding movements
Angular Movement
Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes There are several
different types of angular movements including flexion extension hyperextension abduction adduction and
circumduction Flexion or bending occurs when the angle between the bones decreases Moving the forearm
upward at the elbow or moving the wrist to move the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion
Extension is the opposite of flexion in that the angle between the bones of a joint increases Straightening a
limb after flexion is an example of extension Extension past the regular anatomical position is referred to as
hyperextension This includes moving the neck back to look upward or bending the wrist so that the hand
moves away from the forearm
Abduction occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body Examples of abduction are moving
