Figure 331 Three components comprise a nucleotide a nitrogenous base a pentose sugar and one or more
phosphate groups Carbon residues in the pentose are numbered 1 through 5 the prime distinguishes these residues
from those in the base which are numbered without using a prime notation The base is attached to the riboses 1
position and the phosphate is attached to the 5 position When a polynucleotide forms the incoming nucleotides 5
phosphate attaches to the 3 hydroxyl group at the end of the growing chain Two types of pentose are in nucleotides
deoxyribose found in DNA and ribose found in RNA Deoxyribose is similar in structure to ribose but it has an H
instead of an OH at the 2 position We can divide bases into two categories purines and pyrimidines Purines have a
double ring structure and pyrimidines have a single ring
The nitrogenous bases important components of nucleotides are organic molecules and are so named because
they contain carbon and nitrogen They are bases because they contain an amino group that has the potential
of binding an extra hydrogen and thus decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration in its environment making it
more basic Each nucleotide in DNA contains one of four possible nitrogenous bases adenine A guanine G
cytosine C and thymine T
Scientists classify adenine and guanine as purines The purines primary structure is two carbonnitrogen rings
Scientists classify cytosine thymine and uracil as pyrimidines which have a single carbonnitrogen ring as
their primary structure Figure 331 Each of these basic carbonnitrogen rings has different functional groups
attached to it In molecular biology shorthand we know the nitrogenous bases by their symbols A T G C and
U DNA contains A T G and C whereas RNA contains A U G and C
The pentose sugar in DNA is deoxyribose and in RNA the sugar is ribose Figure 331 The difference
between the sugars is the presence of the hydroxyl group on the riboses second carbon and hydrogen on the
deoxyriboses second carbon The carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1 2 3 4 and 5 1
is read as one prime The phosphate residue attaches to the hydroxyl group of the 5 carbon of one sugar
and the hydroxyl group of the 3 carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide which forms a 53 phosphodiester
