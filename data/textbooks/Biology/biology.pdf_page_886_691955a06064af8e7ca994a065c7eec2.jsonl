Describe the evolutionary history of birds

Describe the derived characteristics in birds that facilitate flight
With over 10000 identified species the birds are the most speciose of the land vertebrate classes Abundant
research has shown that birds are really an extant clade that evolved from maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs
about 150 million years ago Thus even though the most obvious characteristic that seems to set birds apart
from other extant vertebrates is the presence of feathers we now know that feathers probably appeared in the
common ancestor of both ornithischian and saurischian lineages of dinosaurs Feathers in these clades are also
homologous to reptilian scales and mammalian hair according to the most recent research While the wings of
vertebrates like bats function without feathers birds rely on feathers and wings along with other modifications
of body structure and physiology for flight as we shall see
Characteristics of Birds
Birds are endothermic and more specifically homeothermicmeaning that they usually maintain an elevated
and constant body temperature which is significantly above the average body temperature of most mammals
This is in part due to the fact that active flightespecially the hovering skills of birds such as
hummingbirdsrequires enormous amounts of energy which in turn necessitates a high metabolic rate Like
mammals which are also endothermic and homeothermic and covered with an insulating pelage birds have
several different types of feathers that together keep heat infrared energy within the core of the body away
from the surface where it can be lost by radiation and convection to the environment
Modern birds produce two main types of feathers contour feathers and down feathers Contour feathers have
a number of parallel barbs that branch from a central shaft The barbs in turn have microscopic branches
called barbules that are linked together by minute hooks making the vane of a feather a strong flexible
and uninterrupted surface In contrast the barbules of down feathers do not interlock making these feathers
especially good for insulation trapping air in spaces between the loose interlocking barbules of adjacent
feathers to decrease the rate of heat loss by convection and radiation Certain parts of a birds body are covered
in down feathers and the base of other feathers has a downy portion whereas newly hatched birds are covered
almost entirely in down which serves as an excellent coat of insulation increasing the thermal boundary layer
between the skin and the outside environment
Feathers not only provide insulation but also allow for flight producing the lift and thrust necessary for flying
