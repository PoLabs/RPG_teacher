similarities occur not because of common ancestry but because of similar selection pressuresthe benefits of
predators not seeing them

Embryology the study of the anatomy of an organisms development to its adult form also provides evidence
of relatedness between now widely divergent groups of organisms Mutational tweaking in the embryo can have
such magnified consequences in the adult that tends to conserve embryo formation As a result structures that
are absent in some groups often appear in their embryonic forms and disappear when they reach the adult or
juvenile form For example all vertebrate embryos including humans exhibit gill slits and tails at some point in
their early development These disappear in the adults of terrestrial groups but adult forms of aquatic groups
such as fish and some amphibians maintain them Great ape embryos including humans have a tail structure
during their development that they lose when they are born
Biogeography
The geographic distribution of organisms on the planet follows patterns that we can explain best by evolution
in conjunction with tectonic plate movement over geological time Broad groups that evolved before the
supercontinent Pangaea broke up about 200 million years ago are distributed worldwide Groups that evolved
since the breakup appear uniquely in regions of the planet such as the unique flora and fauna of northern
continents that formed from the supercontinent Laurasia and of the southern continents that formed from the
supercontinent Gondwana The presence of members of the plant family Proteaceae in Australia southern
Africa and South America was most predominant prior to the southern supercontinent Gondwana breaking up
Marsupial diversification in Australia and the absence of other mammals reflect Australias long isolation
Australia has an abundance of endemic speciesspecies found nowhere elsewhich is typical of islands
whose isolation by expanses of water prevents species to migrate Over time these species diverge
evolutionarily into new species that look very different from their ancestors that may exist on the mainland
Australias marsupials the Galpagos finches and many species on the Hawaiian Islands are all unique to their
one point of origin yet they display distant relationships to ancestral species on mainlands
Molecular Biology
Like anatomical structures the molecular structures of life reflect descent with modification DNAs universality
reflects evidence of a common ancestor for all of life Fundamental divisions in life between the genetic code
DNA replication and expression are reflected in major structural differences in otherwise conservative structures
such as ribosome components and membrane structures In general the relatedness of groups of organisms is
reflected in the similarity of their DNA sequencesexactly the pattern that we would expect from descent and
diversification from a common ancestor
DNA sequences have also shed light on some of the mechanisms of evolution For example it is clear that the
evolution of new functions for proteins commonly occurs after gene duplication events that allow freely modifying
one copy by mutation selection or drift changes in a populations gene pool resulting from chance while the
second copy continues to produce a functional protein
