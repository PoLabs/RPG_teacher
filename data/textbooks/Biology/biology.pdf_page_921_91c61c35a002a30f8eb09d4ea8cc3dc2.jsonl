Phloem tissue is composed of sievetube cells companion cells phloem parenchyma and phloem fibers
A series of sievetube cells also called sievetube elements are arranged end to end to make up a long
sieve tube which transports organic substances such as sugars and amino acids The sugars flow from one
sievetube cell to the next through perforated sieve plates which are found at the end junctions between
two cells Although still alive at maturity the nucleus and other cell components of the sievetube cells have
disintegrated Companion cells are found alongside the sievetube cells providing them with metabolic support
The companion cells contain more ribosomes and mitochondria than the sievetube cells which lack some
cellular organelles
Ground Tissue
Ground tissue is mostly made up of parenchyma cells but may also contain collenchyma and sclerenchyma
cells that help support the stem The ground tissue towards the interior of the vascular tissue in a stem or root is
known as pith while the layer of tissue between the vascular tissue and the epidermis is known as the cortex
Growth in Stems
Growth in plants occurs as the stems and roots lengthen Some plants especially those that are woody also
increase in thickness during their life span The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to
as primary growth and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem Secondary growth is
characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant and is caused by cell division in the lateral
meristem Figure 3010 shows the areas of primary and secondary growth in a plant Herbaceous plants mostly
undergo primary growth with hardly any secondary growth or increase in thickness Secondary growth or wood
is noticeable in woody plants it occurs in some dicots but occurs very rarely in monocots
Figure 3010 In woody plants primary growth is followed by secondary growth which allows the plant stem to increase
in thickness or girth Secondary vascular tissue is added as the plant grows as well as a cork layer The bark of a tree
extends from the vascular cambium to the epidermis
Some plant parts such as stems and roots continue to grow throughout a plants life a phenomenon called
indeterminate growth Other plant parts such as leaves and flowers exhibit determinate growth which ceases
when a plant part reaches a particular size
Primary Growth
Most primary growth occurs at the apices or tips of stems and roots Primary growth is a result of rapidly dividing
cells in the apical meristems at the shoot tip and root tip Subsequent cell elongation also contributes to primary
growth The growth of shoots and roots during primary growth enables plants to continuously seek water roots
or sunlight shoots
The influence of the apical bud on overall plant growth is known as apical dominance which diminishes the
