water After the sperm reaches the egg fertilization takes place Most external fertilization happens during the
process of spawning where one or several females release their eggs and the males release sperm in the
same area at the same time The release of the reproductive material may be triggered by water temperature
or the length of daylight Nearly all fish spawn as do crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp mollusks such
as oysters squid and echinoderms such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers Figure 436 shows salmon
spawning in a shallow stream Frogs like those shown in Figure 437 corals molluscs and sea cucumbers also
spawn

Pairs of fish that are not broadcast spawners may exhibit courtship behavior This allows the female to select a
particular male The trigger for egg and sperm release spawning causes the egg and sperm to be placed in a
small area enhancing the possibility of fertilization
External fertilization in an aquatic environment protects the eggs from drying out Broadcast spawning can result
in a greater mixture of the genes within a group leading to higher genetic diversity and a greater chance of
species survival in a hostile environment For sessile aquatic organisms like sponges broadcast spawning is
the only mechanism for fertilization and colonization of new environments The presence of the fertilized eggs
and developing young in the water provides opportunities for predation resulting in a loss of offspring Therefore
millions of eggs must be produced by individuals and the offspring produced through this method must mature
rapidly The survival rate of eggs produced through broadcast spawning is low
