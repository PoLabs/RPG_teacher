Unfortunately there is no cure for Alzheimers disease Current treatments focus on managing the symptoms
of the disease Because decrease in the activity of cholinergic neurons neurons that use the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine is common in Alzheimers disease several drugs used to treat the disease work by increasing
acetylcholine neurotransmission often by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic
cleft Other clinical interventions focus on behavioral therapies like psychotherapy sensory therapy and
cognitive exercises Since Alzheimers disease appears to hijack the normal aging process research into
prevention is prevalent Smoking obesity and cardiovascular problems may be risk factors for the disease so
treatments for those may also help to prevent Alzheimers disease Some studies have shown that people who
remain intellectually active by playing games reading playing musical instruments and being socially active in
later life have a reduced risk of developing the disease

Parkinsons Disease
Like Alzheimers disease Parkinsons disease is a neurodegenerative disease It was first characterized by
James Parkinson in 1817 Each year 5000060000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease
Parkinsons disease causes the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra a midbrain structure that
regulates movement Loss of these neurons causes many symptoms including tremor shaking of fingers or a
limb slowed movement speech changes balance and posture problems and rigid muscles The combination
of these symptoms often causes a characteristic slow hunched shuffling walk illustrated in Figure 3531
Patients with Parkinsons disease can also exhibit psychological symptoms such as dementia or emotional
problems
Although some patients have a form of the disease known to be caused by a single mutation for most
patients the exact causes of Parkinsons disease remain unknown the disease likely results from a combination
of genetic and environmental factors similar to Alzheimers disease Postmortem analysis of brains from
Parkinsons patients shows the presence of Lewy bodiesabnormal protein clumpsin dopaminergic neurons
The prevalence of these Lewy bodies often correlates with the severity of the disease
There is no cure for Parkinsons disease and treatment is focused on easing symptoms One of the most
commonly prescribed drugs for Parkinsons is LDOPA which is a chemical that is converted into dopamine by
neurons in the brain This conversion increases the overall level of dopamine neurotransmission and can help
compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra Other drugs work by inhibiting the
enzyme that breaks down dopamine
