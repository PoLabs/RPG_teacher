cilia small hairlike projections that line the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles Figure 3911 These cilia beat
in unison and move mucus and particles out of the bronchi and bronchioles back up to the throat where it is
swallowed and eliminated via the esophagus
In humans for example tar and other substances in cigarette smoke destroy or paralyze the cilia making the
removal of particles more difficult In addition smoking causes the lungs to produce more mucus which the
damaged cilia are not able to move This causes a persistent cough as the lungs try to rid themselves of
particulate matter and makes smokers more susceptible to respiratory ailments

392  Gas Exchange across Respiratory Surfaces
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Name and describe lung volumes and capacities

Understand how gas pressure influences how gases move into and out of the body
The structure of the lung maximizes its surface area to increase gas diffusion Because of the enormous number
of alveoli approximately 300 million in each human lung the surface area of the lung is very large 75 m2
Having such a large surface area increases the amount of gas that can diffuse into and out of the lungs
Basic Principles of Gas Exchange
Gas exchange during respiration occurs primarily through diffusion Diffusion is a process in which transport is
driven by a concentration gradient Gas molecules move from a region of high concentration to a region of low
concentration Blood that is low in oxygen concentration and high in carbon dioxide concentration undergoes
gas exchange with air in the lungs The air in the lungs has a higher concentration of oxygen than that of oxygen
depleted blood and a lower concentration of carbon dioxide This concentration gradient allows for gas exchange
during respiration
Partial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases The total
pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture The rate
of diffusion of a gas is proportional to its partial pressure within the total gas mixture This concept is discussed
further in detail below
Lung Volumes and Capacities
Different animals have different lung capacities based on their activities Cheetahs have evolved a much higher
lung capacity than humans it helps provide oxygen to all the muscles in the body and allows them to run very
fast Elephants also have a high lung capacity In this case it is not because they run fast but because they have
