expression appear to be more closely related to those found in the Archaea Much remains to be clarified about
how this relationship occurred this continues to be an exciting field of discovery in biology For instance it is
not known whether the endosymbiotic event that led to mitochondria occurred before or after the host cell had a
nucleus Such organisms would be among the extinct precursors of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes
Mitochondria
One of the major features distinguishing prokaryotes from eukaryotes is the presence of mitochondria or their
reduced derivatives in virtually all eukaryotic cells Eukaryotic cells may contain anywhere from one to several
thousand mitochondria depending on the cells level of energy consumption in humans being most abundant in
the liver and skeletal muscles Each mitochondrion measures 1 to 10 or greater micrometers in length and exists
in the cell as an organelle that can be ovoid to wormshaped to intricately branched Figure 232 However
although they may have originated as freeliving aerobic organisms mitochondria can no longer survive and
reproduce outside the cell
Mitochondria have several features that suggest their relationship to alphaproteobacteria Figure 235 Alpha
proteobacteria are a large group of bacteria that includes species symbiotic with plants disease organisms
that can infect humans via ticks and many freeliving species that use light for energy Mitochondria have their
own genomes with a circular chromosome stabilized by attachments to the inner membrane Mitochondria also
have special ribosomes and transfer RNAs that resemble these same components in prokaryotes An intriguing
feature of mitochondria is that many of them exhibit minor differences from the universal genetic code However
many of the genes for respiratory proteins are now relocated in the nucleus When these genes are compared
to those of other organisms they appear to be of alphaproteobacterial origin In some eukaryotic groups
such genes are found in the mitochondria whereas in other groups they are found in the nucleus This has
been interpreted as evidence that over evolutionary time genes have been transferred from the endosymbiont
chromosome to those of the host genome This apparent loss of genes by the endosymbiont is probably one
explanation why mitochondria cannot live without a host
Another line of evidence supporting the idea that mitochondria were derived by endosymbiosis comes from the
structure of the mitochondrian itself Most mitochondria are shaped like alphaproteobacteria and are surrounded
by two membranes the inner membrane is bacterial in nature whereas the outer membrane is eukaryotic in
nature This is exactly what one would expect if one membranebound organism was engulfed into a vacuole by
another membranebound organism The outer mitochondrial membrane was derived by the enclosing vesicle
while the inner membrane was derived from the plasma membrane of the endosymbiont The mitochondrial
inner membrane is extensive and involves substantial infoldings called cristae that resemble the textured
outer surface of alphaproteobacteria The matrix and inner membrane are rich with the enzymes necessary for
aerobic respiration
Figure 232 Mitochondria In this transmission electron micrograph of mitochondria in a mammalian lung cell the
cristae infoldings of the mitochondrial inner membrane can be seen in crosssection credit Louise Howard
The third line of evidence comes from the production of new mitochondria Mitochondria divide independently
by a process that resembles binary fission in prokaryotes Mitochondria arise only from previous mitochondria
they are not formed from scratch de novo by the eukaryotic cell Mitochondria may fuse together and they may
be moved around inside the cell by interactions with the cytoskeleton They reproduce within their enclosing cell
and are distributed with the cytoplasm when a cell divides or two cells fuse Therefore although these organelles
are highly integrated into the eukaryotic cell they still reproduce as if they were independent organisms within
