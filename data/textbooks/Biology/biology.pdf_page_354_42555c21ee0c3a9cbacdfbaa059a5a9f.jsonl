recessive disorders exist typically they are associated with infertility in males and are therefore not transmitted
to subsequent generations
Figure 1213 The son of a woman who is a carrier of a recessive Xlinked disorder will have a 50 percent chance of
being affected A daughter will not be affected but she will have a 50 percent chance of being a carrier like her mother

Lethality
A large proportion of genes in an individuals genome are essential for survival Occasionally a nonfunctional
allele for an essential gene can arise by mutation and be transmitted in a population as long as individuals
with this allele also have a wildtype functional copy The wildtype allele functions at a capacity sufficient to
sustain life and is therefore considered to be dominant over the nonfunctional allele However consider two
heterozygous parents that have a genotype of wildtypenonfunctional mutant for a hypothetical essential gene
In one quarter of their offspring we would expect to observe individuals that are homozygous recessive for the
nonfunctional allele Because the gene is essential these individuals might fail to develop past fertilization die
in utero or die later in life depending on what life stage requires this gene An inheritance pattern in which an
allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal or have some altered
nonlethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal
For crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when
homozygous only wildtype homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed The genotypic ratio would
therefore be 21 In other instances the recessive lethal allele might also exhibit a dominant but not lethal
phenotype in the heterozygote For instance the recessive lethal Curly allele in Drosophila affects wing shape
in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote
