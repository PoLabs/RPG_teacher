or physical traits or both Nodes and branches comprise a phylogenetic tree The internal nodes represent
ancestors and are points in evolution when based on scientific evidence researchers believe an ancestor has
diverged to form two new species The length of each branch is proportional to the time elapsed since the split

ribosomal RNA genes The tree shows the separation of living organisms into three domains Bacteria Archaea and
