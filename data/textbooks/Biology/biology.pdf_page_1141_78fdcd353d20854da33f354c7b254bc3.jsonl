Wave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity or brightness The standard unit of intensity of light is the
candela which is approximately the luminous intensity of one common candle
Light waves travel 299792 km per second in a vacuum and somewhat slower in various media such as air
and water and those waves arrive at the eye as long red medium green and short blue waves What is
termed white light is light that is perceived as white by the human eye This effect is produced by light that
stimulates equally the color receptors in the human eye The apparent color of an object is the color or colors
that the object reflects Thus a red object reflects the red wavelengths in mixed white light and absorbs all other
wavelengths of light
Anatomy of the Eye
The photoreceptive cells of the eye where transduction of light to nervous impulses occurs are located in the
retina shown in Figure 3618 on the inner surface of the back of the eye But light does not impinge on
the retina unaltered It passes through other layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina
Figure 3618b The cornea the front transparent layer of the eye and the crystalline lens a transparent
convex structure behind the cornea both refract bend light to focus the image on the retina The iris which is
conspicuous as the colored part of the eye is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that
regulates the amount of light entering the eye In conditions of high ambient light the iris contracts reducing the
size of the pupil at its center In conditions of low light the iris relaxes and the pupil enlarges
