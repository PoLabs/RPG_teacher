movement of a bone as it rotates around its own longitudinal axis
joint with concave and convex portions that fit together named because the ends of each bone
resemble a saddle
plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber
functional unit of skeletal muscle
flat triangular bone located at the posterior pectoral girdle
small flat bone shaped like a sesame seed develops inside tendons
bone that has the same width and length giving it a cubelike shape
forms skeletal muscles which attach to bones and control locomotion and any
movement that can be consciously controlled
bone that supports the structures of the face and protects the brain
occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines stomach and urinary
bladder and around passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels
forms the inner layer of all bones
also breastbone long flat bone located at the front of the chest
movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward
small flat irregularly shaped bone that forms between the flat bones of the cranium
short fiber of connective tissue that holds the skull bones tightly in place found only in the skull
hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection between bones occurs through
fibrocartilage symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae
joint that is immovable
bones joined by hyaline cartilage synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing
bones in children
joint in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue allowing for more
movement than in a suture
only joint that has a space between the adjoining bones
one of the seven bones of the ankle
a group of myosin molecules
two polymers of actin wound together along with tropomyosin and troponin
also ribcage skeleton of the chest which consists of the ribs thoracic vertebrae sternum and
costal cartilages
also shinbone large bone of the leg that is located directly below the knee
lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates
acts to block myosin binding sites on actin molecules preventing crossbridge formation and
preventing contraction until a muscle receives a neuron signal
binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule and also binds calcium ions
