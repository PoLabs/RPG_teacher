the tetranucleotide hypothesis which stated that
DNA was composed of GACT nucleotide repeats
was the most widely accepted view of DNAs
composition How did Chargaff disprove this
hypothesis
24 Provide a brief summary of the Sanger
sequencing method
25 Describe the structure and complementary base
pairing of DNA
26 Prokaryotes have a single circular chromosome
while eukaryotes have linear chromosomes Describe
one advantage and one disadvantage to the
eukaryotic genome packaging compared to the
prokaryotes
27 How did the scientific community learn that DNA
replication takes place in a semiconservative
fashion
28 Imagine the Meselson and Stahl experiments had
supported conservative replication instead of semi
conservative replication What results would you
predict to observe after two rounds of replication Be
specific regarding percent distributions of DNA
incorporating 15N and 14N in the gradient
29 DNA replication is bidirectional and
discontinuous explain your understanding of those
concepts
30 What are Okazaki fragments and how they are
formed
31 If the rate of replication in a particular prokaryote
is 900 nucleotides per second how long would it take
12 million base pair genomes to make two copies
32 Explain the events taking place at the replication
fork If the gene for helicase is mutated what part of
replication will be affected
33 What is the role of a primer in DNA replication
What would happen if you forgot to add a primer in a
tube containing the reaction mix for a DNA
sequencing reaction
34 Quinolone antibiotics treat bacterial infections by
blocking the activity of topoisomerase Why does this
treatment work Explain what occurs at the
molecular level
35 How do the linear chromosomes in eukaryotes
ensure that its ends are replicated completely
36 What is the consequence of mutation of a
mismatch repair enzyme How will this affect the
function of a gene
37 An adult with a history of tanning has his genome
sequenced The beginning of a proteincoding region
of his DNA reads ATGGGGATATGGCAT If the
proteincoding region of a healthy adult reads
ATGGGGATATGAGCAT identify the site and type of
mutation
