CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
21 Why are biological macromolecules considered
organic
22 What role do electrons play in dehydration
synthesis and hydrolysis
23 Amino acids have the generic structure seen
below where R represents different carbonbased
side chains
Describe how the structure of amino acids allows
them to be linked into long peptide chains to form
proteins
24 Describe the similarities and differences between
glycogen and starch
25 Why is it impossible for humans to digest food
that contains cellulose
26 Draw the ketose and aldose forms of a
monosaccharide with the chemical formula C3H6O3
How is the structure of the monosaccharide changed
from one form to the other in the human body
27 Explain at least three functions that lipids serve in
plants andor animals
28 Why have trans fats been banned from some
restaurants How are they created
29 Why are fatty acids better than glycogen for
storing large amounts of chemical energy
30 Part of cortisols role in the body involves passing
through the plasma membrane to initiate signaling
inside a cell Describe how the structures of cortisol
and the plasma membrane allow this to occur
31 Explain what happens if even one amino acid is
substituted for another in a polypeptide chain
Provide a specific example
32 Describe the differences in the four protein
structures
33 Aquaporins are proteins embedded in the plasma
membrane that allow water molecules to move
