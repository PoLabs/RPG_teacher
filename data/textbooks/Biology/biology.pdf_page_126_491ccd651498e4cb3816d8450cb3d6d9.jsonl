in the cytoplasm Glucose and other simple sugars polysaccharides amino acids nucleic acids fatty acids
and derivatives of glycerol are also there Ions of sodium potassium calcium and many other elements also
dissolve in the cytoplasm Many metabolic reactions including protein synthesis take place in the cytoplasm
The Nucleus
Typically the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell Figure 48 The nucleus plural  nuclei houses
the cells DNA and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins Lets look at it in more detail Figure 411
Figure 411 The nucleus stores chromatin DNA plus proteins in a gellike substance called the nucleoplasm The
nucleolus is a condensed chromatin region where ribosome synthesis occurs We call the nucleus boundary the
nuclear envelope It consists of two phospholipid bilayers an outer and an inner membrane The nuclear membrane is
continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum Nuclear pores allow substances to enter and exit the nucleus
The Nuclear Envelope
The nuclear envelope is a doublemembrane structure that constitutes the nucleus outermost portion Figure
411 Both the nuclear envelopes inner and outer membranes are phospholipid bilayers
The nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions molecules and RNA between
the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm The nucleoplasm is the semisolid fluid inside the nucleus where we find the
chromatin and the nucleolus
Chromatin and Chromosomes
To understand chromatin it is helpful to first explore chromosomes structures within the nucleus that are made
up of DNA the hereditary material You may remember that in prokaryotes DNA is organized into a single
circular chromosome In eukaryotes chromosomes are linear structures Every eukaryotic species has a specific
number of chromosomes in the nucleus of each cell For example in humans the chromosome number is 46
while in fruit flies it is eight Chromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the
cell is getting ready to divide When the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle proteins
attach to chromosomes and they resemble an unwound jumbled bunch of threads We call these unwound
proteinchromosome complexes chromatin Figure 412 Chromatin describes the material that makes up the
chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed
