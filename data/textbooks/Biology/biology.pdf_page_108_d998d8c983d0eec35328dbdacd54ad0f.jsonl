linkage A simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules does not
form the phosphodiester linkage Its formation involves removing two phosphate groups A polynucleotide may
have thousands of such phosphodiester linkages
DNA DoubleHelix Structure
DNA has a doublehelix structure Figure 332 The sugar and phosphate lie on the outside of the helix forming
the DNAs backbone The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior like a pair of staircase steps Hydrogen
bonds bind the pairs to each other Every base pair in the double helix is separated from the next base pair by
034 nm The helixs two strands run in opposite directions meaning that the 5 carbon end of one strand will
face the 3 carbon end of its matching strand Scientists call this an antiparallel orientation and is important to
DNA replication and in many nucleic acid interactions
Figure 332 Native DNA is an antiparallel double helix The phosphate backbone indicated by the curvy lines is on
the outside and the bases are on the inside Each base from one strand interacts via hydrogen bonding with a base
from the opposing strand credit Jerome WalkerDennis Myts
Only certain types of base pairing are allowed For example a certain purine can only pair with a certain
pyrimidine This means A can pair with T and G can pair with C as Figure 333 shows This is the base
complementary rule In other words the DNA strands are complementary to each other If the sequence of
one strand is AATTGGCC the complementary strand would have the sequence TTAACCGG During DNA
replication each strand copies itself resulting in a daughter DNA double helix containing one parental DNA
strand and a newly synthesized strand
