CHAPTER SUMMARY
351 Neurons and Glial Cells
The nervous system is made up of neurons and glia Neurons are specialized cells that are capable of sending
electrical as well as chemical signals Most neurons contain dendrites which receive these signals and axons
that send signals to other neurons or tissues There are four main types of neurons unipolar bipolar
multipolar and pseudounipolar neurons Glia are nonneuronal cells in the nervous system that support
neuronal development and signaling There are several types of glia that serve different functions
352 How Neurons Communicate
Neurons have charged membranes because there are different concentrations of ions inside and outside of the
cell Voltagegated ion channels control the movement of ions into and out of a neuron When a neuronal
membrane is depolarized to at least the threshold of excitation an action potential is fired The action potential
is then propagated along a myelinated axon to the axon terminals In a chemical synapse the action potential
