CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
27 What type of meristem is found only in monocots
such as lawn grasses Explain how this type of
meristematic tissue is beneficial in lawn grasses that
are mowed each week
28 Which plant part is responsible for transporting
water minerals and sugars to different parts of the
plant Name the two types of tissue that make up
this overall tissue and explain the role of each
29 Describe the roles played by stomata and guard
cells What would happen to a plant if these cells did
not function correctly
30 Compare the structure and function of xylem to
that of phloem
31 Explain the role of the cork cambium in woody
plants
32 What is the function of lenticels
33 Besides the age of a tree what additional
information can annual rings reveal
34 Give two examples of modified stems and explain
how each example benefits the plant
35 Compare a tap root system with a fibrous root
system For each type name a plant that provides a
food in the human diet Which type of root system is
found in monocots Which type of root system is
found in dicots
36 What might happen to a root if the pericycle
disappeared
37 How do dicots differ from monocots in terms of
leaf structure
38 Describe an example of a plant with leaves that
are adapted to cold temperatures
39 The process of bulk flow transports fluids in a
plant Describe the two main bulk flow processes
40 Owners and managers of plant nurseries have to
plan lighting schedules for a longday plant that will
flower in February What lighting periods will be most
effective What color of light should be chosen
41 What are the major benefits of gravitropism for a
germinating seedling
42 Fruit and vegetable storage facilities are usually
refrigerated and well ventilated Why are these
conditions advantageous
43 Stomata close in response to bacterial infection
Why is this response a mechanism of defense for the
plant Which hormone is most likely to mediate this
response
