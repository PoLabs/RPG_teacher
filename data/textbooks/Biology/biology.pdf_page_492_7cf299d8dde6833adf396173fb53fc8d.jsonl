a useful product or enhance an existing product such as making a droughtsensitive crop more tolerant of the

Explain systems biology

Describe a proteome

Define protein signature
Proteins are the final products of genes which help perform the function that the gene encodes Amino acids
comprise proteins and play important roles in the cell All enzymes except ribozymes are proteins that act
as catalysts to affect the rate of reactions Proteins are also regulatory molecules and some are hormones
Transport proteins such as hemoglobin help transport oxygen to various organs Antibodies that defend against
foreign particles are also proteins In the diseased state protein function can be impaired because of changes
at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a specific protein
A proteome is the entire set of proteins that a cell type produces We can study proteoms using the knowledge
of genomes because genes code for mRNAs and the mRNAs encode proteins Although mRNA analysis is a
step in the right direction not all mRNAs are translated into proteins Proteomics is the study of proteomes
function Proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that they
based on genes Even though all multicellular organisms cells have the same set of genes the set of proteins
produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression Thus the genome is constant but
the proteome varies and is dynamic within an organism In addition RNAs can be alternately spliced cut and
pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins and many proteins modify themselves after translation
by processes such as proteolytic cleavage phosphorylation glycosylation and ubiquitination There are also
proteinprotein interactions which complicate studying proteomes Although the genome provides a blueprint
the final architecture depends on several factors that can change the progression of events that generate the
proteome
Metabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics Metabolomics involves studying small molecule
metabolites in an organism The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to an
organisms genetic makeup Metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical
characteristics as well as genetic makeup and environmental factors The goal of metabolome research is to
identify quantify and catalogue all the metabolites in living organisms tissues and fluids
Basic Techniques in Protein Analysis
The ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under
specific conditions study the interactions between the proteins and use the information to predict cell behavior
or develop drug targets Just as scientists analyze the genome using the basic DNA sequencing technique
proteomics requires techniques for protein analysis The basic technique for protein analysis analogous to DNA
sequencing is mass spectrometry Mass spectrometry identifies and determines a molecules characteristics
Advances in spectrometry have allowed researchers to analyze very small protein samples Xray
crystallography for example enables scientists to determine a protein crystals threedimensional structure
at atomic resolution Another protein imaging technique nuclear magnetic resonance NMR uses atoms
magnetic properties to determine the proteins threedimensional structure in aqueous solution Scientists have
also used protein microarrays to study protein interactions Largescale adaptations of the basic twohybrid
screen Figure 1717 have provided the basis for protein microarrays Scientists use computer software to
analyze the vast amount of data for proteomic analysis
Genomic and proteomicscale analyses are part of systems biology which is the study of whole biological
systems genomes and proteomes based on interactions within the system The European Bioinformatics
Institute and the Human Proteome Organization HUPO are developing and establishing effective tools to sort
through the enormous pile of systems biology data Because proteins are the direct products of genes and
reflect activity at the genomic level it is natural to use proteomes to compare the protein profiles of different cells
to identify proteins and genes involved in disease processes Most pharmaceutical drug trials target proteins
