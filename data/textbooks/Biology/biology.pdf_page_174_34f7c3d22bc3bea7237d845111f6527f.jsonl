is enclosed within the cell the clathrin disengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome
for breaking down the material in the newly formed compartment endosome When accessible nutrients from
the vesicular contents degradation have been extracted the newly formed endosome merges with the plasma
membrane and releases its contents into the extracellular fluid The endosomal membrane again becomes part
of the plasma membrane
Pinocytosis
A variation of endocytosis is pinocytosis This literally means cell drinking Discovered by Warren Lewis in
1929 this American embryologist and cell biologist described a process whereby he assumed that the cell was
purposefully taking in extracellular fluid In reality this is a process that takes in molecules including water which
the cell needs from the extracellular fluid Pinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than does phagocytosis
and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome Figure 521

A variation of pinocytosis is potocytosis This process uses a coating protein caveolin on the plasma
membranes cytoplasmic side which performs a similar function to clathrin The cavities in the plasma
membrane that form the vacuoles have membrane receptors and lipid rafts in addition to caveolin The vacuoles
or vesicles formed in caveolae singular caveola are smaller than those in pinocytosis Potocytosis brings small
molecules into the cell and transports them through the cell for their release on the other side a process we call
transcytosis
Receptormediated Endocytosis
A targeted variation of endocytosis employs receptor proteins in the plasma membrane that have a specific
binding affinity for certain substances Figure 522
