tumor suppressor gene
organisms have pairs of homologous chromosomes homologs with each homolog derived from a
different parent
period of the cell cycle leading up to mitosis includes G1 S and G2 phases the interim period
between two consecutive cell divisions
mitotic nuclear division
protein structure associated with the centromere of each sister chromatid that attracts and binds
spindle microtubules during prometaphase
position of a gene on a chromosome
stage of mitosis during which chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate
equatorial plane midway between the two poles of a cell where the chromosomes align during
metaphase
also karyokinesis period of the cell cycle during which the duplicated chromosomes are separated
into identical nuclei includes prophase prometaphase metaphase anaphase and telophase
period of the cell cycle during which duplicated chromosomes are distributed into two nuclei and
cytoplasmic contents are divided includes karyokinesis mitosis and cytokinesis
apparatus composed of microtubules that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during
mitosis
subunit of chromatin composed of a short length of DNA wrapped around a core of histone
proteins
mutated version of a normal gene involved in the positive regulation of the cell cycle
also ORI region of the prokaryotic chromosome where replication begins origin of replication
cellcycle regulatory protein that inhibits the cell cycle its levels are controlled by p53
cellcycle regulatory protein that regulates cell growth and monitors DNA damage it halts the progression
of the cell cycle in cases of DNA damage and may induce apoptosis
stage of mitosis during which the nuclear membrane breaks down and mitotic spindle fibers
attach to kinetochores
stage of mitosis during which chromosomes condense and the mitotic spindle begins to form
normal gene that when mutated becomes an oncogene
refers to a cell that is performing normal cell functions and has not initiated preparations for cell
division
regulatory molecule that exhibits negative effects on the cell cycle by interacting
with a transcription factor E2F
second or synthesis stage of interphase during which DNA replication occurs
structure formed in a bacterial cell as a precursor to the separation of the cell into two daughter cells
stage of mitosis during which chromosomes arrive at opposite poles decondense and are
surrounded by a new nuclear envelope
segment of DNA that codes for regulator proteins that prevent the cell from
undergoing uncontrolled division
