Figure 1814 Aneuploidy results when the gametes have too many or too few chromosomes due to nondisjunction
during meiosis In this example the resulting offspring will have 2n1 or 2n1 chromosomes
Which is most likely to survive offspring with 2n1 chromosomes or offspring with 2n1 chromosomes
Polyploidy is a condition in which a cell or organism has an extra set or sets of chromosomes Scientists have
identified two main types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploidy
state Reproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed In some cases a polyploid individual will have two or
more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition that we call autopolyploidy Figure
1815 The prefix auto means self so the term means multiple chromosomes from ones own species
Polyploidy results from an error in meiosis in which all of the chromosomes move into one cell instead of
separating
Figure 1815 Autopolyploidy results when mitosis is not followed by cytokinesis
For example if a plant species with 2n  6 produces autopolyploid gametes that are also diploid 2n  6 when
they should be n  3 the gametes now have twice as many chromosomes as they should have These new
gametes will be incompatible with the normal gametes that this plant species produces However they could
either selfpollinate or reproduce with other autopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number
In this way sympatric speciation can occur quickly by forming offspring with 4n that we call a tetraploid These
individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of this new kind and not those of the ancestral
species
The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable
offspring that we call an allopolyploid The prefix allo means other recall from allopatric therefore an
allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine Figure 1816 illustrates one possible
