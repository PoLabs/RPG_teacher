keep dividing and adding to the height of the sporophyte This growth pattern is unique to the hornworts Many
hornworts establish symbiotic relationships with cyanobacteria that fix nitrogen from the environment
The lifecycle of hornworts Figure 2513 follows the general pattern of alternation of generations The
gametophytes grow as flat thalli on the soil with embedded male and female gametangia Flagellated sperm
swim to the archegonia and fertilize eggs The zygote develops into a long and slender sporophyte that
eventually splits open down the side releasing spores Thin branched cells called pseudoelaters surround the
spores and help propel them farther in the environment The haploid spores germinate and give rise to the next
generation of gametophytes

Mosses
The mosses are the most numerous of the nonvascular plants More than 10000 species of mosses have been
catalogued Their habitats vary from the tundra where they are the main vegetation to the understory of tropical
forests In the tundra the mosses shallow rhizoids allow them to fasten to a substrate without penetrating the
frozen soil Mosses slow down erosion store moisture and soil nutrients and provide shelter for small animals
as well as food for larger herbivores such as the musk ox Mosses are very sensitive to air pollution and are
used to monitor air quality They are also sensitive to copper salts so these salts are a common ingredient of
compounds marketed to eliminate mosses from lawns
Mosses form diminutive gametophytes which are the dominant phase of the lifecycle Green flat structures with
a simple midribresembling true leaves but lacking stomata and vascular tissueare attached in a spiral to a
central stalk Mosses have stomata only on the sporophyte Water and nutrients are absorbed directly through
the leaflike structures of the gametophyte Some mosses have small branches A primitive conductive system
that carries water and nutrients runs up the gametophytes stalk but does not extend into the leaves Additionally
mosses are anchored to the substratewhether it is soil rock or roof tilesby multicellular rhizoids precursors
of roots They originate from the base of the gametophyte but are not the major route for the absorption of water
and minerals The lack of a true root system explains why it is so easy to rip moss mats from a tree trunk The
mosses therefore occupy a threshold position between other bryophytes and the vascular plants
The moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in Figure 2514 The most
familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a
protonemausually a tangle of singlecelled filaments that hug the ground Cells akin to an apical meristem
actively divide and give rise to a gametophore consisting of a photosynthetic stem and foliagelike structures
