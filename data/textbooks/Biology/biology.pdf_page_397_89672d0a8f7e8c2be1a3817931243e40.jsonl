Neanderthal Genome How Are We Related
The first draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was recently published by Richard E Green et al in
2010

Neanderthals are the closest ancestors of presentday humans They were known to have lived
in Europe and Western Asia and now perhaps in Northern Africa before they disappeared from fossil
records approximately 30000 years ago Greens team studied almost 40000yearold fossil remains that
were selected from sites across the world Extremely sophisticated means of sample preparation and DNA
sequencing were employed because of the fragile nature of the bones and heavy microbial contamination
In their study the scientists were able to sequence some four billion base pairs The Neanderthal sequence
was compared with that of presentday humans from across the world After comparing the sequences the
researchers found that the Neanderthal genome had 2 to 3 percent greater similarity to people living outside
Africa than to people in Africa While current theories have suggested that all presentday humans can
be traced to a small ancestral population in Africa the data from the Neanderthal genome suggest some
interbreeding between Neanderthals and early modern humans
Green and his colleagues also discovered DNA segments among people in Europe and Asia that are
more similar to Neanderthal sequences than to other contemporary human sequences Another interesting
observation was that Neanderthals are as closely related to people from Papua New Guinea as to those
from China or France This is surprising because Neanderthal fossil remains have been located only
in Europe and West Asia Most likely genetic exchange took place between Neanderthals and modern
humans as modern humans emerged out of Africa before the divergence of Europeans East Asians and
Papua New Guineans
Several genes seem to have undergone changes from Neanderthals during the evolution of present
day humans These genes are involved in cranial structure metabolism skin morphology and cognitive
development One of the genes that is of particular interest is RUNX2 which is different in modern day
humans and Neanderthals This gene is responsible for the prominent frontal bone bellshaped rib cage
and dental differences seen in Neanderthals It is speculated that an evolutionary change in RUNX2 was
important in the origin of modernday humans and this affected the cranium and the upper body
