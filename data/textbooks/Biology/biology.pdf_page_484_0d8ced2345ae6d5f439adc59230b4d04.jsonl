Because genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of recombination natural increases or decreases
in the recombination level given genome area affects mapping Some parts of the genome are recombination
hotspots whereas others do not show a propensity for recombination For this reason it is important to look at
mapping information developed by multiple methods
Physical Maps
A physical map provides detail of the actual physical distance between genetic markers as well as the number
of nucleotides There are three methods scientists use to create a physical map cytogenetic mapping radiation
hybrid mapping and sequence mapping Cytogenetic mapping uses information from microscopic analysis
of stained chromosome sections Figure 1712 It is possible to determine the approximate distance between
genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping but not the exact distance number of base pairs Radiation
hybrid mapping uses radiation such as xrays to break the DNA into fragments We can adjust the radiation
amount to create smaller or larger fragments This technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping
and we can adjust the radiation so that increased or decreased recombination frequency does not affect it
Sequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for creating detailed physical maps
with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs Creating genomic libraries and complementary
DNA cDNA libraries collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome has sped the physical
mapping process A genetic site that scientists use to generate a physical map with sequencing technology a
sequencetagged site or STS is a unique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location
An expressed sequence tag EST and a single sequence length polymorphism SSLP are common STSs An
EST is a short STS that we can identify with cDNA libraries while we obtain SSLPs from known genetic markers
which provide a link between genetic and physical maps
