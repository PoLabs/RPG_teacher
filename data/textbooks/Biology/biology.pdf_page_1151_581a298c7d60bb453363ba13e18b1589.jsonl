362 Somatosensation
Somatosensation includes all sensation received from the skin and mucous membranes as well as from the
limbs and joints Somatosensation occurs all over the exterior of the body and at some interior locations as
well and a variety of receptor types embedded in the skin and mucous membranes play a role
There are several types of specialized sensory receptors Rapidly adapting free nerve endings detect
nociception hot and cold and light touch Slowly adapting encapsulated Merkels disks are found in fingertips
and lips and respond to light touch Meissners corpuscles found in glabrous skin are rapidly adapting
encapsulated receptors that detect touch lowfrequency vibration and flutter Ruffini endings are slowly
adapting encapsulated receptors that detect skin stretch joint activity and warmth Hair receptors are rapidly
adapting nerve endings wrapped around the base of hair follicles that detect hair movement and skin
deflection Finally Pacinian corpuscles are encapsulated rapidly adapting receptors that detect transient
pressure and highfrequency vibration
363 Taste and Smell
There are five primary tastes in humans sweet sour bitter salty and umami Each taste has its own receptor
type that responds only to that taste Tastants enter the body and are dissolved in saliva Taste cells are located
within taste buds which are found on three of the four types of papillae in the mouth
Regarding olfaction there are many thousands of odorants but humans detect only about 10000 Like taste
receptors olfactory receptors are each responsive to only one odorant Odorants dissolve in nasal mucosa
where they excite their corresponding olfactory sensory cells When these cells detect an odorant they send
their signals to the main olfactory bulb and then to other locations in the brain including the olfactory cortex
364 Hearing and Vestibular Sensation
Audition is important for territory defense predation predator defense and communal exchanges The
vestibular system which is not auditory detects linear acceleration and angular acceleration and deceleration
Both the auditory system and vestibular system use hair cells as their receptors
Auditory stimuli are sound waves The sound wave energy reaches the outer ear pinna canal tympanum
and vibrations of the tympanum send the energy to the middle ear The middle ear bones shift and the stapes
transfers mechanical energy to the oval window of the fluidfilled inner ear cochlea Once in the cochlea the
energy causes the basilar membrane to flex thereby bending the stereocilia on receptor hair cells This
activates the receptors which send their auditory neural signals to the brain
The vestibular system has five parts that work together to provide the sense of direction thus helping to
maintain balance The utricle and saccule measure head orientation their calcium carbonate crystals shift
when the head is tilted thereby activating hair cells The semicircular canals work similarly such that when the
head is turned the fluid in the canals bends stereocilia on hair cells The vestibular hair cells also send signals
to the thalamus and to the somatosensory cortex but also to the cerebellum the structure above the brainstem
that plays a large role in timing and coordination of movement
365 Vision
Vision is the only photo responsive sense Visible light travels in waves and is a very small slice of the
electromagnetic radiation spectrum Light waves differ based on their frequency wavelength  hue and
amplitude intensity  brightness
In the vertebrate retina there are two types of light receptors photoreceptors cones and rods Cones which
are the source of color vision exist in three formsL M and Sand they are differentially sensitive to different
wavelengths Cones are located in the retina along with the dimlight achromatic receptors rods Cones are
found in the fovea the central region of the retina whereas rods are found in the peripheral regions of the
retina
Visual signals travel from the eye over the axons of retinal ganglion cells which make up the optic nerves
Ganglion cells come in several versions Some ganglion cell axons carry information on form movement
depth and brightness while other axons carry information on color and fine detail Visual information is sent to
the superior colliculi in the midbrain where coordination of eye movements and integration of auditory
information takes place Visual information is also sent to the suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN of the
hypothalamus which plays a role in the circadian cycle
