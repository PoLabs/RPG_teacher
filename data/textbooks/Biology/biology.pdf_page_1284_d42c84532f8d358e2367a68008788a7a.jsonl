white blood cell
blood vessel that brings blood back to the heart
major vein of the body returning blood from the upper and lower parts of the body see the superior
vena cava and inferior vena cava
heart large inferior chamber of the heart that pumps blood into arteries
blood vessel that connects a capillary bed to a vein
large 30 m cell with nuclei of which there are many types with different roles including the
protection of the body from viruses and bacteria and cleaning up dead cells and other waste
CHAPTER SUMMARY
401 Overview of the Circulatory System
In most animals the circulatory system is used to transport blood through the body Some primitive animals use
diffusion for the exchange of water nutrients and gases However complex organisms use the circulatory
system to carry gases nutrients and waste through the body Circulatory systems may be open mixed with
the interstitial fluid or closed separated from the interstitial fluid Closed circulatory systems are a
characteristic of vertebrates however there are significant differences in the structure of the heart and the
circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptions during evolution and associated
differences in anatomy Fish have a twochambered heart with unidirectional circulation Amphibians have a
threechambered heart which has some mixing of the blood and they have double circulation Most nonavian
reptiles have a threechambered heart but have little mixing of the blood they have double circulation
Mammals and birds have a fourchambered heart with no mixing of the blood and double circulation
402 Components of the Blood
Specific components of the blood include red blood cells white blood cells platelets and the plasma which
contains coagulation factors and serum Blood is important for regulation of the bodys pH temperature
osmotic pressure the circulation of nutrients and removal of waste the distribution of hormones from endocrine
glands and the elimination of excess heat it also contains components for blood clotting Red blood cells are
specialized cells that contain hemoglobin and circulate through the body delivering oxygen to cells White blood
cells are involved in the immune response to identify and target invading bacteria viruses and other foreign
organisms they also recycle waste components such as old red blood cells Platelets and blood clotting
factors cause the change of the soluble protein fibrinogen to the insoluble protein fibrin at a wound site forming
a plug Plasma consists of 90 percent water along with various substances such as coagulation factors and
antibodies The serum is the plasma component of the blood without the coagulation factors
403 Mammalian Heart and Blood Vessels
The heart muscle pumps blood through three divisions of the circulatory system coronary pulmonary and
systemic There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left
side The pumping of the heart is a function of cardiomyocytes distinctive muscle cells that are striated like
skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle The internal pacemaker starts at
the sinoatrial node which is located near the wall of the right atrium Electrical charges pulse from the SA node
causing the two atria to contract in unison then the pulse reaches the atrioventricular node between the right
atrium and right ventricle A pause in the electric signal allows the atria to empty completely into the ventricles
before the ventricles pump out the blood The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex
network of blood vessels arteries take blood away from the heart and veins bring blood back to the heart
404 Blood Flow and Blood Pressure Regulation
Blood primarily moves through the body by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and by
the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves Blood is prevented from flowing backward in the veins by
oneway valves Blood flow through the capillary beds is controlled by precapillary sphincters to increase and
decrease flow depending on the bodys needs and is directed by nerve and hormone signals Lymph vessels
take fluid that has leaked out of the blood to the lymph nodes where it is cleaned before returning to the heart
During systole blood enters the arteries and the artery walls stretch to accommodate the extra blood During
diastole the artery walls return to normal The blood pressure of the systole phase and the diastole phase
