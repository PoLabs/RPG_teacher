meiosis there are two rounds of nuclear division resulting in four nuclei and usually four daughter cells each
with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell The first division separates homologs and the
secondlike mitosisseparates chromatids into individual chromosomes Meiosis generates variation in the
daughter nuclei during crossover in prophase I as well as during the random alignment of tetrads at metaphase
I The cells that are produced by meiosis are genetically unique
Meiosis and mitosis share similar processes but have distinct outcomes Mitotic divisions are single nuclear
divisions that produce genetically identical daughter nuclei ie each daughter nucleus has the same number
of chromosome sets as the original cell In contrast meiotic divisions include two nuclear divisions that
ultimately produce four genetically different daughter nuclei that have only one chromosome set instead of the
two sets of chromosomes in the parent cell The main differences between the two nuclear division processes
take place during the first division of meiosis homologous chromosomes pair crossover and exchange
homologous nonsister chromatid segments The homologous chromosomes separate into different nuclei
during meiosis I causing a reduction of ploidy level in the first division The second division of meiosis is similar
to a mitotic division except that the daughter cells do not contain identical genomes because of crossover and
chromosome recombination in prophase I
112 Sexual Reproduction
Nearly all eukaryotes undergo sexual reproduction The variation introduced into the reproductive cells by
meiosis provides an important advantage that has made sexual reproduction evolutionarily successful Meiosis
and fertilization alternate in sexual life cycles The process of meiosis produces unique reproductive cells called
gametes which have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell When two haploid gametes fuse this
restores the diploid condition in the new zygote Thus most sexually reproducing organisms alternate between
haploid and diploid stages However the ways in which reproductive cells are produced and the timing between
meiosis and fertilization vary greatly
