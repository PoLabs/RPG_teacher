a
The cell would secrete all its intracellular
proteins
b
The plasma membrane would increase in
size over time
c
The cell would stop expressing integral
receptor proteins in its plasma membrane
d
The cell would lyse
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
21 Why is it advantageous for the cell membrane to
be fluid in nature
22 Why do phospholipids tend to spontaneously
orient themselves into something resembling a
membrane
23 How can a cell use an extracellular peripheral
protein as the receptor to transmit a signal into the
cell
24 Discuss why the following affect the rate of
diffusion molecular size temperature solution
density and the distance that must be traveled
25 Why does water move through a membrane
26 Both of the regular intravenous solutions
administered in medicine normal saline and lactated
Ringers solution are isotonic Why is this important
27 Describe two ways that decreasing temperature
would affect the rate of diffusion of molecules across
a cells plasma membrane
28 A cell develops a mutation in its potassium
channels that prevents the ions from leaving the cell
If the cells aquaporins are still active what will
happen to the cell Be sure to describe the tonicity
and osmolarity of the cell
29 Where does the cell get energy for active
transport processes
30 How does the sodiumpotassium pump contribute
to the net negative charge of the interior of the cell
31 Glucose from digested food enters intestinal
epithelial cells by active transport Why would
intestinal cells use active transport when most body
cells use facilitated diffusion
32 The sodiumcalcium exchanger NCX transports
sodium into and calcium out of cardiac muscle cells
Describe why this transporter is classified as
secondary active transport
33 Why is it important that there are different types
of proteins in plasma membranes for the transport of
materials into and out of a cell
34 Why do ions have a difficult time getting through
plasma membranes despite their small size
