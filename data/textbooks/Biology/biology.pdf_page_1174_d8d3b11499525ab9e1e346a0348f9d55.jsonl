in turn releases hormones that regulate hormone production by other endocrine glands The anterior pituitary
releases the thyroidstimulating hormone which then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce the hormones T3
and T4 As blood concentrations of T3 and T4 rise they inhibit both the pituitary and the hypothalamus in a
negative feedback loop
Neural Stimuli
In some cases the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones which is referred
to as neural stimuli Recall that in a shortterm stress response the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine
are important for providing the bursts of energy required for the body to respond Here neuronal signaling from
the sympathetic nervous system directly stimulates the adrenal medulla to release the hormones epinephrine
and norepinephrine in response to stress
375  Endocrine Glands
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the role of different glands in the endocrine system

Explain how the different glands work together to maintain homeostasis
Both the endocrine and nervous systems use chemical signals to communicate and regulate the bodys
physiology The endocrine system releases hormones that act on target cells to regulate development growth
energy metabolism reproduction and many behaviors The nervous system releases neurotransmitters or
neurohormones that regulate neurons muscle cells and endocrine cells Because the neurons can regulate the
release of hormones the nervous and endocrine systems work in a coordinated manner to regulate the bodys
physiology
HypothalamicPituitary Axis
The hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems The hypothalamus is an
endocrine organ located in the diencephalon of the brain It receives input from the body and other brain areas
and initiates endocrine responses to environmental changes The hypothalamus acts as an endocrine organ
synthesizing hormones and transporting them along axons to the posterior pituitary gland It synthesizes and
secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland The hypothalamus
contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control
The pituitary gland sometimes called the hypophysis or master gland is located at the base of the brain in
the sella turcica a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull illustrated in Figure 3715 It is attached to the
hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk or infundibulum The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is
regulated by releasing or releaseinhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary
receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus The pituitary has
two distinct regionsthe anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitarywhich between them secrete nine different
peptide or protein hormones The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland contains axons of the hypothalamic
neurons
