CHAPTER SUMMARY
281 Phylum Porifera
Animals included in phylum Porifera are parazoans because they do not show the formation of true
embryonically derived tissues although they have a number of specific cell types and functional tissues such
as pinacoderm These organisms show very simple organization with a rudimentary endoskeleton of spicules
and spongin fibers Glass sponge cells are connected together in a multinucleated syncytium Although
sponges are very simple in organization they perform most of the physiological functions typical of more
complex animals
282 Phylum Cnidaria
Cnidarians represent a more complex level of organization than Porifera They possess outer and inner tissue
layers that sandwich a noncellular mesoglea between them Cnidarians possess a wellformed digestive
system and carry out extracellular digestion in a digestive cavity that extends through much of the animal The
mouth is surrounded by tentacles that contain large numbers of cnidocytesspecialized cells bearing
nematocysts used for stinging and capturing prey as well as discouraging predators Cnidarians have separate
sexes and many have a lifecycle that involves two distinct morphological formsmedusoid and polypoidat
various stages in their life cycles In species with both forms the medusa is the sexual gameteproducing
stage and the polyp is the asexual stage Cnidarian species include individual or colonial polypoid forms
floating colonies or large individual medusa forms sea jellies
283 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa Flatworms Rotifers and Nemerteans
This section describes three phyla of relatively simple invertebrates one acoelomate one pseudocoelomate
and one eucoelomate Flatworms are acoelomate triploblastic animals They lack circulatory and respiratory
systems and have a rudimentary excretory system This digestive system is incomplete in most species and
absent in tapeworms There are four traditional groups of flatworms the largely freeliving turbellarians which
include polycladid marine worms and tricladid freshwater species the ectoparasitic monogeneans and the
endoparasitic trematodes and cestodes Trematodes have complex life cycles involving a molluscan secondary
host and a primary host in which sexual reproduction takes place Cestodes or tapeworms infect the digestive
systems of their primary vertebrate hosts
Rotifers are microscopic multicellular mostly aquatic organisms that are currently under taxonomic revision
The group is characterized by the ciliated wheellike corona located on their head Food collected by the
corona is passed to another structure unique to this group of organismsthe mastax or jawed pharynx
The nemerteans are probably simple eucoelomates These ribbonshaped animals also bear a specialized
proboscis enclosed within a rhynchocoel The development of a closed circulatory system derived from the
coelom is a significant difference seen in this species compared to other phyla described here Alimentary
nervous and excretory systems are more developed in the nemerteans than in the flatworms or rotifers
Embryonic development of nemertean worms proceeds via a planuliform or trochophorelike larval stage
