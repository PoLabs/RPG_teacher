mother plant so they may find favorable and less competitive conditions in which to germinate and grow
Some fruit have builtin mechanisms so they can disperse by themselves whereas others require the help of
agents like wind water and animals Figure 3223 Modifications in seed structure composition and size help
in dispersal Winddispersed fruit are lightweight and may have winglike appendages that allow them to be
carried by the wind Some have a parachutelike structure to keep them afloat Some fruitsfor example the
dandelionhave hairy weightless structures that are suited to dispersal by wind
Seeds dispersed by water are contained in light and buoyant fruit giving them the ability to float Coconuts are
well known for their ability to float on water to reach land where they can germinate Similarly willow and silver
birches produce lightweight fruit that can float on water
Animals and birds eat fruits and the seeds that are not digested are excreted in their droppings some distance
away Some animals like squirrels bury seedcontaining fruits for later use if the squirrel does not find its stash
of fruit and if conditions are favorable the seeds germinate Some fruits like the cocklebur have hooks or sticky
structures that stick to an animals coat and are then transported to another place Humans also play a big role in
dispersing seeds when they carry fruits to new places and throw away the inedible part that contains the seeds
All of the above mechanisms allow for seeds to be dispersed through space much like an animals offspring can
move to a new location Seed dormancy which was described earlier allows plants to disperse their progeny
through time something animals cannot do Dormant seeds can wait months years or even decades for the
proper conditions for germination and propagation of the species

323  Asexual Reproduction
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Compare the mechanisms and methods of natural and artificial asexual reproduction

Describe the advantages and disadvantages of natural and artificial asexual reproduction

Discuss plant life spans
Many plants are able to propagate themselves using asexual reproduction This method does not require
the investment required to produce a flower attract pollinators or find a means of seed dispersal Asexual
reproduction produces plants that are genetically identical to the parent plant because no mixing of male and
female gametes takes place Traditionally these plants survive well under stable environmental conditions when
compared with plants produced from sexual reproduction because they carry genes identical to those of their
parents
Many different types of roots exhibit asexual reproduction Figure 3224 The corm is used by gladiolus and
garlic Bulbs such as a scaly bulb in lilies and a tunicate bulb in daffodils are other common examples A potato
is a stem tuber while parsnip propagates from a taproot Ginger and iris produce rhizomes while ivy uses an
adventitious root a root arising from a plant part other than the main or primary root and the strawberry plant
has a stolon which is also called a runner
