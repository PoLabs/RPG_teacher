outer cuticle called ecdysis to strip off At first this seems to be a dangerous method of growth because
while the new exoskeleton is hardening the animal is vulnerable to predation however molting and ecdysis
also allow for growth and change in morphology as well as for great diversification in size simply because the
numbers of molts can be modified through evolution
The characteristic morphology of representative animals from each subphylum is described below

and hemocoel tissue shaped like a stack of books hence the name book lung The book gills of b horseshoe
crabs are similar to book lungs but are external so that gas exchange can occur with the surrounding water credit a

Subphylum Chelicerata
This subphylum includes animals such as horseshoe crabs sea spiders spiders mites ticks scorpions whip
scorpions and harvestmen Chelicerates are predominantly terrestrial although some freshwater and marine
species also exist An estimated 77000 species of chelicerates can be found in almost all terrestrial habitats
The body of chelicerates is divided into two tagmata prosoma and opisthosoma which are basically the
equivalents of a cephalothorax usually smaller and an abdomen usually larger A distinct head tagma is
not usually discernible The phylum derives its name from the first pair of appendages the chelicerae Figure
2838 which serve as specialized clawlike or fanglike mouthparts We should note here that chelicerae are
actually modified legs but they are not the exact serial equivalent of mandibles which are the modified leglike
chewing mouthparts of insects and crustaceans The chelicerae are borne on the first segment making up
the prosoma whereas the mandibles are embryonically on the fourth segment of the mandibulate head The
chelicerates have secondarily lost their antennae and hence do not have them Some of the functions of the
antennae such as touch are now performed by the second pair of appendages the pedipalps which may
also be used for general sensing the environment as well as the manipulation of food In some species such
as sea spiders an additional pair of derived leg appendages called ovigers is present between the chelicerae
and pedipalps Ovigers are used for grooming and by males to carry eggs In spiders the chelicerae are often
modified and terminate in fangs that inject venom into their prey before feeding Figure 2839
