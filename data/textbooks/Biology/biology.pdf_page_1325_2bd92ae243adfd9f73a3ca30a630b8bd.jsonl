Figure 4214 Natural killer NK cells recognize the MHC I receptor on healthy cells If MHC I is absent the cell is
lysed
Based on what you know about MHC receptors why do you think an organ transplanted from an
incompatible donor to a recipient will be rejected
Plasma cells and CTLs are collectively called effector cells they represent differentiated versions of their nave
counterparts and they are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host
cells
Mucosal Surfaces and Immune Tolerance
The innate and adaptive immune responses discussed thus far comprise the systemic immune system affecting
the whole body which is distinct from the mucosal immune system Mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa
associated lymphoid tissue which functions independently of the systemic immune system and which has
its own innate and adaptive components Mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue MALT illustrated in Figure
4215 is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the
body This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the
external environment The systemic and mucosal immune systems use many of the same cell types Foreign
particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells called M cells and delivered to
APCs located directly below the mucosal tissue M cells function in the transport described and are located in
the Peyers patch a lymphoid nodule APCs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells with
B cells and macrophages having minor roles Processed antigens displayed on APCs are detected by T cells
in the MALT and at various mucosal induction sites such as the tonsils adenoids appendix or the mesenteric
lymph nodes of the intestine Activated T cells then migrate through the lymphatic system and into the circulatory
system to mucosal sites of infection
