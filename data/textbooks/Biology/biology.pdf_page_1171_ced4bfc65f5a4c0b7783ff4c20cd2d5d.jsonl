Hormonal Regulation of Stress
When a threat or danger is perceived the body responds by releasing hormones that will ready it for the fight
orflight response The effects of this response are familiar to anyone who has been in a stressful situation

FightorFlight Response
Interactions of the endocrine hormones have evolved to ensure the bodys internal environment remains
stable Stressors are stimuli that disrupt homeostasis The sympathetic division of the vertebrate autonomic
nervous system has evolved the fightorflight response to counter stressinduced disruptions of
homeostasis In the initial alarm phase the sympathetic nervous system stimulates an increase in energy
levels through increased blood glucose levels This prepares the body for physical activity that may be
required to respond to stress to either fight for survival or to flee from danger
However some stresses such as illness or injury can last for a long time Glycogen reserves which provide
energy in the shortterm response to stress are exhausted after several hours and cannot meet longterm
energy needs If glycogen reserves were the only energy source available neural functioning could not be
maintained once the reserves became depleted due to the nervous systems high requirement for glucose
In this situation the body has evolved a response to counter longterm stress through the actions of the
glucocorticoids which ensure that longterm energy requirements can be met The glucocorticoids mobilize
lipid and protein reserves stimulate gluconeogenesis conserve glucose for use by neural tissue and
stimulate the conservation of salts and water The mechanisms to maintain homeostasis that are described
here are those observed in the human body However the fightorflight response exists in some form in all
vertebrates
The sympathetic nervous system regulates the stress response via the hypothalamus Stressful stimuli cause
the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla which mediates shortterm stress responses via nerve
impulses
and
the
adrenal
cortex
which
mediates
longterm
stress
responses
via
the
hormone
adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH which is produced by the anterior pituitary
Shortterm Stress Response
When presented with a stressful situation the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide
a burst of energy The hormones epinephrine also known as adrenaline and norepinephrine also known
as noradrenaline are released by the adrenal medulla How do these hormones provide a burst of energy
Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver and skeletal muscles to
break down glycogen and by stimulating glucose release by liver cells Additionally these hormones increase
oxygen availability to cells by increasing the heart rate and dilating the bronchioles The hormones also prioritize
body function by increasing blood supply to essential organs such as the heart brain and skeletal muscles
while restricting blood flow to organs not in immediate need such as the skin digestive system and kidneys
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are collectively called catecholamines

Longterm Stress Response
Longterm stress response differs from shortterm stress response The body cannot sustain the bursts of
energy mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine for long times Instead other hormones come into play In
