correctly a plant could not get the carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis nor could it release the oxygen produced
by photosynthesis 31 In woody plants the cork cambium is the outermost lateral meristem it produces new cells
towards the interior which enables the plant to increase in girth The cork cambium also produces cork cells towards
the exterior which protect the plant from physical damage while reducing water loss 33 Annual rings can also indicate
the climate conditions that prevailed during each growing season 35 A tap root system has a single main root that
grows down A fibrous root system forms a dense network of roots that is closer to the soil surface An example of a
tap root system is a carrot Grasses such as wheat rice and corn are examples of fibrous root systems Fibrous root
systems are found in monocots tap root systems are found in dicots 37 Monocots have leaves with parallel venation
and dicots have leaves with reticulate netlike venation 39 The process of bulk flow moves water up the xylem and
moves photosynthates solutes up and down the phloem 41 Gravitropism will allow roots to dig deep into the soil to
find water and minerals whereas the seedling will grow towards light to enable photosynthesis 43 To prevent further
entry of pathogens stomata close even if they restrict entry of CO2 Some pathogens secrete virulence factors that
inhibit the closing of stomata Abscisic acid is the stress hormone responsible for inducing closing of stomata

which are not harvested at the end of the growing season The belowground nitrogen can be used in the next season

growth and chlorosis 18 Answers may vary Essential macronutrients include carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen
phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium and sulfur Essential micronutrients include iron manganese boron
molybdenum copper zinc chlorine nickel cobalt sodium and silicon 20 Parent material climate topography
biological factors and time affect soil formation Parent material is the material in which soils form Climate describes
how temperature moisture and wind cause different patterns of weathering influencing the characteristics of the soil
Topography affects the characteristics and fertility of a soil Biological factors include the presence of living organisms
that greatly affect soil formation Processes such as freezing and thawing may produce cracks in rocks plant roots
can penetrate these crevices and produce more fragmentation Time affects soil because soil develops over long
periods 22 Because it is natural and does not require use of a nonrenewable resource such as natural gas 24 A
nodule results from the symbiosis between a plant and bacterium Within nodules the process of nitrogen fixation
allows the plant to obtain nitrogen from the air

the flower are the reproductive organs of the plant The stamen is the male reproductive organ Pollen is produced in
the stamen The carpel is the female reproductive organ The ovary is the swollen base of the carpel where ovules
are found Not all flowers have every one of the four parts 18 A typical flower has four main parts or whorls the
calyx corolla androecium and gynoecium The outermost whorl of the flower has green leafy structures known as
sepals which are collectively called the calyx It helps to protect the unopened bud The second whorl is made up
of brightly colored petals that are known collectively as the corolla The third whorl is the male reproductive structure
known as the androecium The androecium has stamens which have anthers on a stalk or filament Pollen grains are
borne on the anthers The gynoecium is the female reproductive structure The carpel is the individual structure of the
gynoecium and has a stigma the stalk or style and the ovary 20 Many seeds enter a period of inactivity or extremely
low metabolic activity a process known as dormancy Dormancy allows seeds to tide over unfavorable conditions and
germinate on return to favorable conditions Favorable conditions could be as diverse as moisture light cold fire or
chemical treatments After heavy rains many new seedlings emerge Forest fires also lead to the emergence of new
seedlings 22 Asexual reproduction does not require the expenditure of the plants resources and energy that would
be involved in producing a flower attracting pollinators or dispersing seeds Asexual reproduction results in plants that
are genetically identical to the parent plant since there is no mixing of male and female gametes resulting in better
survival The cuttings or buds taken from an adult plant produce progeny that mature faster and are sturdier than a
seedling grown from a seed 24 Plant species that complete their life cycle in one season are known as annuals
Biennials complete their life cycle in two seasons In the first season the plant has a vegetative phase whereas in
the next season it completes its reproductive phase Perennials such as the magnolia complete their life cycle in two
years or more

29 Diffusion is effective over a very short distance If a cell exceeds this distance in its size
the center of the cell cannot get adequate nutrients nor can it expel enough waste to survive To compensate for this
cells can loosely adhere to each other in a liquid medium or develop into multicelled organisms that use circulatory
and respiratory systems to deliver nutrients and remove wastes 31 In an open circulatory system the hearts pump
