range between 30 C and 30 C 22 F to 86 F and drop to below freezing periodically during cold winters
These temperatures mean that temperate forests have defined growing seasons during the spring summer
and early fall Precipitation is relatively constant throughout the year and ranges between 75 cm and 150 cm

Because of the moderate annual rainfall and temperatures deciduous trees are the dominant plant in this
biome Figure 4418 Deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and remain leafless in the winter Thus no
photosynthesis occurs in the deciduous trees during the dormant winter period Each spring new leaves appear
as the temperature increases Because of the dormant period the net primary productivity of temperate forests
is less than that of tropical wet forests In addition temperate forests show less diversity of tree species than
tropical wet forest biomes

The trees of the temperate forests leaf out and shade much of the ground however this biome is more open
than tropical wet forests because most trees in the temperate forests do not grow as tall as the trees in tropical
wet forests The soils of the temperate forests are rich in inorganic and organic nutrients This is due to the
thick layer of leaf litter on forest floors which does not develop in tropical rainforests As this leaf litter decays
nutrients are returned to the soil The leaf litter also protects soil from erosion insulates the ground and provides
habitats for invertebrates such as the pill bug or rolypoly Armadillidium vulgare and their predators such as
the redbacked salamander Plethodon cinereus
Boreal Forests
The boreal forest also known as taiga or coniferous forest is found south of the Arctic Circle and across most
of Canada Alaska Russia and northern Europe Figure 4412 This biome has cold dry winters and short
cool wet summers The annual precipitation is from 40 cm to 100 cm 15739 in and usually takes the form of
snow Little evaporation occurs because of the cold temperatures
The long and cold winters in the boreal forest have led to the predominance of coldtolerant conebearing
coniferous plants These are evergreen coniferous trees like pines spruce and fir which retain their needle
shaped leaves yearround Evergreen trees can photosynthesize earlier in the spring than deciduous trees
because less energy from the sun is required to warm a needlelike leaf than a broad leaf This benefits
evergreen trees which grow faster than deciduous trees in the boreal forest In addition soils in boreal forest
regions tend to be acidic with little available nitrogen Leaves are a nitrogenrich structure and deciduous trees
must produce a new set of these nitrogenrich structures each year Therefore coniferous trees that retain
nitrogenrich needles may have a competitive advantage over the broadleafed deciduous trees
The net primary productivity of boreal forests is lower than that of temperate forests and tropical wet forests
The aboveground biomass of boreal forests is high because these slowgrowing tree species are longlived
and accumulate a large standing biomass over time Plant species diversity is less than that seen in temperate
forests and tropical wet forests Boreal forests lack the pronounced elements of the layered forest structure seen
in tropical wet forests The structure of a boreal forest is often only a tree layer and a ground layer Figure
4419 When conifer needles are dropped they decompose more slowly than broad leaves therefore fewer
nutrients are returned to the soil to fuel plant growth
