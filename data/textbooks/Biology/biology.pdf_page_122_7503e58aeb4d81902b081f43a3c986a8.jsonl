molecules that enter them to quickly diffuse to other parts of the cell Similarly any wastes produced within
a prokaryotic cell can quickly diffuse This is not the case in eukaryotic cells which have developed different
structural adaptations to enhance intracellular transport
Figure 46 This figure shows relative sizes of microbes on a logarithmic scale recall that each unit of increase in a
logarithmic scale represents a 10fold increase in the quantity measured
Small size in general is necessary for all cells whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic Lets examine why that is
so First well consider the area and volume of a typical cell Not all cells are spherical in shape but most tend
to approximate a sphere You may remember from your high school geometry course that the formula for the
surface area of a sphere is 4r2 while the formula for its volume is 4r33 Thus as the radius of a cell increases
its surface area increases as the square of its radius but its volume increases as the cube of its radius much
more rapidly Therefore as a cell increases in size its surface areatovolume ratio decreases This same
principle would apply if the cell had a cube shape Figure 47 If the cell grows too large the plasma membrane
will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased volume In other
words as a cell grows it becomes less efficient One way to become more efficient is to divide Another way
is to develop organelles that perform specific tasks These adaptations lead to developing more sophisticated
cells which we call eukaryotic cells
Figure 47 Notice that as a cell increases in size its surface areatovolume ratio decreases When there is
insufficient surface area to support a cells increasing volume a cell will either divide or die The cell on the left
has a volume of 1 mm3 and a surface area of 6 mm2 with a surface areatovolume ratio of 6 to 1 whereas the
cell on the right has a volume of 8 mm3 and a surface area of 24 mm2 with a surface areatovolume ratio of 3 to
1
Prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells What advantages might small cell size confer on a
cell What advantages might large cell size have
