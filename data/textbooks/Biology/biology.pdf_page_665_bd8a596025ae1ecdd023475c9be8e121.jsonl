Excavata
Many of the protist species classified into the supergroup Excavata are asymmetrical singlecelled organisms
with a feeding groove excavated from one side This supergroup includes heterotrophic predators
photosynthetic species and parasites Its subgroups are the diplomonads parabasalids and euglenozoans
The group includes a variety of modified mitochondria as well as chloroplasts derived from green algae by
secondary endosymbiosis Many of the euglenozoans are freeliving but most diplomonads and parabasalids
are symbionts or parasites
Diplomonads
Among the Excavata are the diplomonads which include the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia Figure
2330 Until recently these protists were believed to lack mitochondria Mitochondrial remnant organelles
called mitosomes have since been identified in diplomonads but although these mitosomes are essentially
nonfunctional as respiratory organelles they do function in iron and sulfur metabolism Diplomonads exist in
anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways such as glycolysis to generate energy Each diplomonad
cell has two similar but not identical haploid nuclei Diplomonads have four pairs of locomotor flagella that are
fairly deeply rooted in basal bodies that lie between the two nuclei
