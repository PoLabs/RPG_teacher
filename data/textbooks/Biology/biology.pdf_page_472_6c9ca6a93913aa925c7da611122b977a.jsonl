Biotechnology is the use of biological agents for technological advancement Biotechnology was used for
breeding livestock and crops long before people understood the scientific basis of these techniques Since the
discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 the biotechnology field has grown rapidly through both academic
research and private companies The primary applications of this technology are in medicine vaccine and
antibiotic production and agriculture crop genetic modification in order to increase yields Biotechnology also
has many industrial applications such as fermentation treating oil spills and producing biofuels Figure 172

antibiotic discovered was penicillin Pharmaceutical companies now commercially produce and test antibiotics for their
potential to inhibit bacterial growth credit advertisement modification of work by NIH credit test plate modification

Basic Techniques to Manipulate Genetic Material DNA and RNA
To understand the basic techniques used to work with nucleic acids remember that nucleic acids are
macromolecules made of nucleotides a sugar a phosphate and a nitrogenous base linked by phosphodiester
bonds The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge An entire set of DNA
molecules in the nucleus is called the genome DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds
between the paired bases Exposure to high temperatures DNA denaturation can separate the two strands
and cooling can reanneal them The DNA polymerase enzyme can replicate the DNA Unlike DNA which is
located in the eukaryotic cells nucleus RNA molecules leave the nucleus The most common type of RNA that
researchers analyze is the messenger RNA mRNA because it represents the proteincoding genes that are
actively expressed However RNA molecules present some other challenges to analysis as they are often less
stable than DNA
DNA and RNA Extraction
To study or manipulate nucleic acids one must first isolate or extract the DNA or RNA from the cells
Researchers use various techniques to extract different types of DNA Figure 173 Most nucleic acid extraction
techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that
are not desired such as unwanted molecule degradation and separation from the DNA sample A lysis buffer
a solution which is mostly a detergent breaks cells Note that lysis means to split These enzymes break
apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes Enzymes such as proteases that break
down proteins inactivate macromolecules and ribonucleases RNAses that break down RNA Using alcohol
precipitates the DNA Human genomic DNA is usually visible as a gelatinous white mass One can store the
DNA samples frozen at 80C for several years
