Sensory photoreceptors absorb light in these particular regions of the visible light spectrum because of the
quality of light available in the daylight spectrum In terrestrial habitats light absorption by chlorophylls peaks in
the blue and red regions of the spectrum As light filters through the canopy and the blue and red wavelengths
are absorbed the spectrum shifts to the farred end shifting the plant community to those plants better adapted
to respond to farred light Bluelight receptors allow plants to gauge the direction and abundance of sunlight
which is rich in bluegreen emissions Water absorbs red light which makes the detection of blue light essential
for algae and aquatic plants
The Phytochrome System and the RedFarRed Response
The phytochromes are a family of chromoproteins with a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore similar to the ringed
tetrapyrrole lightabsorbing head group of chlorophyll Phytochromes have two photointerconvertible forms Pr
and Pfr Pr absorbs red light 667 nm and is immediately converted to Pfr Pfr absorbs farred light 730 nm
and is quickly converted back to Pr Absorption of red or farred light causes a massive change to the shape of
the chromophore altering the conformation and activity of the phytochrome protein to which it is bound Pfr is the
physiologically active form of the protein therefore exposure to red light yields physiological activity Exposure
to farred light inhibits phytochrome activity Together the two forms represent the phytochrome system Figure

The phytochrome system acts as a biological light switch It monitors the level intensity duration and color of
environmental light The effect of red light is reversible by immediately shining farred light on the sample which
converts the chromoprotein to the inactive Pr form Additionally Pfr can slowly revert to Pr in the dark or break
down over time In all instances the physiological response induced by red light is reversed The active form of
phytochrome Pfr can directly activate other molecules in the cytoplasm or it can be trafficked to the nucleus
where it directly activates or represses specific gene expression
Once the phytochrome system evolved plants adapted it to serve a variety of needs Unfiltered full sunlight
contains much more red light than farred light Because chlorophyll absorbs strongly in the red region of the
visible spectrum but not in the farred region any plant in the shade of another plant on the forest floor will be
exposed to reddepleted farredenriched light The preponderance of farred light converts phytochrome in the
shaded leaves to the Pr inactive form slowing growth The nearest nonshaded or even lessshaded areas
on the forest floor have more red light leaves exposed to these areas sense the red light which activates the
Pfr form and induces growth In short plant shoots use the phytochrome system to grow away from shade and
towards light Because competition for light is so fierce in a dense plant community the evolutionary advantages
of the phytochrome system are obvious
In seeds the phytochrome system is not used to determine direction and quality of light shaded versus
unshaded Instead is it used merely to determine if there is any light at all This is especially important in
species with very small seeds such as lettuce Because of their size lettuce seeds have few food reserves
Their seedlings cannot grow for long before they run out of fuel If they germinated even a centimeter under the
soil surface the seedling would never make it into the sunlight and would die In the dark phytochrome is in the
Pr inactive form and the seed will not germinate it will only germinate if exposed to light at the surface of the
soil Upon exposure to light Pr is converted to Pfr and germination proceeds
Figure 3038 The biologically inactive form of phytochrome Pr is converted to the biologically active form Pfr under
illumination with red light Farred light and darkness convert the molecule back to the inactive form
