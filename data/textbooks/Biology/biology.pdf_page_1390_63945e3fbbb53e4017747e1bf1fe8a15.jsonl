Figure 4410 The spring and fall turnovers are important processes in freshwater lakes that act to move the
nutrients and oxygen at the bottom of deep lakes to the top Turnover occurs because water has a maximum
density at 4 C Surface water temperature changes as the seasons progress and denser water sinks
How might turnover in tropical lakes differ from turnover in lakes that exist in temperate regions Think of
the variation or lack of variation in seasonal temperature change
In springtime air temperatures increase and surface ice melts When the temperature of the surface water
begins to approach 4 C the water becomes heavier and sinks to the bottom The water at the bottom of the
lake is then displaced by the heavier and denser surface water and thus rises to the top As that water rises
to the top the sediments and nutrients from the lake bottom are brought along with it This is called the spring
turnover During the summer months the lake water stratifies or forms layers with the warmest water at the
lake surface
As air temperatures drop in the fall the temperature of the lake water cools to 4 C therefore this causes fall
turnover as the heavy cold water sinks and displaces the water at the bottom The oxygenrich water at the
surface of the lake then moves to the bottom of the lake while the nutrients at the bottom of the lake rise to
the surface Figure 4410 During the winter the oxygen at the bottom of the lake is used by decomposers and
other organisms requiring oxygen such as fish It is important to note however that the relative transparency
of ice also allows the penetration of the shorter wavelengths of visible light so that photosynthesis especially by
algae can continue
Temperature
Temperature affects the physiology of organisms as well as the density and state of water Temperature exerts
an important influence on living things because few living things can survive at temperatures below 0 C
32 F due to metabolic constraints It is also rare for living things to survive at temperatures exceeding 45
C 113 F this is a reflection of evolutionary response to typical temperatures near the Earths surface
Enzymes are most efficient within a narrow and specific range of temperatures enzyme degradation can occur
at higher temperatures Therefore organisms either must maintain an internal temperature or they must inhabit
an environment that will keep the body within a temperature range that supports metabolism Some animals
have adapted to enable their bodies to survive significant temperature fluctuations such as seen in hibernation
or reptilian torpor Similarly some Archaea bacteria have evolved to tolerate extremely hot temperatures such
as those found in the geysers within Yellowstone National Park Such bacteria are examples of extremophiles
organisms that thrive in extreme environments
The temperature of both water and air can limit the distribution of living things Animals faced with temperature
fluctuations may respond with adaptations such as migration in order to survive Migration the regular
movement from one place to another is an adaptation found in many animals including many that inhabit
seasonally cold climates Migration solves problems related to temperature locating food and finding a mate
