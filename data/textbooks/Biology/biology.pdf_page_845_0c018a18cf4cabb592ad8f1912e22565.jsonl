head bears an upper lip or labrum and mandibles or derivation of mandibles that serve as mouthparts
maxillae and a lower lip called a labium both of which manipulate food The head also has one pair of
sensory antennae as well as sensory organs such as a pair of compound eyes ocelli simple eyes and
numerous sensory hairs The abdomen usually has 11 segments and bears external reproductive apertures The
subphylum Hexapoda includes some insects that are winged such as fruit flies and others that are secondarily
wingless such as fleas The only order of primitively wingless insects is the Thysanura the bristletails All
other orders are winged or are descendants of formally winged insects
The evolution of wings is a major unsolved mystery Unlike vertebrates whose wings are simply
preadaptations of arms that served as the structural foundations for the evolution of functional wings this has
occurred independently in pterosaurs dinosaurs birds and bats the evolution of wings in insects is a what
we call a de novo new development that has given the pteryogotes domination over the Earth Winged insects
existed over 425 million years ago and by the Carboniferous several orders of winged insects  Paleoptera
most of which are now extinct had evolved There is good physical evidence that Paleozoic nymphs with
thoracic winglets perhaps hinged former gill covers of semiaquatic species used these devices on land to
elevate the thoracic temperature the thorax is where the legs are located to levels that would enable them to
escape predators faster find more food resources and mates and disperse more easily The thoracic winglets
which can be found on fossilized insects preceding the advent of truly winged insects could have easily been
selected for thermoregulatory purposes prior to reaching a size that would have allowed them the capacity for
gliding or actual flapping flight Even modern insects with broadly attached wings such as butterflies use the
basal onethird of their wings the area next to the thorax for thermoregulation and the outer twothirds for flight
camouflage and mate selection
Many of the common insects we encounter on a daily basisincluding ants beetles cockroaches butterflies
crickets and fliesare examples of Hexapoda Among these adult ants beetles flies and butterflies develop
by complete metamorphosis from grublike or caterpillarlike larvae whereas adult cockroaches and crickets
develop through a gradual or incomplete metamorphosis from wingless immatures All growth occurs during the
juvenile stages Adults do not grow further but may become larger after their final molt Variations in wing leg
and mouthpart morphology all contribute to the enormous variety seen in the insects Insect variability was also
encouraged by their activity as pollinators and their coevolution with flowering plants Some insects especially
termites ants bees and wasps are eusocial meaning that they live in large groups with individuals assigned
to specific roles or castes like queen drone and worker Social insects use pheromonesexternal chemical
signalsto communicate and maintain group structure as well as a cohesive colony
