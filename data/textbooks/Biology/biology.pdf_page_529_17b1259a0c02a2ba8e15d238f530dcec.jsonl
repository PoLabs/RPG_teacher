The allele frequency or gene frequency is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population Until
now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms but behind that
phenotypic change is genetic change In population genetics scientists define the term evolution as a change in
the alleles frequency in a population Using the ABO blood type system as an example the frequency of one of
the alleles IA is the number of copies of that allele divided by all the copies of the ABO gene in the population
For example a study in Jordan
1
found a frequency of IA to be 261 percent The IB and I0 alleles comprise
134 percent and 605 percent of the alleles respectively and all of the frequencies added up to 100 percent A
change in this frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population
The allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors therefore
certain alleles become more widespread than others during the natural selection process Natural selection
can alter the populations genetic makeup An example is if a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an
individual to better survive or have more offspring Because many of those offspring will also carry the beneficial
allele and often the corresponding phenotype they will have more offspring of their own that also carry the allele
thus perpetuating the cycle Over time the allele will spread throughout the population Some alleles will quickly
become fixed in this way meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele while detrimental
mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool The gene pool is the
sum of all the alleles in a population
Sometimes allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over
existing allele frequencies We call this phenomenon genetic drift Natural selection and genetic drift usually
occur simultaneously in populations and are not isolated events It is hard to determine which process dominates
because it is often nearly impossible to determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence
We call an event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population which is not typical
of the original population the founder effect Natural selection random drift and founder effects can lead to
significant changes in a populations genome
HardyWeinberg Principle of Equilibrium
In the early twentieth century English mathematician Godfrey Hardy and German physician Wilhelm Weinberg
stated the principle of equilibrium to describe the populations genetic makeup The theory which later became
known as the HardyWeinberg principle of equilibrium states that a populations allele and genotype frequencies
are inherently stable unless some kind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population neither the
allele nor the genotypic frequencies would change The HardyWeinberg principle assumes conditions with no
mutations migration emigration or selective pressure for or against genotype plus an infinite population While
no population can satisfy those conditions the principle offers a useful model against which to compare real
population changes
Working under this theory population geneticists represent different alleles as different variables in their
mathematical models The variable p for example often represents the frequency of a particular allele say Y for
the trait of yellow in Mendels peas while the variable q represents the frequency of y alleles that confer the color
green If these are the only two possible alleles for a given locus in the population p  q  1 In other words all
the p alleles and all the q alleles comprise all of the alleles for that locus in the population
However what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles but the frequencies
of the resulting genotypes known as the populations genetic structure from which scientists can surmise
phenotype distribution If we observe the phenotype we can know only the homozygous recessive alleles
genotype The calculations provide an estimate of the remaining genotypes Since each individual carries two
alleles per gene if we know the allele frequencies p and q predicting the genotypes frequencies is a simple
mathematical calculation to determine the probability of obtaining these genotypes if we draw two alleles at
random from the gene pool In the above scenario an individual pea plant could be pp YY and thus produce
yellow peas pq Yy also yellow or qq yy and thus produce green peas Figure 192 In other words
the frequency of pp individuals is simply p2 the frequency of pq individuals is 2pq and the frequency of qq
individuals is q2 Again if p and q are the only two possible alleles for a given trait in the population these
genotypes frequencies will sum to one p2  2pq  q2  1
