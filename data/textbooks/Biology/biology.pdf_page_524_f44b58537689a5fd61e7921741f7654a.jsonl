a
mutation
b
natural selection
c
overbreeding
d
sexual reproduction
5 Which of the following situations will lead to natural
selection

The seeds of two plants land near each
other and one grows larger than the other
b
Two types of fish eat the same kind of food
and one is better able to gather food than
the other
c
Male lions compete for the right to mate with
females with only one possible winner
d
all of the above
6 Which description is an example of a phenotype
a
A certain duck has a blue beak
b
A mutation occurred to a flower
c
Most cheetahs live solitary lives
d
both a and c
7 Which situation is most likely an example of
convergent evolution
a
Squid and humans have eyes similar in
structure
b
Worms and snakes both move without legs
c
Some bats and birds have wings that allow
them to fly
d
all of the above
8 Which situation would most likely lead to allopatric
speciation
a
Flood causes the formation of a new lake
b
A storm causes several large trees to fall
down
c
A mutation causes a new trait to develop
d
An injury causes an organism to seek out a
new food source
9 What is the main difference between dispersal and
vicariance
a
One leads to allopatric speciation whereas
the other leads to sympatric speciation
b
One involves the movement of the
organism and the other involves a change
in the environment
c
One depends on a genetic mutation
occurring and the other does not
d
One involves closely related organisms and
the other involves only individuals of the
same species
10 Which variable increases the likelihood of
allopatric speciation taking place more quickly
a
lower rate of mutation
b
longer distance between divided groups
c
increased instances of hybrid formation
d
equivalent numbers of individuals in each
population
11 What is the main difference between
autopolyploid and allopolyploid
a
the number of chromosomes
b
the functionality of the chromosomes
c
the source of the extra chromosomes
d
the number of mutations in the extra
chromosomes
12 Which reproductive combination produces
hybrids
a
when individuals of the same species in
different geographical areas reproduce
b
when any two individuals sharing the same
habitat reproduce
c
when members of closely related species
reproduce
d
when offspring of the same parents
reproduce
13 Which condition is the basis for a species to be
reproductively isolated from other members
a
It does not share its habitat with related
species
b
It does not exist out of a single habitat
c
It does not exchange genetic information
with other species
d
It does not undergo evolutionary changes
for a significant period of time
14 Which situation is not an example of a prezygotic
barrier
a
Two species of turtles breed at different
times of the year
b
Two species of flowers attract different
pollinators
c
Two species of birds display different mating
dances
d
Two species of insects produce infertile
offspring
15 Which term is used to describe the continued
divergence of species based on the low fitness of
hybrid offspring
a
reinforcement
b
fusion
c
stability
d
punctuated equilibrium
16 Which components of speciation would be least
likely to be a part of punctuated equilibrium
a
a division of populations
b
a change in environmental conditions
c
ongoing gene flow among all individuals
d
a large number of mutations taking place at
once
