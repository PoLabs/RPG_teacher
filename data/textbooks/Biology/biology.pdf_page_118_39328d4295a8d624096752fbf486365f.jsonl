Several cells of one kind that interconnect with each other and perform a shared function form tissues These
tissues combine to form an organ your stomach heart or brain and several organs comprise an organ system
such as the digestive system circulatory system or nervous system Several systems that function together
form an organism like a human being Here we will examine the structure and function of cells
There are many types of cells which scientists group into one of two broad categories prokaryotic and
eukaryotic For example we classify both animal and plant cells as eukaryotic cells whereas we classify
bacterial cells as prokaryotic Before discussing the criteria for determining whether a cell is prokaryotic or
eukaryotic we will first examine how biologists study cells
Microscopy
Cells vary in size With few exceptions we cannot see individual cells with the naked eye so scientists use
microscopes micro  small scope  to look at to study them A microscope is an instrument that
magnifies an object We photograph most cells with a microscope so we can call these images micrographs
The optics of a microscopes lenses change the image orientation that the user sees A specimen that is right
side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upsidedown and facing left when one views through
a microscope and vice versa Similarly if one moves the slide left while looking through the microscope it will
appear to move right and if one moves it down it will seem to move up This occurs because microscopes use
two sets of lenses to magnify the image Because of the manner by which light travels through the lenses this
two lens system produces an inverted image binocular or dissecting microscopes work in a similar manner but
include an additional magnification system that makes the final image appear to be upright
Light Microscopes
To give you a sense of cell size a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight
micrometers abbreviated as eight m in diameter A pin head is about two thousandths of a meter two mm in
diameter That means about 250 red blood cells could fit on a pinhead
Most student microscopes are light microscopes Figure 42a Visible light passes and bends through the
lens system to enable the user to see the specimen Light microscopes are advantageous for viewing living
organisms but since individual cells are generally transparent their components are not distinguishable unless
they are colored with special stains Staining however usually kills the cells
Light microscopes that undergraduates commonly use in the laboratory magnify up to approximately 400 times
Two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and resolving power Magnification is the
process of enlarging an object in appearance Resolving power is the microscopes ability to distinguish two
adjacent structures as separate the higher the resolution the better the images clarity and detail When one
uses oil immersion lenses to study small objects magnification usually increases to 1000 times In order to gain
a better understanding of cellular structure and function scientists typically use electron microscopes
Figure 42 a Most light microscopes in a college biology lab can magnify cells up to approximately 400 times and
have a resolution of about 200 nanometers b Electron microscopes provide a much higher magnification 100000x
and a have a resolution of 50 picometers credit a modification of work by GcGWikimedia Commons credit b
