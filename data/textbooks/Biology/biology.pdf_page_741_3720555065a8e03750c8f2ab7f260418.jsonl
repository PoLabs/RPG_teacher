Figure 261 Seed plants dominate the landscape and play an enormous and integral role in the success of all human
societies Here are a few examples a Palm trees grow along the shoreline serving numerous purposes for food
shelter and even transportation b wheat is an important crop grown throughout most of the world c the fruit of the
cotton plant produces fibers that are woven into fabric d the potent alkaloids of the beautiful opium poppy have long
influenced human life both as a medicinal remedy and as a dangerously addictive drug credit a modification of work

264 The Role of Seed Plants
Introduction
The lush palms on tropical shorelines do not depend on water for the dispersal of their pollen fertilization or
the survival of the zygoteunlike mosses liverworts and ferns living within the same terrain These palms are
seed plants which have broken free from the need to rely on water for their reproductive needs The seed plants
play an integral role in all aspects of life on the planet shaping the physical terrain influencing the climate and
maintaining life as we know it For millennia human societies have depended on seed plants for nutrition and
medicinal compounds Somewhat more recently seed plants have served as a source of manufactured products
such as timber and paper dyes and textiles As an example multiple uses have been found for each of the
plants shown above Palms provide materials including rattans oils and dates Grains like wheat are grown to
feed both human and animal populations or fermented to produce alcoholic beverages The fruit of the cotton
flower is harvested as a boll with its fibers transformed into clothing or pulp for paper The showy opium poppy
is valued both as an ornamental flower and as a source of potent opiate compounds
