Carbon Dating
Carbon is normally present in the atmosphere in the form of gaseous compounds like carbon dioxide and
methane Carbon14 14C is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere from
atmospheric 14N nitrogen by the addition of a neutron and the loss of a proton because of cosmic rays
This is a continuous process so more 14C is always being created As a living organism incorporates 14C
initially as carbon dioxide fixed in the process of photosynthesis the relative amount of 14C in its body is
equal to the concentration of 14C in the atmosphere When an organism dies it is no longer ingesting 14C
so the ratio between 14C and 12C will decline as 14C decays gradually to 14N by a process called beta
decayelectrons or positrons emission This decay emits energy in a slow process
After approximately 5730 years half of the starting concentration of 14C will convert back to 14N We call
the time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable form its
halflife Because the halflife of 14C is long scientists use it to date formerly living objects such as old bones
or wood Comparing the ratio of the 14C concentration in an object to the amount of 14C in the atmosphere
scientists can determine the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed On the basis of this amount
Figure 24 shows that we can calculate the age of the material such as the pygmy mammoth with accuracy
if it is not much older than about 50000 years Other elements have isotopes with different half lives For
example 40K potassium40 has a halflife of 125 billion years and 235U Uranium 235 has a halflife of
about 700 million years Through the use of radiometric dating scientists can study the age of fossils or
other remains of extinct organisms to understand how organisms have evolved from earlier species
