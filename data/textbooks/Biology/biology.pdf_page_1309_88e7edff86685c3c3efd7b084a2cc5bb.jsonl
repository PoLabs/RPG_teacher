juxtamedullary nephrons are found in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla The nephron filters and
exchanges water and solutes with two sets of blood vessels and the tissue fluid in the kidneys
There are three steps in the formation of urine glomerular filtration which occurs in the glomerulus tubular
reabsorption which occurs in the renal tubules and tubular secretion which also occurs in the renal tubules
413 Excretion Systems
Many systems have evolved for excreting wastes that are simpler than the kidney and urinary systems of
vertebrate animals The simplest system is that of contractile vacuoles present in microorganisms Flame cells
and nephridia in worms perform excretory functions and maintain osmotic balance Some insects have evolved
Malpighian tubules to excrete wastes and maintain osmotic balance
414 Nitrogenous Wastes
Ammonia is the waste produced by metabolism of nitrogencontaining compounds like proteins and nucleic
acids While aquatic animals can easily excrete ammonia into their watery surroundings terrestrial animals
have evolved special mechanisms to eliminate the toxic ammonia from their systems Urea is the major
byproduct of ammonia metabolism in vertebrate animals Uric acid is the major byproduct of ammonia
metabolism in birds terrestrial arthropods and reptiles
415 Hormonal Control of Osmoregulatory Functions
Hormonal cues help the kidneys synchronize the osmotic needs of the body Hormones like epinephrine
norepinephrine reninangiotensin aldosterone antidiuretic hormone and atrial natriuretic peptide help
regulate the needs of the body as well as the communication between the different organ systems
VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS
1 Figure 415 Which of the following statements
about the kidney is false
a
The renal pelvis drains into the ureter
b
The renal pyramids are in the medulla
c
The cortex covers the capsule
d
Nephrons are in the renal cortex
2 Figure 416 Which of the following statements
about the nephron is false
a
The collecting duct empties into the distal
convoluted tubule
b
The Bowmans capsule surrounds the
glomerulus
c
The loop of Henle is between the proximal
and distal convoluted tubules
d
The loop of Henle empties into the distal
convoluted tubule
3 Figure 418 Loop diuretics are drugs sometimes
used to treat hypertension These drugs inhibit the
reabsorption of Na and Cl ions by the ascending
limb of the loop of Henle A side effect is that they
increase urination Why do you think this is the case

saline at a concentration that is isotonic with
respect to body fluids

intracellular fluid
b
extracellular fluid
c
blood plasma
d
none of the above
6 Cells in a hypertonic solution tend to
a
shrink due to water loss
