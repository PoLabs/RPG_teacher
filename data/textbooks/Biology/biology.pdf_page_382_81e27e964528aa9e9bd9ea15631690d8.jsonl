individual will not develop in utero
Scientists have identified and characterized several errors in sex chromosome number Individuals with three
X chromosomes triploX are phenotypically female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility
The XXY genotype corresponding to one type of Klinefelter syndrome corresponds to phenotypically male
individuals with small testes enlarged breasts and reduced body hair More complex types of Klinefelter
syndrome exist in which the individual has as many as five X chromosomes In all types every X chromosome
except one undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic dosage We see this as several
Barr bodies in each cell nucleus Turner syndrome characterized as an X0 genotype ie only a single sex
chromosome corresponds to a phenotypically female individual with short stature webbed skin in the neck
region hearing and cardiac impairments and sterility
Duplications and Deletions
In addition to losing or gaining an entire chromosome a chromosomal segment may duplicate or lose itself
Duplications and deletions often produce offspring that survive but exhibit physical and mental abnormalities
Duplicated chromosomal segments may fuse to existing chromosomes or may be free in the nucleus Cridu
chat from the French for cry of the cat is a syndrome that occurs with nervous system abnormalities and
identifiable physical features that result from a deletion of most 5p the small arm of chromosome 5 Figure
1310 Infants with this genotype emit a characteristic highpitched cry on which the disorders name is based
Figure 1310 This figure shows an individual with criduchat syndrome at two four nine and 12 years of age credit

Chromosomal Structural Rearrangements
Cytologists have characterized numerous structural rearrangements in chromosomes but chromosome
inversions and translocations are the most common We can identify both during meiosis by the adaptive
pairing of rearranged chromosomes with their former homologs to maintain appropriate gene alignment If the
genes on two homologs are not oriented correctly a recombination event could result in losing genes from one
chromosome and gaining genes on the other This would produce aneuploid gametes
