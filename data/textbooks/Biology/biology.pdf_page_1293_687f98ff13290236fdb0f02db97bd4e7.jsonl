Figure 415 The internal structure of the kidney is shown credit modification of work by NCI
Which of the following statements about the kidney is false
a
The renal pelvis drains into the ureter
b
The renal pyramids are in the medulla
c
The cortex covers the capsule
d
Nephrons are in the renal cortex
Because the kidney filters blood its network of blood vessels is an important component of its structure and
function The arteries veins and nerves that supply the kidney enter and exit at the renal hilum Renal blood
supply starts with the branching of the aorta into the renal arteries which are each named based on the
region of the kidney they pass through and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena
cava The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys Each segmental artery
splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns which supply the renal lobes The
interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries The arcuate
bow shaped arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids Cortical radiate arteries as the
name suggests radiate out from the arcuate arteries The cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous afferent
arterioles and then enter the capillaries supplying the nephrons Veins trace the path of the arteries and have
similar names except there are no segmental veins
As mentioned previously the functional unit of the kidney is the nephron illustrated in Figure 416 Each kidney
is made up of over one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex giving it a granular appearance when sectioned
sagittally There are two types of nephrons cortical nephrons 85 percent which are deep in the renal
cortex and juxtamedullary nephrons 15 percent which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla A
nephron consists of three partsa renal corpuscle a renal tubule and the associated capillary network which
originates from the cortical radiate arteries
