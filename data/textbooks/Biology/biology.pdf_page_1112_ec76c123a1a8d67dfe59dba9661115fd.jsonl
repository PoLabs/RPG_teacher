KEY TERMS
neurotransmitter released by neurons in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous
system
selfpropagating momentary change in the electrical potential of a neuron or muscle
membrane
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by problems with memory and thinking
structure within the limbic system that processes fear
spiderweblike middle layer of the meninges that cover the central nervous system
glial cell in the central nervous system that provide nutrients extracellular buffering and structural
support for neurons also makes up the bloodbrain barrier
neurodevelopmental
disorder
characterized
by
difficulty
maintaining attention and controlling impulses
neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction
and communication abilities
part of the peripheral nervous system that controls bodily functions
tubelike structure that propagates a signal from a neurons cell body to axon terminals
electrically sensitive structure on the cell body of a neuron that integrates signals from multiple
neuronal connections
structure on the end of an axon that can form a synapse with another neuron
interconnected collections of cells in the brain that are involved in movement and motivation also
known as basal nuclei
see basal ganglia
portion of the brain that connects with the spinal cord controls basic nervous system functions like
breathing heart rate and swallowing
brain structure involved in posture motor coordination and learning new motor actions
outermost sheet of brain tissue involved in many higherorder functions
clear liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord and fills the ventricles and
central canal acts as a shock absorber and circulates material throughout the brain and spinal cord
spongy tissue within ventricles that produces cerebrospinal fluid
helps regulate emotions and pain thought to directly drive the bodys conscious response to
unpleasant experiences
thick fiber bundle that connects the cerebral hemispheres
sensory andor motor nerve that emanates from the brain
structure that extends away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons
change in the membrane potential to a less negative value
tough outermost layer that covers the central nervous system
cell that lines fluidfilled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord involved in
