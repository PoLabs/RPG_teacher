After the fire though these trees are no longer dominant Thus the first plants to grow back are usually annual
plants followed within a few years by quickly growing and spreading grasses and other pioneer species Due
to at least in part changes in the environment brought on by the growth of the grasses and other species
over many years shrubs will emerge along with small pine oak and hickory trees These organisms are
called intermediate species Eventually over 150 years the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species
composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire This equilibrium state is referred
to as the climax community which will remain stable until the next disturbance

457  Behavioral Biology Proximate and Ultimate
Causes of Behavior
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Compare innate and learned behavior

Discuss how movement and migration behaviors are a result of natural selection

Discuss the different ways members of a population communicate with each other

Give examples of how species use energy for mating displays and other courtship behaviors

Differentiate between various mating systems

Describe different ways that species learn
Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus Behavioral biology is the study
of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the
pressures of natural selection is not new For decades several types of scientists have studied animal behavior
Biologists do so in the science of ethology psychologists in the science of comparative psychology and other
scientists in the science of neurobiology The first two ethology and comparative psychology are the most
consequential for the study of behavioral biology
One goal of behavioral biology is to the innate behaviors which have a strong genetic component and are
largely independent of environmental influences from the learned behaviors which result from environmental
conditioning Innate behavior or instinct is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being
learned They are hard wired into the system On the other hand learned behaviors although riskier are
flexible dynamic and can be altered according to changes in the environment
Innate Behaviors Movement and Migration
Innate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli The simplest example of this is a reflex action an
involuntary and rapid response to stimulus To test the kneejerk reflex a doctor taps the patellar tendon below
the kneecap with a rubber hammer The stimulation of the nerves leads to the reflex of extending the leg at the
knee This is similar to the reaction of someone who touches a hot stove and instinctually pulls his or her hand
away Even humans with our great capacity to learn still exhibit a variety of innate behaviors
