Figure 17 Scientists use two types of reasoning inductive and deductive reasoning to advance scientific
knowledge As is the case in this example the conclusion from inductive reasoning can often become the premise
for deductive reasoning
Decide if each of the following is an example of inductive or deductive reasoning
1
All flying birds and insects have wings Birds and insects flap their wings as they move through the air
Therefore wings enable flight
2
Insects generally survive mild winters better than harsh ones Therefore insect pests will become more
problematic if global temperatures increase
3
Chromosomes the carriers of DNA are distributed evenly between the daughter cells during cell
division Therefore each daughter cell will have the same chromosome set as the mother cell
4
Animals as diverse as humans insects and wolves all exhibit social behavior Therefore social
behavior must have an evolutionary advantage
The scientific method may seem too rigid and structured It is important to keep in mind that although scientists
often follow this sequence there is flexibility Sometimes an experiment leads to conclusions that favor a change
in approach Often an experiment brings entirely new scientific questions to the puzzle Many times science
does not operate in a linear fashion Instead scientists continually draw inferences and make generalizations
finding patterns as their research proceeds Scientific reasoning is more complex than the scientific method
alone suggests Notice too that we can apply the scientific method to solving problems that arent necessarily
scientific in nature
