442  Biogeography
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Define biogeography

List and describe abiotic factors that affect the global distribution of plant and animal species

Compare the impact of abiotic forces on aquatic and terrestrial environments

Summarize the effects of abiotic factors on net primary productivity
Many forces influence the communities of living organisms present in different parts of the biosphere all of the
parts of Earth inhabited by life The biosphere extends into the atmosphere several kilometers above Earth
and into the depths of the oceans Despite its apparent vastness to an individual human the biosphere occupies
only a minute space when compared to the known universe Many abiotic forces influence where life can exist
and the types of organisms found in different parts of the biosphere The abiotic factors influence the distribution
of biomes large areas of land with similar climate flora and fauna
Biogeography
Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their
distribution Abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation As
these abiotic factors change the composition of plant and animal communities also changes For example if you
were to begin a journey at the equator and walk north you would notice gradual changes in plant communities
At the beginning of your journey you would see tropical wet forests with broadleaved evergreen trees which are
characteristic of plant communities found near the equator As you continued to travel north you would see these
broadleaved evergreen plants eventually give rise to seasonally dry forests with scattered trees You would also
begin to notice changes in temperature and moisture At about 30 degrees north these forests would give way
to deserts which are characterized by low precipitation and high insolation sunlight
Moving farther north you would see that deserts are replaced by grasslands or prairies Eventually grasslands
are replaced by deciduous temperate forests These deciduous forests give way to the boreal forests and taiga
found in the subarctic the area south of the Arctic Circle Finally you would reach the Arctic tundra which is
found at the most northern latitudes This trek north reveals gradual changes in both climate and the types of
organisms that have adapted to environmental factors associated with ecosystems found at different latitudes
However different ecosystems exist at the same latitude due in part to abiotic factors such as jet streams the
Gulf Stream and ocean currents If you were to hike up a mountain the changes you would see in the vegetation
would parallel in many ways those as you move to higher latitudes
Ecologists who study biogeography examine patterns of species distribution No species exists everywhere for
example the Venus flytrap Dionaea muscipula is endemic to a small area in North and South Carolina An
endemic species is one which is naturally found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted
in size Other species are generalists species which live in a wide variety of geographic areas the raccoon
Procyon spp for example is native to most of North and Central America
Species distribution patterns are based on biotic and abiotic factors and their influences during the very long
periods of time required for species evolution therefore early studies of biogeography were closely linked to
the emergence of evolutionary thinking in the eighteenth century Some of the most distinctive assemblages of
plants and animals occur in regions that have been physically separated for millions of years by geographic
barriers Biologists estimate that Australia for example has between 600000 and 700000 species of plants and
animals Approximately 34 of living plant and mammal species are endemic species found solely in Australia
