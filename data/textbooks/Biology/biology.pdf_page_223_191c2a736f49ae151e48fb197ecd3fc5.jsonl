Figure 712 In oxidative phosphorylation the pH gradient formed by the electron transport chain is used by ATP
synthase to form ATP
Cyanide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase a component of the electron transport chain If cyanide poisoning
occurs would you expect the pH of the intermembrane space to increase or decrease What effect would
cyanide have on ATP synthesis
ATP Yield
The number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies For example the number of
hydrogen ions that the electron transport chain complexes can pump through the membrane varies between
species Another source of variance stems from the shuttle of electrons across the membranes of the
mitochondria The NADH generated from glycolysis cannot easily enter mitochondria Thus electrons are
picked up on the inside of mitochondria by either NAD or FAD As you have learned earlier these FAD
molecules can transport fewer ions consequently fewer ATP molecules are generated when FAD acts as a
carrier NAD is used as the electron transporter in the liver and FAD acts in the brain
Another factor that affects the yield of ATP molecules generated from glucose is the fact that intermediate
compounds in these pathways are also used for other purposes Glucose catabolism connects with the pathways
that build or break down all other biochemical compounds in cells and the result is somewhat messier than the
ideal situations described thus far For example sugars other than glucose are fed into the glycolytic pathway
for energy extraction In addition the fivecarbon sugars that form nucleic acids are made from intermediates
in glycolysis Certain nonessential amino acids can be made from intermediates of both glycolysis and the citric
acid cycle Lipids such as cholesterol and triglycerides are also made from intermediates in these pathways
and both amino acids and triglycerides are broken down for energy through these pathways Overall in living
systems these pathways of glucose catabolism extract about 34 percent of the energy contained in glucose
with the remainder being released as heat
