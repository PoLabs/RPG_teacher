young age before it leaves any offspring to the next generation all of its genes110 of the populations gene
poolwill be suddenly lost In a population of 100 thats only 1 percent of the overall gene pool therefore it is
much less impactful on the populations genetic structure

genetic drift in action
Natural events such as an earthquake disaster that killsat randoma large portion of the population can
magnify genetic drift Known as the bottleneck effect it results in suddenly wiping out a large portion of
the genome Figure 195 At once the survivors genetic structure becomes the entire populations genetic
structure which may be very different from the predisaster population
Figure 195 A chance event or catastrophe can reduce the genetic variability within a population
Another scenario in which populations might experience a strong influence of genetic drift is if some portion of the
population leaves to start a new population in a new location or if a physical barrier divides a population In this
situation those individuals are an unlikely representation of the entire population which results in the founder
effect The founder effect occurs when the genetic structure changes to match that of the new populations
founding fathers and mothers Researchers believe that the founder effect was a key factor in the genetic history
of the Afrikaner population of Dutch settlers in South Africa as evidenced by mutations that are common in
Afrikaners but rare in most other populations This is probably because a higherthannormal proportion of the
founding colonists carried these mutations As a result the population expresses unusually high incidences of
Huntingtons disease HD and Fanconi anemia FA a genetic disorder known to cause blood marrow and
congenital abnormalitieseven cancer
