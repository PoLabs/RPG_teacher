The inner hair cells are most important for conveying auditory information to the brain About 90 percent of the
afferent neurons carry information from inner hair cells with each hair cell synapsing with 10 or so neurons
Outer hair cells connect to only 10 percent of the afferent neurons and each afferent neuron innervates many
hair cells The afferent bipolar neurons that convey auditory information travel from the cochlea to the medulla
through the pons and midbrain in the brainstem finally reaching the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe
Vestibular Information
The stimuli associated with the vestibular system are linear acceleration gravity and angular acceleration and
deceleration Gravity acceleration and deceleration are detected by evaluating the inertia on receptive cells
in the vestibular system Gravity is detected through head position Angular acceleration and deceleration are
expressed through turning or tilting of the head
The vestibular system has some similarities with the auditory system It utilizes hair cells just like the auditory
system but it excites them in different ways There are five vestibular receptor organs in the inner ear the utricle
the saccule and three semicircular canals Together they make up whats known as the vestibular labyrinth that
is shown in Figure 3616 The utricle and saccule respond to acceleration in a straight line such as gravity The
roughly 30000 hair cells in the utricle and 16000 hair cells in the saccule lie below a gelatinous layer with their
stereocilia projecting into the gelatin Embedded in this gelatin are calcium carbonate crystalslike tiny rocks
When the head is tilted the crystals continue to be pulled straight down by gravity but the new angle of the head
causes the gelatin to shift thereby bending the stereocilia The bending of the stereocilia stimulates the neurons
and they signal to the brain that the head is tilted allowing the maintenance of balance It is the vestibular branch
of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve that deals with balance

The fluidfilled semicircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles They are arranged in three spatial
planes The base of each canal has a swelling that contains a cluster of hair cells The hairs project into a
gelatinous cap called the cupula and monitor angular acceleration and deceleration from rotation They would be
stimulated by driving your car around a corner turning your head or falling forward One canal lies horizontally
while the other two lie at about 45 degree angles to the horizontal axis as illustrated in Figure 3616 When the
brain processes input from all three canals together it can detect angular acceleration or deceleration in three
dimensions When the head turns the fluid in the canals shifts thereby bending stereocilia and sending signals
to the brain Upon cessation accelerating or deceleratingor just movingthe movement of the fluid within the
canals slows or stops For example imagine holding a glass of water When moving forward water may splash
backwards onto the hand and when motion has stopped water may splash forward onto the fingers While in
motion the water settles in the glass and does not splash Note that the canals are not sensitive to velocity itself
but to changes in velocity so moving forward at 60mph with your eyes closed would not give the sensation of
movement but suddenly accelerating or braking would stimulate the receptors

Hair cells from the utricle saccule and semicircular canals also communicate through bipolar neurons to
the cochlear nucleus in the medulla Cochlear neurons send descending projections to the spinal cord and
