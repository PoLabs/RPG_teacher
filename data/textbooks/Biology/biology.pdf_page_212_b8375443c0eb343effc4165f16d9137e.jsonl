Figure 73 ATP adenosine triphosphate has three phosphate groups that can be removed by hydrolysis addition
of H2O to form ADP adenosine diphosphate or AMP adenosine monophosphate The negative charges on the
phosphate group naturally repel each other requiring energy to bond them together and releasing energy when these
bonds are broken
The addition of a phosphate group to a molecule requires energy Phosphate groups are negatively charged and
thus repel one another when they are arranged in series as they are in ADP and ATP This repulsion makes the
ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP a process
called dephosphorylation releases energy
Energy from ATP
Hydrolysis is the process of breaking complex macromolecules apart During hydrolysis water is split or lysed
and the resulting hydrogen atom H and a hydroxyl group OH or hydroxide are added to the larger
molecule The hydrolysis of ATP produces ADP together with an inorganic phosphate ion Pi and the release
of free energy To carry out life processes ATP is continuously broken down into ADP and like a rechargeable
battery ADP is continuously regenerated into ATP by the reattachment of a third phosphate group Water which
was broken down into its hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group hydroxide during ATP hydrolysis is regenerated
when a third phosphate is added to the ADP molecule reforming ATP
Obviously energy must be infused into the system to regenerate ATP Where does this energy come from In
nearly every living thing on Earth the energy comes from the metabolism of glucose fructose or galactose all
isomers with the chemical formula C6H12O6 but different molecular configurations In this way ATP is a direct link
between the limited set of exergonic pathways of glucose catabolism and the multitude of endergonic pathways
that power living cells
Phosphorylation
Recall that in some chemical reactions enzymes may bind to several substrates that react with each other on
the enzyme forming an intermediate complex An intermediate complex is a temporary structure and it allows
one of the substrates such as ATP and reactants to more readily react with each other in reactions involving
ATP ATP is one of the substrates and ADP is a product During an endergonic chemical reaction ATP forms
an intermediate complex with the substrate and enzyme in the reaction This intermediate complex allows the
ATP to transfer its third phosphate group with its energy to the substrate a process called phosphorylation
Phosphorylation refers to the addition of the phosphate P This is illustrated by the following generic
reaction in which A and B represent two different substrates
A  enzyme  ATP  

A  enzyme  P

  B  enzyme  ADP  phosphate ion
When the intermediate complex breaks apart the energy is used to modify the substrate and convert it into a
product of the reaction The ADP molecule and a free phosphate ion are released into the medium and are
available for recycling through cell metabolism
Substrate Phosphorylation
ATP is generated through two mechanisms during the breakdown of glucose A few ATP molecules are
generated that is regenerated from ADP as a direct result of the chemical reactions that occur in the catabolic
pathways A phosphate group is removed from an intermediate reactant in the pathway and the free energy of
