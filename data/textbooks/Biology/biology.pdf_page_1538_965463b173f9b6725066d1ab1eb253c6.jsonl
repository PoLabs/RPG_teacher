However the inside of this channel must contain hydrophilic amino acids since they will interact with the traveling water
molecules 35 The four types of RNA are messenger RNA ribosomal RNA transfer RNA and microRNA Messenger
RNA carries the information from the DNA that controls all cellular activities The mRNA binds to the ribosomes that are
constructed of proteins and rRNA and tRNA transfers the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis microRNA
regulates the availability of mRNA for translation

1 Figure 47 Substances can diffuse more quickly through small cells Small cells have no need for organelles and
therefore do not need to expend energy getting substances across organelle membranes Large cells have organelles
that can separate cellular processes enabling them to build molecules that are more complex 3 Figure 418 It would
end up on the outside After the vesicle passes through the Golgi apparatus and fuses with the plasma membrane it
turns inside out 4 C 6 D 8 D 10 B 12 D 14 A 16 C 18 D 20 D 22 C 24 D 25 A light microscope would be ideal
when viewing a small living organism especially when the cell has been stained to reveal details 27 A transmission
electron microscope would be ideal for viewing the cells internal structures because many of the internal structures
have membranes that are not visible by the light microscope 29 The cell theory states
All living things are
made of cellsCells are the most basic unit of lifeNew cells arise from existing cells All humans are multicellular
organisms whose smallest building blocks are cells Adult humans begin with the fusion of a male gamete cell with
a female gamete cell to form a fertilized egg single cell That cell then divides into two cells which each divides
into two more cells and so forth until all the cells of a human embryo are made As the embryo passes through all
the developmental stages to make an adult human the cells that are added arise from division of existing cells 31
Some microbes are beneficial For instance E coli bacteria populate the human gut and help break down fiber in
the diet Some foods such as yogurt are formed by bacteria 33 Both are similar in that they are enveloped in a
double membrane both have an intermembrane space and both make ATP Both mitochondria and chloroplasts have
DNA and mitochondria have inner folds called cristae and a matrix while chloroplasts have chlorophyll and accessory
pigments in the thylakoids that form stacks grana and a stroma 35 Form follows function refers to the idea that the
function of a body part dictates the form of that body part As an example compare your arm to a bats wing While
the bones of the two correspond the parts serve different functions in each organism and their forms have adapted
to follow that function 37 Centrioles and flagella are alike in that they are made up of microtubules In centrioles two
rings of nine microtubule triplets are arranged at right angles to one another This arrangement does not occur in
flagella 39 A macrophage engulfs a pathogen by rearranging its actin microfilaments to bend the plasma membrane
around the pathogen Once the pathogen is sealed in an endosome inside the macrophage the vesicle is walked
along microtubules until it combines with a lysosome to digest the pathogen 41 They differ because plant cell walls
are rigid Plasmodesmata which a plant cell needs for transportation and communication are able to allow movement
of really large molecules Gap junctions are necessary in animal cells for transportation and communication 43 E coli
infections generally cause food poisoning meaning that the invading bacteria cross from the lumen of the gut into the
rest of the body Tight junctions hold the epithelial layer that lines the digestive tract together so that the material that
crosses into the body is tightly regulated One way E coli can avoid this regulation is to destroy the tight junctions so
that it can enter the body between the epithelial cells rather than having to go through the cells

1 Figure 512 No it must have been hypotonic as a hypotonic solution would cause water to enter the cells thereby
making them burst 3 Figure 519 A decrease in pH means an increase in positively charged H ions and an increase
in the electrical gradient across the membrane The transport of amino acids into the cell will increase 4 A 6 A 8
C 10 A 12 D 14 D 16 B 18 C 20 B 21 The fluid characteristic of the cell membrane allows greater flexibility to
the cell than it would if the membrane were rigid It also allows the motion of membrane components required for
some types of membrane transport 23 Peripheral proteins can bind to other molecules in the extracellular space
However they cannot directly transmit a signal to the inside of the cell since they do not have a transmembrane domain
region that goes through the plasma membrane to the inside of the cell They must associate with integral membrane
proteins in order to pass the signal to the inside of the cell 25 Water moves through a membrane in osmosis because
there is a concentration gradient across the membrane of solute and solvent The solute cannot effectively move to
balance the concentration on both sides of the membrane so water moves to achieve this balance 27 Decreasing
temperature will decrease the kinetic energy in the system A lower temperature means less energy in the molecules
so they will move at a slower speed Lowering temperature also decreases the kinetic energy of the molecules in
the plasma membrane compressing them together This increases the density of the plasma membrane which slows
diffusion into the cell 29 The cell harvests energy from ATP produced by its own metabolism to power active transport
processes such as the activity of pumps 31 Intestinal epithelial cells use active transport to fulfill their specific role as
the cells that transfer glucose from the digested food to the bloodstream Intestinal cells are exposed to an environment
with fluctuating glucose levels Immediately after eating glucose in the gut lumen will be high and could accumulate
in intestinal cells by diffusion However when the gut lumen is empty glucose levels are higher in the intestinal cells If
glucose moved by facilitated diffusion this would cause glucose to flow back out of the intestinal cells and into the gut
