and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side The atria are the chambers
that receive blood and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood The right atrium receives deoxygenated
blood from the superior vena cava which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from
the veins that come from the arms as well as from the inferior vena cava which drains blood from the veins
that come from the lower organs and the legs In addition the right atrium receives blood from the coronary
sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right
ventricle through the atrioventricular valve or the tricuspid valve a flap of connective tissue that opens in
only one direction to prevent the backflow of blood The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the
heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve After it is filled the right ventricle pumps the blood through
the pulmonary arteries bypassing the semilunar valve or pulmonic valve to the lungs for reoxygenation After
blood passes through the pulmonary arteries the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing
backwards into the right ventricle The left atrium then receives the oxygenrich blood from the lungs via the
pulmonary veins This blood passes through the bicuspid valve or mitral valve the atrioventricular valve on
the left side of the heart to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through the aorta the major artery
of the body taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body Once blood is pumped out of the
left ventricle and into the aorta the aortic semilunar valve or aortic valve closes preventing blood from flowing
backward into the left ventricle This pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all
mammals
