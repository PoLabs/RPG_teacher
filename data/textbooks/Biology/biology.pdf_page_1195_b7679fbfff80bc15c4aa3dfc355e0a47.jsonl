Each vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the nerves of the spinal cord pass There is
also a notch on each side through which the spinal nerves which serve the body at that level can exit from the
spinal cord The vertebral column is approximately 71 cm 28 inches in adult male humans and is curved which
can be seen from a side view The names of the spinal curves correspond to the region of the spine in which
they occur The thoracic and sacral curves are concave curve inwards relative to the front of the body and the
cervical and lumbar curves are convex curve outwards relative to the front of the body The arched curvature
of the vertebral column increases its strength and flexibility allowing it to absorb shocks like a spring Figure

Intervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second
cervical vertebra to the sacrum Each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts
as a cushion to absorb shocks from movements such as walking and running Intervertebral discs also act as
ligaments to bind vertebrae together The inner part of discs the nucleus pulposus hardens as people age and
becomes less elastic This loss of elasticity diminishes its ability to absorb shocks
The Thoracic Cage
The thoracic cage also known as the ribcage is the skeleton of the chest and consists of the ribs sternum
thoracic vertebrae and costal cartilages Figure 389 The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of
the thoracic cavity including the heart and lungs It also provides support for the shoulder girdles and upper
limbs and serves as the attachment point for the diaphragm muscles of the back chest neck and shoulders
Changes in the volume of the thorax enable breathing
The sternum or breastbone is a long flat bone located at the anterior of the chest It is formed from three
bones that fuse in the adult The ribs are 12 pairs of long curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and
curve toward the front of the body forming the ribcage Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to
the sternum with the exception of rib pairs 11 and 12 which are freefloating ribs
