Ginkgophytes
The single surviving species of the ginkgophytes group is Ginkgo biloba Figure 2611 Its fanshaped
leavesunique among seed plants because they feature a dichotomous venation patternturn yellow in
autumn and fall from the tree For centuries G biloba was cultivated by Chinese Buddhist monks in monasteries
which ensured its preservation It is planted in public spaces because it is unusually resistant to pollution Male
and female organs are produced on separate plants Typically gardeners plant only male trees because the
seeds produced by the female plant have an offputting smell of rancid butter

fruit of Ginkgo biloba as drawn by Philipp Franz von Siebold and Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini
Gnetophytes
The phylogenetic position of the gnetophytes is not currently resolved Their possession of vessel elements
suggests they are the closest relative to modern angiosperms However molecular analysis places them closer
to the conifers The three living genera are quite dissimilar Ephedra Gnetum and Welwitschia Figure 2612
