includes protein kinases and GTPbinding proteins that are similar to Gproteins
Figure 916 Budding Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells can communicate by releasing a signaling molecule
called mating factor In this micrograph they are visualized using differential interference contrast microscopy a light
microscopy technique that enhances the contrast of the sample
Signaling in Bacteria
Signaling in bacteria enables bacteria to monitor extracellular conditions ensure that there are sufficient
amounts of nutrients and ensure that hazardous situations are avoided There are circumstances however
when bacteria communicate with each other
The first evidence of bacterial communication was observed in a bacterium that has a symbiotic relationship
with Hawaiian bobtail squid When the population density of the bacteria reaches a certain level specific gene
expression is initiated and the bacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light Because the number
of cells present in the environment cell density is the determining factor for signaling bacterial signaling was
named quorum sensing In politics and business a quorum is the minimum number of members required to be
present to vote on an issue
Quorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules Autoinducers are signaling molecules secreted
by bacteria to communicate with other bacteria of the same kind The secreted autoinducers can be small
hydrophobic molecules such as acylhomoserine lactone AHL or larger peptidebased molecules each type
of molecule has a different mode of action When AHL enters target bacteria it binds to transcription factors
which then switch gene expression on or off When the number of bacteria increases so does the concentration
of the autoinducer triggering increased expression of certain genes including autoinducers which results in a
selfamplifying cycle also known as a positive feedback loop Figure 917 The peptide autoinducers stimulate
more complicated signaling pathways that include bacterial kinases The changes in bacteria following exposure
to autoinducers can be quite extensive The pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has 616 different
genes that respond to autoinducers
Some species of bacteria that use quorum sensing form biofilms complex colonies of bacteria often containing
several species that exchange chemical signals to coordinate the release of toxins that will attack the host
Bacterial biofilms Figure 918 can sometimes be found on medical equipment when biofilms invade implants
such as hip or knee replacements or heart pacemakers they can cause lifethreatening infections
