KEY TERMS
type of secondary protein structure formed by folding the polypeptide into a
helix shape with hydrogen bonds stabilizing the structure
a proteins monomer has a central carbon or alpha carbon to which an amino group a carboxyl
group a hydrogen and an R group or side chain is attached the R group is different for all 20 common
amino acids
secondary structure in proteins in which hydrogen bonding forms pleats
between atoms on the polypeptide chains backbone
large molecule necessary for life that is built from smaller organic molecules
biological macromolecule in which the ratio of carbon to hydrogen and to oxygen is 121
carbohydrates serve as energy sources and structural support in cells and form arthropods cellular
exoskeleton
polysaccharide that comprises the plants cell wall provides structural support to the cell
also chaperonin protein that helps nascent protein in the folding process
type of carbohydrate that forms the outer skeleton of all arthropods that include crustaceans and insects
it also forms fungi cell walls
also condensation reaction that links monomer molecules releasing a water
molecule for each bond formed
loss of shape in a protein as a result of changes in temperature pH or chemical exposure
doublehelical molecule that carries the cells hereditary information
two sugar monomers that a glycosidic bond links
catalyst in a biochemical reaction that is usually a complex or conjugated protein
storage carbohydrate in animals
bond formed by a dehydration reaction between two monosaccharides with eliminating a
water molecule
chemical signaling molecule usually protein or steroid secreted by endocrine cells that act to control
or regulate specific physiological processes
reaction that causes breakdown of larger molecules into smaller molecules by utilizing water
macromolecule that is nonpolar and insoluble in water
RNA that carries information from DNA to ribosomes during protein synthesis
smallest unit of larger molecules that are polymers
single unit or monomer of carbohydrates
biological macromolecule that carries the cells genetic blueprint and carries instructions for the
cells functioning
monomer of nucleic acids contains a pentose sugar one or more phosphate groups and a
nitrogenous base
type of polyunsaturated fat that the body requires numbering the carbon omega starts from the
methyl end or the end that is farthest from the carboxylic end
