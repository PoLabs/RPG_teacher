404  Blood Flow and Blood Pressure Regulation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the system of blood flow through the body

Describe how blood pressure is regulated
Blood pressure BP is the pressure exerted by blood on the walls of a blood vessel that helps to push blood
through the body Systolic blood pressure measures the amount of pressure that blood exerts on vessels while
the heart is beating The optimal systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg Diastolic blood pressure measures the
pressure in the vessels between heartbeats The optimal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg Many factors can
affect blood pressure such as hormones stress exercise eating sitting and standing Blood flow through the
body is regulated by the size of blood vessels by the action of smooth muscle by oneway valves and by the
fluid pressure of the blood itself
How Blood Flows Through the Body
Blood is pushed through the body by the action of the pumping heart With each rhythmic pump blood is
pushed under high pressure and velocity away from the heart initially along the main artery the aorta In the
aorta the blood travels at 30 cmsec As blood moves into the arteries arterioles and ultimately to the capillary
beds the rate of movement slows dramatically to about 0026 cmsec onethousand times slower than the
rate of movement in the aorta While the diameter of each individual arteriole and capillary is far narrower than
the diameter of the aorta and according to the law of continuity fluid should travel faster through a narrower
diameter tube the rate is actually slower due to the overall diameter of all the combined capillaries being far
greater than the diameter of the individual aorta
The slow rate of travel through the capillary beds which reach almost every cell in the body assists with gas and
nutrient exchange and also promotes the diffusion of fluid into the interstitial space After the blood has passed
through the capillary beds to the venules veins and finally to the main venae cavae the rate of flow increases
again but is still much slower than the initial rate in the aorta Blood primarily moves in the veins by the rhythmic
movement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and by the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves
Because most veins must move blood against the pull of gravity blood is prevented from flowing backward in
the veins by oneway valves Because skeletal muscle contraction aids in venous blood flow it is important to
get up and move frequently after long periods of sitting so that blood will not pool in the extremities
