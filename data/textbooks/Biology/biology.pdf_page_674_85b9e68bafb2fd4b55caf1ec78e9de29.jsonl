was aerobic because it had mitochondria derived from an aerobic alphaproteobacterium that lived inside a
host cell Whether this host had a nucleus at the time of the initial symbiosis remains unknown The last
common ancestor may have had a cell wall for at least part of its life cycle but more data are needed to
confirm this hypothesis Todays eukaryotes are very diverse in their shapes organization life cycles and
number of cells per individual
232 Characteristics of Protists
Protists are extremely diverse in terms of their biological and ecological characteristics partly because they are
an artificial assemblage of phylogenetically unrelated groups Protists display highly varied cell structures
several types of reproductive strategies virtually every possible type of nutrition and varied habitats Most
singlecelled protists are motile but these organisms use diverse structures for transportation
233 Groups of Protists
The process of classifying protists into meaningful groups is ongoing but genetic data in the past 20 years
have clarified many relationships that were previously unclear or mistaken The majority view at present is to
order all eukaryotes into six supergroups Archaeplastida Amoebozoa Opisthokonta Rhizaria
Chromalveolata and Excavata The goal of this classification scheme is to create clusters of species that all
are derived from a common ancestor At present the monophyly of some of the supergroups are better
supported by genetic data than others Although tremendous variation exists within the supergroups
commonalities at the morphological physiological and ecological levels can be identified
234 Ecology of Protists
Protists function at several levels of the ecological food web as primary producers as direct food sources and
as decomposers In addition many protists are parasites of plants and animals and can cause deadly human
diseases or destroy valuable crops
