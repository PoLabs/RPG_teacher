Pollination by Bats
In the tropics and deserts bats are often the pollinators of nocturnal flowers such as agave guava and morning
glory The flowers are usually large and white or palecolored thus they can be distinguished from the dark
surroundings at night The flowers have a strong fruity or musky fragrance and produce large amounts of nectar
They are naturally large and widemouthed to accommodate the head of the bat As the bats seek the nectar
their faces and heads become covered with pollen which is then transferred to the next flower
Pollination by Birds
Many species of small birds such as the hummingbird Figure 3214 and sun birds are pollinators for plants
such as orchids and other wildflowers Flowers visited by birds are usually sturdy and are oriented in such a way
as to allow the birds to stay near the flower without getting their wings entangled in the nearby flowers The flower
typically has a curved tubular shape which allows access for the birds beak Brightly colored odorless flowers
that are open during the day are pollinated by birds As a bird seeks energyrich nectar pollen is deposited
on the birds head and neck and is then transferred to the next flower it visits Botanists have been known to
determine the range of extinct plants by collecting and identifying pollen from 200yearold bird specimens from
the same site

Pollination by Wind
Most species of conifers and many angiosperms such as grasses maples and oaks are pollinated by wind
Pine cones are brown and unscented while the flowers of windpollinated angiosperm species are usually green
small may have small or no petals and produce large amounts of pollen Unlike the typical insectpollinated
flowers flowers adapted to pollination by wind do not produce nectar or scent In windpollinated species the
microsporangia hang out of the flower and as the wind blows the lightweight pollen is carried with it Figure
3215 The flowers usually emerge early in the spring before the leaves so that the leaves do not block the
movement of the wind The pollen is deposited on the exposed feathery stigma of the flower Figure 3216
