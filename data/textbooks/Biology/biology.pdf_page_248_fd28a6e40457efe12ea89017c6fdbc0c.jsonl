by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet The energy is transferred from chlorophyll to
chlorophyll until eventually after about a millionth of a second it is delivered to the reaction center Up to this
point only energy has been transferred between molecules not electrons
Figure 816 In the photosystem II PSII reaction center energy from sunlight is used to extract electrons from
water The electrons travel through the chloroplast electron transport chain to photosystem I PSI which reduces
NADP to NADPH The electron transport chain moves protons across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen At
the same time splitting of water adds protons to the lumen and reduction of NADPH removes protons from the
stroma The net result is a low pH in the thylakoid lumen and a high pH in the stroma ATP synthase uses this
electrochemical gradient to make ATP
What is the initial source of electrons for the chloroplast electron transport chain
a
water
b
oxygen
c
carbon dioxide
d
NADPH
The reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property Those two chlorophylls
can undergo oxidation upon excitation they can actually give up an electron in a process called a photoact It
is at this step in the reaction center during photosynthesis that light energy is converted into an excited electron
All of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin
cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for longterm storage in the form of a carbohydrate PSII
and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain which also includes the
cytochrome complex The cytochrome complex an enzyme composed of two protein complexes transfers the
electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone Pq to the protein plastocyanin Pc thus enabling both the
transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to PSI
The reaction center of PSII called P680 delivers its highenergy electrons one at the time to the primary
electron acceptor and through the electron transport chain Pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine to
PSI P680s missing electron is replaced by extracting a lowenergy electron from water thus water is split
during this stage of photosynthesis and PSII is rereduced after every photoact Splitting one H2O molecule
releases two electrons two hydrogen atoms and one atom of oxygen However splitting two molecules is
