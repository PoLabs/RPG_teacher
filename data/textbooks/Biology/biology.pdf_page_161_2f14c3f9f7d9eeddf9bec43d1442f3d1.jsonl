Immunologist
The variations in peripheral proteins and carbohydrates that affect a cells recognition sites are of prime
interest in immunology In developing vaccines researchers have been able to conquer many infectious
diseases such as smallpox polio diphtheria and tetanus
Immunologists are the physicians and scientists who research and develop vaccines as well as treat and
study allergies or other immune problems Some immunologists study and treat autoimmune problems
diseases in which a persons immune system attacks his or her own cells or tissues such as lupus
and immunodeficiencies whether acquired such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS or
hereditary such as severe combined immunodeficiency or SCID Immunologists also help treat organ
transplantation patients who must have their immune systems suppressed so that their bodies will not
reject a transplanted organ Some immunologists work to understand natural immunity and the effects of a
persons environment on it Others work on questions about how the immune system affects diseases such
as cancer In the past researchers did not understand the importance of having a healthy immune system
in preventing cancer
To work as an immunologist one must have a PhD or MD In addition immunologists undertake at least
two to three years of training in an accredited program and must pass the American Board of Allergy
and Immunology exam Immunologists must possess knowledge of the human bodys function as they
relate to issues beyond immunization and knowledge of pharmacology and medical technology such as
medications therapies test materials and surgical procedures
52  Passive Transport
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain why and how passive transport occurs

Understand the osmosis and diffusion processes

Define tonicity and its relevance to passive transport
Plasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell and prevent some harmful materials
from entering and some essential materials from leaving In other words plasma membranes are selectively
permeablethey allow some substances to pass through but not others If they were to lose this selectivity
the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself and it would be destroyed Some cells require larger amounts
of specific substances They must have a way of obtaining these materials from extracellular fluids This may
happen passively as certain materials move back and forth or the cell may have special mechanisms that
facilitate transport Some materials are so important to a cell that it spends some of its energy hydrolyzing
adenosine triphosphate ATP to obtain these materials Red blood cells use some of their energy doing just
that Most cells spend the majority of their energy to maintain an imbalance of sodium and potassium ions
between the cells interior and exterior as well as on protein synthesis
The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive Passive transport is a naturally occurring
phenomenon and does not require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement In passive
transport substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration A physical
space in which there is a single substance concentration range has a concentration gradient
Selective Permeability
Plasma membranes are asymmetric the membranes interior is not identical to its exterior There is a
considerable difference between the array of phospholipids and proteins between the two leaflets that form a
membrane On the membranes interior some proteins serve to anchor the membrane to cytoskeletons fibers
There are peripheral proteins on the membranes exterior that bind extracellular matrix elements Carbohydrates
