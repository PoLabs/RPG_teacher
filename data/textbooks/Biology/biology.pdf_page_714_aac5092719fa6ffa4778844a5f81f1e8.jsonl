Figure 252 Alternation of generations between the 1n gametophyte and 2n sporophyte is shown Mitosis occurs in
both gametophyte and sporophyte generations Diploid sporophytes produce haploid spores by meiosis while haploid
gametophytes produce gametes by mitosis credit Peter Coxhead
In alternation of generations the multicellular haploid form known as a gametophyte is followed in the
developmental sequence by a multicellular diploid form the sporophyte The gametophyte gives rise to the
gametes reproductive cells by mitosis This can be the most obvious phase of the life cycle of the plant as in
the mosses or it can occur in a microscopic structure such as a pollen grain in the seed plants The evolution
of the land plants is marked by increasing prominence of the sporophyte generation The sporophyte stage
is barely noticeable in nonvascular plants the collective term for the plants that include the liverworts and
mosses In the seed plants the sporophyte phase can be a towering tree as in sequoias and pines
Protection of the embryo is a major requirement for land plants The vulnerable embryo must be sheltered
from desiccation and other environmental hazards In both seedless and seed plants the female gametophyte
provides protection and nutrients to the embryo as it develops into the new sporophyte This distinguishing
feature of land plants gave the group its alternate name of embryophytes
Sporangia in Seedless Plants
The sporophyte of seedless plants is diploid and results from syngamy fusion of two gametes The sporophyte
bears the sporangia singular sporangium The term sporangia literally means a vessel for spores as it
is a reproductive sac in which spores are formed Figure 253 Inside the multicellular sporangia the diploid
sporocytes or mother cells produce haploid spores by meiosis during which the 2n chromosome number is
reduced to 1n note that in many plants chromosome number is complicated by polyploidy for example durum
wheat is tetraploid bread wheat is hexaploid and some ferns are 1000ploid The spores are later released by
the sporangia and disperse in the environment When the haploid spore germinates in a hospitable environment
it generates a multicellular gametophyte by mitosis The gametophyte supports the zygote formed from the
fusion of gametes and the resulting young sporophyte vegetative form The cycle then begins anew
Figure 253 Sporangia Sporeproducing sacs called sporangia grow at the ends of long thin stalks in this photo of the
moss Esporangios bryum credit Javier Martin
Plants that produce only one type of spore are called homosporous and the resultant gametophyte produces
both male and female gametes usually on the same individual Nonvascular plants are homosporous and the
gametophyte is the dominant generation in the life cycle Plants that produce two types of spores are called
