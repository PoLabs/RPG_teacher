Figure 2717 Trilobites These fossils ad belong to trilobites extinct arthropods that appeared in the early Cambrian
period 525 million years ago and disappeared from the fossil record during a mass extinction at the end of the
Permian period about 250 million years ago
The cause of the Cambrian explosion is still debated and in fact it may be that a number of interacting causes
ushered in this incredible explosion of animal diversity For this reason there are a number of hypotheses
that attempt to answer this question Environmental changes may have created a more suitable environment
for animal life Examples of these changes include rising atmospheric oxygen levels Figure 2718 and large
increases in oceanic calcium concentrations that preceded the Cambrian period Some scientists believe that
an expansive continental shelf with numerous shallow lagoons or pools provided the necessary living space
for larger numbers of different types of animals to coexist There is also support for hypotheses that argue that
ecological relationships between species such as changes in the food web competition for food and space
and predatorprey relationships were primed to promote a sudden massive coevolution of species Yet other
hypotheses claim genetic and developmental reasons for the Cambrian explosion The morphological flexibility
and complexity of animal development afforded by the evolution of Hox control genes may have provided the
necessary opportunities for increases in possible animal morphologies at the time of the Cambrian period
Hypotheses that attempt to explain why the Cambrian explosion happened must be able to provide valid reasons
for the massive animal diversification as well as explain why it happened when it did There is evidence that both
supports and refutes each of the hypotheses described above and the answer may very well be a combination
of these and other theories
