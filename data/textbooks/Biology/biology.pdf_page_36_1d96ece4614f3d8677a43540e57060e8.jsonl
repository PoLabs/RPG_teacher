Carl Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree
In the past biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms animals plants fungi protists and
bacteria They based the organizational scheme mainly on physical features as opposed to physiology
biochemistry or molecular biology all of which modern systematics use American microbiologist Carl
Woeses pioneering work in the early 1970s has shown however that life on Earth has evolved along three
lineages now called domainsBacteria Archaea and Eukarya The first two are prokaryotic cells with
microbes that lack membraneenclosed nuclei and organelles The third domain contains the eukaryotes
and includes unicellular microorganisms protists together with the three remaining kingdoms fungi
plants and animals Woese defined Archaea as a new domain and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree
Figure 117 Many organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are
called extremophiles To construct his tree Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based
on morphology shape
Woese constructed his tree from universally distributed comparative gene sequencing that are present
in every organism and conserved meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged
throughout evolution Woeses approach was revolutionary because comparing physical features are
insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly similar in spite of their tremendous
biochemical diversity and genetic variability Figure 118 Comparing homologous DNA and RNA
sequences provided Woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes
and which justified separating the prokaryotes into two domains bacteria and archaea
Figure 118 These images represent different domains The a bacteria in this micrograph belong to Domain
Bacteria while the b extremophiles not visible living in this hot vent belong to Domain Archaea Both the
c sunflower and d lion are part of Domain Eukarya credit a modification of work by Drew March credit b
