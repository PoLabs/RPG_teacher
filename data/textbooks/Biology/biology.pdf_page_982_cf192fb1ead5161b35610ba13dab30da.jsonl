The life cycle of higher plants is dominated by the sporophyte stage with the gametophyte borne on the
sporophyte In ferns the gametophyte is freeliving and very distinct in structure from the diploid sporophyte In
bryophytes such as mosses the haploid gametophyte is more developed than the sporophyte
During the vegetative phase of growth plants increase in size and produce a shoot system and a root system
As they enter the reproductive phase some of the branches start to bear flowers Many flowers are borne singly
whereas some are borne in clusters The flower is borne on a stalk known as a receptacle Flower shape color
and size are unique to each species and are often used by taxonomists to classify plants
Sexual Reproduction in Angiosperms
The lifecycle of angiosperms follows the alternation of generations explained previously The haploid
gametophyte alternates with the diploid sporophyte during the sexual reproduction process of angiosperms
Flowers contain the plants reproductive structures
Flower Structure
A typical flower has four main partsor whorlsknown as the calyx corolla androecium and gynoecium
Figure 323 The outermost whorl of the flower has green leafy structures known as sepals The sepals
collectively called the calyx help to protect the unopened bud The second whorl is comprised of petalsusually
brightly coloredcollectively called the corolla The number of sepals and petals varies depending on whether
the plant is a monocot or dicot In monocots petals usually number three or multiples of three in dicots the
number of petals is four or five or multiples of four and five Together the calyx and corolla are known as
the perianth The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium The
androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia The innermost group of structures in
the flower is the gynoecium or the female reproductive components The carpel is the individual unit of the
gynoecium and has a stigma style and ovary A flower may have one or multiple carpels
