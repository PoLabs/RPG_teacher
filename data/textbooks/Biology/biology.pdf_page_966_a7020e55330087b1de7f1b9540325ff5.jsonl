from the weathering of rocks and are primarily composed of inorganic material are called mineral soils Mineral
soils are predominant in terrestrial ecosystems where soils may be covered by water for part of the year or
exposed to the atmosphere
Soil Composition
Soil consists of these major components Figure 316

inorganic mineral matter about 40 to 45 percent of the soil volume

organic matter about 5 percent of the soil volume

water and air about 50 percent of the soil volume
The amount of each of the four major components of soil depends on the amount of vegetation soil compaction
and water present in the soil A good healthy soil has sufficient air water minerals and organic material to
promote and sustain plant life
Figure 316 The four major components of soil are shown inorganic minerals organic matter water and air
Soil compaction can result when soil is compressed by heavy machinery or even foot traffic How might this
compaction change the soil composition
The organic material of soil called humus is made up of microorganisms dead and alive and dead animals
and plants in varying stages of decay Humus improves soil structure and provides plants with water and
minerals The inorganic material of soil consists of rock slowly broken down into smaller particles that vary in
size Soil particles that are 01 to 2 mm in diameter are sand Soil particles between 0002 and 01 mm are called
silt and even smaller particles less than 0002 mm in diameter are called clay Some soils have no dominant
particle size and contain a mixture of sand silt and humus these soils are called loams
