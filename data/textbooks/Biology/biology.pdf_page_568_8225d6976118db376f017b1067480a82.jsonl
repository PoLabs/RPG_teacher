CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
16 How does a phylogenetic tree relate to the
passing of time
17 Some organisms that appear very closely related
on a phylogenetic tree may not actually be closely
related Why is this
18 List the different levels of the taxonomic
classification system
19 Dolphins and fish have similar body shapes Is
this feature more likely a homologous or analogous
trait
20 Why is it so important for scientists to distinguish
between homologous and analogous characteristics
before building phylogenetic trees
21 Describe maximum parsimony
22 Compare three different ways that eukaryotic
cells may have evolved
23 Describe how aphids acquired the ability to
change color
