genes later in life while rats with inattentive mothers
had high activation of stressresponse genes in the
same situation An additional study that swapped the
pups at birth ie rats born to inattentive mothers
grew up with attentive mothers and vice versa
showed the same positive effect of attentive
mothering How do genetics andor epigenetics
explain the results of this study
29 Some autoimmune diseases show a positive
correlation with dramatically decreased expression of
histone deacetylase 9 HDAC9 an enzyme that
removes acetyl groups from histones Why would
the decreased expression of HDAC9 cause immune
cells to produce inflammatory genes at inappropriate
times
30 A mutation within the promoter region can alter
transcription of a gene Describe how this can
happen
31 What could happen if a cell had too much of an
activating transcription factor present
32 A scientist identifies a potential transcription
regulation site 300bp downstream of a gene and
hypothesizes that it is a repressor What experiment
with results could he perform to support this
hypothesis
33 Describe how RBPs can prevent miRNAs from
degrading an RNA molecule
34 How can external stimuli alter posttranscriptional
control of gene expression
35 Protein modification can alter gene expression in
many ways Describe how phosphorylation of
proteins can alter gene expression
36 Alternative forms of a protein can be beneficial or
harmful to a cell What do you think would happen if
too much of an alternative protein bound to the 3
UTR of an RNA and caused it to degrade
37 Changes in epigenetic modifications alter the
accessibility and transcription of DNA Describe how
environmental stimuli such as ultraviolet light
exposure could modify gene expression
38 A scientist discovers a virus encoding a Protein X
that degrades a subunit of the eIF4F complex
Knowing that this virus transcribes its own mRNAs in
the cytoplasm of human cells why would Protein X
be an effective virulence factor
39 New drugs are being developed that decrease
DNA methylation and prevent the removal of acetyl
groups from histone proteins Explain how these
drugs could affect gene expression to help kill tumor
cells
40 How can understanding the gene expression
pattern in a cancer cell tell you something about that
specific form of cancer
