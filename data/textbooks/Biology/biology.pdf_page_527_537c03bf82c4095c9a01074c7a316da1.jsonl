Introduction
All life on Earth is related Evolutionary theory states that humans beetles plants and bacteria all share
a common ancestor but that millions of years of evolution have shaped each of these organisms into the
forms we see today Scientists consider evolution a key concept to understanding life It is one of the most
dominant evolutionary forces Natural selection acts to promote traits and behaviors that increase an organisms
chances of survival and reproduction while eliminating those traits and behaviors that are detrimental to the
organism However natural selection can only as its name implies selectit cannot create We can attribute
novel traits and behaviors to another evolutionary forcemutation Mutation and other sources of variation
among individuals as well as the evolutionary forces that act upon them alter populations and species This
combination of processes has led to the world of life we see today
