15  GENES AND
PROTEINS
Figure 151 Genes which are carried on a chromosomes are linearly organized instructions for making the RNA
and protein molecules that are necessary for all of the processes of life The b interleukin2 protein and c alpha2u
globulin protein are just two examples of the array of different molecular structures that are encoded by genes credit

Introduction
Since the rediscovery of Mendels work in 1900 the definition of the gene has progressed from an abstract unit
of heredity to a tangible molecular entity capable of replication expression and mutation Figure 151 Genes
are composed of DNA and are linearly arranged on chromosomes Genes specify the sequences of amino acids
which are the building blocks of proteins In turn proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every function
of the cell Both genes and the proteins they encode are absolutely essential to life as we know it
151  The Genetic Code
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain the central dogma of DNAprotein synthesis

Describe the genetic code and how the nucleotide sequence prescribes the amino acid and the protein
sequence
The cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA mRNA a mobile molecular copy of one or
more genes with an alphabet of A C G and uracil U Translation of the mRNA template on ribosomes converts
nucleotidebased genetic information into a protein product That is the central dogma of DNAprotein synthesis
