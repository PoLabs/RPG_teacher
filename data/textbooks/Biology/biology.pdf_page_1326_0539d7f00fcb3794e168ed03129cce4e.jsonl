Figure 4215 The topology and function of intestinal MALT is shown Pathogens are taken up by M cells in the intestinal
epithelium and excreted into a pocket formed by the inner surface of the cell The pocket contains antigenpresenting
cells such as dendritic cells which engulf the antigens then present them with MHC II molecules on the cell surface
The dendritic cells migrate to an underlying tissue called a Peyers patch Antigenpresenting cells T cells and B cells
aggregate within the Peyers patch forming organized lymphoid follicles There some T cells and B cells are activated
Other antigenloaded dendritic cells migrate through the lymphatic system where they activate B cells T cells and
plasma cells in the lymph nodes The activated cells then return to MALT tissue effector sites IgA and other antibodies
are secreted into the intestinal lumen
MALT is a crucial component of a functional immune system because mucosal surfaces such as the nasal
passages are the first tissues onto which inhaled or ingested pathogens are deposited The mucosal tissue
includes the mouth pharynx and esophagus and the gastrointestinal respiratory and urogenital tracts
The immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful unnecessary responses to harmless substances
and more importantly so that it does not attack self The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or
harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune
tolerance Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number
of foreign substances such as food proteins that APCs of the oral cavity pharynx and gastrointestinal
mucosa encounter Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs in the liver lymph nodes small
intestine and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of regulatory T
Treg cells specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory
immune factors The combined result of Treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in
undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead In addition to
promoting immune tolerance of harmless antigens other subsets of Treg cells are involved in the prevention of
the autoimmune response which is an inappropriate immune response to host cells or selfantigens Another
Treg class suppresses immune responses to harmful pathogens after the infection has cleared to minimize host
cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis
