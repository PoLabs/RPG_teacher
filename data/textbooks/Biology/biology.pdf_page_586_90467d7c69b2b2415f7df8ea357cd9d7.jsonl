Vaccines and Antiviral Drugs for Treatment
In some cases vaccines can be used to treat an active viral infection The concept behind this is that by giving
the vaccine immunity is boosted without adding more diseasecausing virus In the case of rabies a fatal
neurological disease transmitted via the saliva of rabies virusinfected animals the progression of the disease
from the time of the animal bite to the time it enters the central nervous system may be two weeks or longer
This is enough time to vaccinate individuals who suspect that they have been bitten by a rabid animal and their
boosted immune response is sufficient to prevent the virus from entering nervous tissue Thus the potentially
fatal neurological consequences of the disease are averted and the individual only has to recover from the
infected bite This approach is also being used for the treatment of Ebola one of the fastest and most deadly
viruses on Earth Transmitted by bats and great apes this disease can cause death in 70 to 90 percent of
infected humans within two weeks Using newly developed vaccines that boost the immune response in this
way there is hope that affected individuals will be better able to control the virus potentially saving a greater
percentage of infected persons from a rapid and very painful death
Another way of treating viral infections is the use of antiviral drugs Because viruses use the resources of the
host cell for replication and the production of new virus proteins it is difficult to block their activities without
damaging the host However we do have some effective antiviral drugs such as those used to treat HIV and
influenza Some antiviral drugs are specific for a particular virus and others have been used to control and
reduce symptoms for a wide variety of viral diseases For most viruses these drugs can inhibit the virus by
blocking the actions of one or more of its proteins It is important to note that the targeted proteins be encoded
by viral genes and that these molecules are not present in a healthy host cell In this way viral growth is inhibited
without damaging the host
