Introduction
Cucurbitaceae is a family of plants first cultivated in Mesoamerica although several species are native to North
America The family includes many edible species such as squash and pumpkin as well as inedible gourds In
order to grow and develop into mature fruitbearing plants many requirements must be met and events must
be coordinated Seeds must germinate under the right conditions in the soil therefore temperature moisture
and soil quality are important factors that play a role in germination and seedling development Soil quality and
climate are significant to plant distribution and growth The young seedling will eventually grow into a mature
plant and the roots will absorb nutrients and water from the soil At the same time the aboveground parts
of the plant will absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use energy from sunlight to produce organic
compounds through photosynthesis This chapter will explore the complex dynamics between plants and soils
and the adaptations that plants have evolved to make better use of nutritional resources
311  Nutritional Requirements of Plants
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how plants obtain nutrients

List the elements and compounds required for proper plant nutrition

Describe an essential nutrient
Plants are unique organisms that can absorb nutrients and water through their root system as well as carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere Soil quality and climate are the major determinants of plant distribution and growth
