of any animal Sharks together with most fishes and aquatic and larval amphibians also have a row of sensory
structures called the lateral line which is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water and
is often considered to be functionally similar to the sense of hearing in terrestrial vertebrates The lateral line is
visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of a fishs body Sharks have no mechanism for maintaining
neutral buoyancy and must swim continuously to stay suspended in the water Some must also swim in order to
ventilate their gills but others have muscular pumps in their mouths to keep water flowing over the gills

Sharks reproduce sexually and eggs are fertilized internally Most species are ovoviviparous The fertilized egg
is retained in the oviduct of the mothers body and the embryo is nourished by the egg yolk The eggs hatch
in the uterus and young are born alive and fully functional Some species of sharks are oviparous They lay
eggs that hatch outside of the mothers body Embryos are protected by a shark egg case or mermaids purse
Figure 2914 that has the consistency of leather The shark egg case has tentacles that snag in seaweed and
give the newborn shark cover A few species of sharks eg tiger sharks and hammerheads are viviparous the
yolk sac that initially contains the egg yolk and transfers its nutrients to the growing embryo becomes attached
to the oviduct of the female and nutrients are transferred directly from the mother to the growing embryo In both
viviparous and ovoviviparous sharks gas exchange uses this yolk sac transport

structure is the yolk that nourishes the growing embryo credit Jek Bacarisas
In general the Chondrichthyes have a fusiform or dorsoventrally flattened body a heterocercal caudal fin or tail
unequally sized fin lobes with the tail vertebrae extending into the larger upper lobe paired pectoral and pelvic
fins in males these may be modified as claspers exposed gill slits elasmobranch and an intestine with a
spiral valve that condenses the length of the intestine They also have three pairs of semicircular canals and
excellent senses of smell vibration vision and electroreception A very large lobed liver produces squalene oil
a lightweight biochemical precursor to steroids that serves to aid in buoyancy because with a specific gravity
of 0855 it is lighter than that of water
