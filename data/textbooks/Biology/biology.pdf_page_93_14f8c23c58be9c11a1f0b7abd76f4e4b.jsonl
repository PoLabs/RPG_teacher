Figure 316 Saturated fatty acids have hydrocarbon chains connected by single bonds only Unsaturated fatty acids
have one or more double bonds Each double bond may be in a cis or trans configuration In the cis configuration both
hydrogens are on the same side of the hydrocarbon chain In the trans configuration the hydrogens are on opposite
sides A cis double bond causes a kink in the chain
Trans Fats
The food industry artificially hydrogenates oils to make them semisolid and of a consistency desirable for many
processed food products Simply speaking hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them During this
hydrogenation process double bonds of the cis conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may convert to double
bonds in the trans conformation
Margarine some types of peanut butter and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenated trans fats
Recent studies have shown that an increase in trans fats in the human diet may lead to higher levels of low
density lipoproteins LDL or bad cholesterol which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries
resulting in heart disease Many fast food restaurants have recently banned using trans fats and food labels are
required to display the trans fat content
Omega Fatty Acids
Essential fatty acids are those that the human body requires but does not synthesize Consequently they have
to be supplemented through ingestion via the diet Omega3 fatty acids like those in Figure 317 fall into this
category and are one of only two known for humans the other is omega6 fatty acid These are polyunsaturated
fatty acids and are omega3 because a double bond connects the third carbon from the hydrocarbon chains end
to its neighboring carbon
