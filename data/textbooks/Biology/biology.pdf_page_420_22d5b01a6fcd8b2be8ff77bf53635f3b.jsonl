43 which is far more than the number of amino acids Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by
nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate In other words a given amino acid could be
encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet This was later confirmed experimentally Francis Crick and Sydney
Brenner used the chemical mutagen proflavin to insert one two or three nucleotides into the gene of a virus
When one or two nucleotides were inserted the normal proteins were not produced When three nucleotides
were inserted the protein was synthesized and functional This demonstrated that the amino acids must be
specified by groups of three nucleotides These nucleotide triplets are called codons The insertion of one or two
nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame thereby altering the message for every subsequent
amino acid Figure 155 Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during
translation the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained
Scientists painstakingly solved the genetic code by translating synthetic mRNAs in vitro and sequencing the
proteins they specified Figure 154
Figure 154 This figure shows the genetic code for translating each nucleotide triplet in mRNA into an amino acid or a
termination signal in a protein credit modification of work by NIH
In addition to codons that instruct the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain three of the 64
codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery These triplets
are called nonsense codons or stop codons Another codon AUG also has a special function In addition to
specifying the amino acid methionine it also serves as the start codon to initiate translation The reading frame
for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5 end of the mRNA Following the start codon the mRNA
is read in groups of three until a stop codon is encountered
The arrangement of the coding table reveals the structure of the code There are sixteen blocks of codons
each specified by the first and second nucleotides of the codons within the block eg the AC block that
corresponds to the amino acid threonine Thr Some blocks are divided into a pyrimidine half in which the codon
ends with U or C and a purine half in which the codon ends with A or G Some amino acids get a whole block
of four codons like alanine Ala threonine Thr and proline Pro Some get the pyrimidine half of their block
like histidine His and asparagine Asn Others get the purine half of their block like glutamate Glu and lysine
Lys Note that some amino acids get a block and a halfblock for a total of six codons
