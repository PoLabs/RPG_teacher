Figure 813 a Chlorophyll a b chlorophyll b and c carotene are hydrophobic organic pigments found in
the thylakoid membrane Chlorophyll a and b which are identical except for the part indicated in the red box are
responsible for the green color of leaves carotene is responsible for the orange color in carrots Each pigment has
d a unique absorbance spectrum
Many photosynthetic organisms have a mixture of pigments and by using these pigments the organism can
absorb energy from a wider range of wavelengths Not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight
Some organisms grow underwater where light intensity and quality decrease and change with depth Other
organisms grow in competition for light Plants on the rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that
comes through because the taller trees absorb most of the sunlight and scatter the remaining solar radiation

When studying a photosynthetic organism scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating
absorption spectra An instrument called a spectrophotometer can differentiate which wavelengths of light a
substance can absorb Spectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption By
extracting pigments from leaves and placing these samples into a spectrophotometer scientists can identify
which wavelengths of light an organism can absorb Additional methods for the identification of plant pigments
include various types of chromatography that separate the pigments by their relative affinities to solid and mobile
phases
