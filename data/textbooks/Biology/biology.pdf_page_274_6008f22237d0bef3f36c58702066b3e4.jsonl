cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously remove it by using adenosine5
triphosphate ATP For signaling purposes Ca2 is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles such as the endoplasmic
reticulum or accessed from outside the cell When signaling occurs ligandgated calcium ion channels allow
the higher levels of Ca2 that are present outside the cell or in intracellular storage compartments to flow into
the cytoplasm which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2 The response to the increase in Ca2 varies
and depends on the cell type involved For example in the cells of the pancreas Ca2 signaling leads to the
release of insulin and in muscle cells an increase in Ca2 leads to muscle contractions
Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP cAMP Cyclic AMP is
synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP Figure 912 The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to
and activate an enzyme called cAMPdependent kinase Akinase Akinase regulates many vital metabolic
pathways It phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins activating them in the process
Akinase is found in many different types of cells and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different
Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to cAMP in different cells
Figure 912 This diagram shows the mechanism for the formation of cyclic AMP cAMP cAMP serves as a second
messenger to activate or inactivate proteins within the cell Termination of the signal occurs when an enzyme called
phosphodiesterase converts cAMP into AMP
Present in small concentrations in the plasma membrane inositol phospholipids are lipids that can also be
converted into second messengers Because these molecules are membrane components they are located
near membranebound receptors and can easily interact with them Phosphatidylinositol PI is the main
phospholipid that plays a role in cellular signaling Enzymes known as kinases phosphorylate PI to form PI
phosphate PIP and PIbisphosphate PIP2
The enzyme phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 to form diacylglycerol DAG and inositol triphosphate IP3
Figure 913 These products of the cleavage of PIP2 serve as second messengers Diacylglycerol DAG
remains in the plasma membrane and activates protein kinase C PKC which then phosphorylates serine
and threonine residues in its target proteins IP3 diffuses into the cytoplasm and binds to ligandgated calcium
channels in the endoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2 that continues the signal cascade
