411  Osmoregulation and Osmotic Balance
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Define osmosis and explain its role within molecules

Explain why osmoregulation and osmotic balance are important body functions

Describe active transport mechanisms

Explain osmolarity and the way in which it is measured

Describe osmoregulators or osmoconformers and how these tools allow animals to adapt to different
environments
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance
of molecules on either side of the membrane Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water
balance  osmotic balance across membranes within the bodys fluids which are composed of water plus
electrolytes and nonelectrolytes An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water
A nonelectrolyte in contrast doesnt dissociate into ions during water dissolution Both electrolytes and non
electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance The bodys fluids include blood plasma the cytosol within cells
and interstitial fluid the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body The membranes of
the body such as the pleural serous and cell membranes are semipermeable membranes Semipermeable
membranes are permeable or permissive to certain types of solutes and water Solutions on two sides of a
semipermeable membrane tend to equalize in solute concentration by movement of solutes andor water across
the membrane As seen in Figure 412 a cell placed in water tends to swell due to gain of water from the
hypotonic or low salt environment A cell placed in a solution with higher salt concentration on the other hand
tends to make the membrane shrivel up due to loss of water into the hypertonic or high salt environment
Isotonic cells have an equal concentration of solutes inside and outside the cell this equalizes the osmotic
pressure on either side of the cell membrane which is a semipermeable membrane
Figure 412 Cells placed in a hypertonic environment tend to shrink due to loss of water In a hypotonic environment
cells tend to swell due to intake of water The blood maintains an isotonic environment so that cells neither shrink nor
swell credit Mariana Ruiz Villareal
The body does not exist in isolation There is a constant input of water and electrolytes into the system While
osmoregulation is achieved across membranes within the body excess electrolytes and wastes are transported
to the kidneys and excreted helping to maintain osmotic balance
