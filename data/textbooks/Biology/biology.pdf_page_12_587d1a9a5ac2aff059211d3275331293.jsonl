significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their
courses Specific surveys focus groups and prerevision reviews as well as data from our OpenStax Tutor
users all aided in planning the revision
The result is a book that thoroughly treats biologys foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful
coverage in specific areas Biology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw
learners into the discipline
Structurally the textbook remains similar to the first edition with no chapter reorganization and very targeted
changes at the section level mostly in biodiversity
Unit 1 The Chemistry of Life Our opening unit introduces students to the sciences including the scientific
method and the fundamental concepts of chemistry and physics that provide a framework within which
learners comprehend biological processes
Unit 2 The Cell Students will gain solid understanding of the structures functions and processes of the
most basic unit of life the cell
Unit 3 Genetics Our comprehensive genetics unit takes learners from the earliest experiments that
revealed the basis of genetics through the intricacies of DNA to current applications in the emerging studies
of biotechnology and genomics
Unit 4 Evolutionary Processes The core concepts of evolution are discussed in this unit with examples
illustrating evolutionary processes Additionally the evolutionary basis of biology reappears throughout
the textbook in general discussion and is reinforced through special callout features highlighting specific
evolutionbased topics
Unit 5 Biological Diversity The diversity of life is explored with detailed study of various organisms and
discussion of emerging phylogenetic relationships This unit moves from viruses to living organisms like
bacteria discusses the organisms formerly grouped as protists and devotes multiple chapters to plant and
animal life
Unit 6 Plant Structure and Function Our plant unit thoroughly covers the fundamental knowledge of
plant life essential to an introductory biology course
Unit 7 Animal Structure and Function An introduction to the form and function of the animal body
is followed by chapters on specific body systems and processes This unit touches on the biology of all
organisms while maintaining an engaging focus on human anatomy and physiology that helps students
connect to the topics
Unit 8 Ecology Ecological concepts are broadly covered in this unit with features highlighting localized
realworld issues of conservation and biodiversity
Changes to the Second Edition
OpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary In the case
of Biology 2e user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas which we have done in the
following ways
Content revisions for clarity accuracy and currency The revision plan varied by chapter based on
need About twenty chapters were wholly revised with significant updates to conceptual coverage research
informed data and clearer language In about fifteen other chapters the revisions focused mostly on
readability and clearer language with fewer conceptual and factual changes
Additional endofchapter questions The authors added new assessments to nearly every chapter
including both review and critical thinking questions The additions total over 350 new items
Art and illustrations Under the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators especially those
well versed in creating accessible art the OpenStax team made changes to most of the art in Biology You
will find examples in the section below The revisions fall into the following categories
Revisions for accuracy
Redesigns for greater understanding and impact
Recoloring art for overall consistency
Accessibility improvements As with all OpenStax books the first edition of Biology was created with a
focus on accessibility We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition
