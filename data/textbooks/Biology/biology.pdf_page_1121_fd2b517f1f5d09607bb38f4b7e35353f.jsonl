Figure 362 a Mechanosensitive ion channels are gated ion channels that respond to mechanical deformation of the
plasma membrane A mechanosensitive channel is connected to the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton by hair
like tethers When pressure causes the extracellular matrix to move the channel opens allowing ions to enter or exit
the cell b Stereocilia in the human ear are connected to mechanosensitive ion channels When a sound causes the
stereocilia to move mechanosensitive ion channels transduce the signal to the cochlear nerve
Sensory receptors for different senses are very different from each other and they are specialized according
to the type of stimulus they sense they have receptor specificity For example touch receptors light receptors
and sound receptors are each activated by different stimuli Touch receptors are not sensitive to light or sound
they are sensitive only to touch or pressure However stimuli may be combined at higher levels in the brain as
happens with olfaction contributing to our sense of taste
Encoding and Transmission of Sensory Information
Four aspects of sensory information are encoded by sensory systems the type of stimulus the location of the
stimulus in the receptive field the duration of the stimulus and the relative intensity of the stimulus Thus action
potentials transmitted over a sensory receptors afferent axons encode one type of stimulus and this segregation
of the senses is preserved in other sensory circuits For example auditory receptors transmit signals over their
own dedicated system and electrical activity in the axons of the auditory receptors will be interpreted by the
brain as an auditory stimulusa sound
The intensity of a stimulus is often encoded in the rate of action potentials produced by the sensory receptor
Thus an intense stimulus will produce a more rapid train of action potentials and reducing the stimulus will
likewise slow the rate of production of action potentials A second way in which intensity is encoded is by the
number of receptors activated An intense stimulus might initiate action potentials in a large number of adjacent
receptors while a less intense stimulus might stimulate fewer receptors Integration of sensory information
begins as soon as the information is received in the CNS and the brain will further process incoming signals
