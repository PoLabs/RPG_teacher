In other cases individuals may appear similar although they are not members of the same species For example
even though bald eagles Haliaeetus leucocephalus and African fish eagles Haliaeetus vocifer are both birds
and eagles each belongs to a separate species group Figure 1810 If humans were to artificially intervene
and fertilize a bald eagles egg with an African fish eagles sperm and a chick did hatch that offspring called
a hybrid a cross between two species would probably be infertileunable to successfully reproduce after it
reached maturity Different species may have different genes that are active in development therefore it may
not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions Thus even though hybridization
may take place the two species still remain separate

Service
Populations of species share a gene pool a collection of all the gene variants in the species Again the
basis to any changes in a group or population of organisms must be genetic for this is the only way to share
and pass on traits When variations occur within a species they can only pass to the next generation along
two main pathways asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction The change will pass on asexually simply if
the reproducing cell possesses the changed trait For the changed trait to pass on by sexual reproduction a
gamete such as a sperm or egg cell must possess the changed trait In other words sexuallyreproducing
organisms can experience several genetic changes in their body cells but if these changes do not occur in
a sperm or egg cell the changed trait will never reach the next generation Only heritable traits can evolve
Therefore reproduction plays a paramount role for genetic change to take root in a population or species In
short organisms must be able to reproduce with each other to pass new traits to offspring
Speciation
The biological definition of species which works for sexually reproducing organisms is a group of actual or
potential interbreeding individuals There are exceptions to this rule Many species are similar enough that hybrid
offspring are possible and may often occur in nature but for the majority of species this rule generally holds The
presence in nature of hybrids between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single
interbreeding species and the speciation process may not yet be completed
Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation the formation
of two species from one original species Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed
