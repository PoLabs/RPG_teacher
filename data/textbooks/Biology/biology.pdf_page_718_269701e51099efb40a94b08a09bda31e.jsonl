chambers at the center of a flower the walls of the chamber later develop into a fruit
Figure 256 Streptophytes This table shows the major divisions of green plants
Which of the following statements about plant divisions is false
a
Lycophytes and pterophytes are seedless vascular plants
b
All vascular plants produce seeds
c
All nonvascular embryophytes are bryophytes
d

252  Green Algae Precursors of Land Plants
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the traits shared by green algae and land plants

Explain why charophytes are considered the closest algal relative to land plants

Explain how current phylogenetic relationships are reshaped by comparative analysis of DNA
sequences
Streptophytes
Until recently all photosynthetic eukaryotes were classified as members of the kingdom Plantae The brown
and golden algae however are now reassigned to the protist supergroup Chromalveolata This is because
apart from their ability to capture light energy and fix CO2 they lack many structural and biochemical traits
that are characteristic of plants The plants are now classified along with the red and green algae in the
protist supergroup Archaeplastida Green algae contain the same carotenoids and chlorophyll a and b as land
plants whereas other algae have different accessory pigments and types of chlorophyll molecules in addition
to chlorophyll a Both green algae and land plants also store carbohydrates as starch Their cells contain
chloroplasts that display a dizzying variety of shapes and their cell walls contain cellulose as do land plants
Which of the green algae to include among the plants has not been phylogenetically resolved
Green algae fall into two major groups the chlorophytes and the charophytes The chlorophytes include the
genera Chlorella Chlamydomonas the sea lettuce Ulva and the colonial alga Volvox The charophytes include
