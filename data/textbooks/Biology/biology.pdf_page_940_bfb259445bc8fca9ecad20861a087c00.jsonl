Inside the leaf at the cellular level water on the surface of mesophyll cells saturates the cellulose microfibrils of
the primary cell wall The leaf contains many large intercellular air spaces for the exchange of oxygen for carbon
dioxide which is required for photosynthesis The wet cell wall is exposed to this leaf internal air space and
the water on the surface of the cells evaporates into the air spaces decreasing the thin film on the surface of
the mesophyll cells This decrease creates a greater tension on the water in the mesophyll cells Figure 3034
thereby increasing the pull on the water in the xylem vessels The xylem vessels and tracheids are structurally
adapted to cope with large changes in pressure Rings in the vessels maintain their tubular shape much like
the rings on a vacuum cleaner hose keep the hose open while it is under pressure Small perforations between
vessel elements reduce the number and size of gas bubbles that can form via a process called cavitation The
formation of gas bubbles in xylem interrupts the continuous stream of water from the base to the top of the plant
causing a break termed an embolism in the flow of xylem sap The taller the tree the greater the tension forces
needed to pull water and the more cavitation events In larger trees the resulting embolisms can plug xylem
vessels making them nonfunctional
