suspending it on the waters surface preventing it from sinking Notice the indentation in the water around the needle

These cohesive forces are related to waters property of adhesion or the attraction between water molecules
and other molecules This attraction is sometimes stronger than waters cohesive forces especially when the
water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes
We observe adhesion when water climbs up the tube placed in a glass of water notice that the water appears
to be higher on the tubes sides than in the middle This is because the water molecules are attracted to the
capillarys charged glass walls more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it We call this type of
adhesion capillary action as Figure 217 illustrates
Figure 217 The adhesive forces exerted by the glass internal surface exceeding the cohesive forces between the
water molecules themselves causes capillary action in a glass tube credit modification of work by PearsonScott

Why are cohesive and adhesive forces important for life Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for
transporting water from the roots to the leaves in plants These forces create a pull on the water column This
pull results from the tendency of water molecules evaporating on the plants surface to stay connected to water
molecules below them and so they are pulled along Plants use this natural phenomenon to help transport water
from their roots to their leaves Without these properties of water plants would be unable to receive the water
and the dissolved minerals they require In another example insects such as the water strider as Figure 218
shows use the waters surface tension to stay afloat on the waters surface layer and even mate there
