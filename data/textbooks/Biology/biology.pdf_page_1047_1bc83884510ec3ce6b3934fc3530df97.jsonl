Figure 346 a Humans and herbivores such as the b rabbit have a monogastric digestive system However in
the rabbit the small intestine and cecum are enlarged to allow more time to digest plant material The enlarged organ
provides more surface area for absorption of nutrients Rabbits digest their food twice the first time food passes
through the digestive system it collects in the cecum and then it passes as soft feces called cecotrophes The rabbit
reingests these cecotrophes to further digest them
Avian
Birds face special challenges when it comes to obtaining nutrition from food They do not have teeth and
so their digestive system shown in Figure 347 must be able to process unmasticated food Birds have
evolved a variety of beak types that reflect the vast variety in their diet ranging from seeds and insects to fruits
and nuts Because most birds fly their metabolic rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep
their body weight low The stomach of birds has two chambers the proventriculus where gastric juices are
produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach and the gizzard where the food is stored soaked and
mechanically ground The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated Most of the
chemical digestion and absorption happens in the intestine and the waste is excreted through the cloaca
