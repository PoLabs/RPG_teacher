Each I band has a dense line running vertically through the middle called a Z disc or Z line The Z discs mark
the border of units called sarcomeres which are the functional units of skeletal muscle One sarcomere is the
space between two consecutive Z discs and contains one entire A band and two halves of an I band one on
either side of the A band A myofibril is composed of many sarcomeres running along its length and as the
sarcomeres individually contract the myofibrils and muscle cells shorten Figure 3835
Figure 3835 A sarcomere is the region from one Z line to the next Z line Many sarcomeres are present in a myofibril
resulting in the striation pattern characteristic of skeletal muscle
Myofibrils are composed of smaller structures called myofilaments There are two main types of filaments thick
filaments and thin filaments each has different compositions and locations Thick filaments occur only in the
A band of a myofibril Thin filaments attach to a protein in the Z disc called alphaactinin and occur across the
entire length of the I band and partway into the A band The region at which thick and thin filaments overlap has
a dense appearance as there is little space between the filaments Thin filaments do not extend all the way into
the A bands leaving a central region of the A band that only contains thick filaments This central region of the
A band looks slightly lighter than the rest of the A band and is called the H zone The middle of the H zone has a
vertical line called the M line at which accessory proteins hold together thick filaments Both the Z disc and the
M line hold myofilaments in place to maintain the structural arrangement and layering of the myofibril Myofibrils
are connected to each other by intermediate or desmin filaments that attach to the Z disc
Thick and thin filaments are themselves composed of proteins Thick filaments are composed of the protein
myosin The tail of a myosin molecule connects with other myosin molecules to form the central region of a thick
filament near the M line whereas the heads align on either side of the thick filament where the thin filaments
overlap The primary component of thin filaments is the actin protein Two other components of the thin filament
are tropomyosin and troponin Actin has binding sites for myosin attachment Strands of tropomyosin block the
binding sites and prevent actinmyosin interactions when the muscles are at rest Troponin consists of three
globular subunits One subunit binds to tropomyosin one subunit binds to actin and one subunit binds Ca2
ions

Sliding Filament Model of Contraction
For a muscle cell to contract the sarcomere must shorten However thick and thin filamentsthe components
of sarcomeresdo not shorten Instead they slide by one another causing the sarcomere to shorten while
the filaments remain the same length The sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was developed to fit
the differences observed in the named bands on the sarcomere at different degrees of muscle contraction and
relaxation The mechanism of contraction is the binding of myosin to actin forming crossbridges that generate
