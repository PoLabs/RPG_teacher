The Evolution of the Coelom
One of the first steps in the classification of animals is to examine the animals body One structure that
is used in classification of animals is the body cavity or coelom The body cavity develops within the
mesoderm so only triploblastic animals can have body cavities Therefore body cavities are found only
within the Bilateria In other animal clades the gut is either close to the body wall or separated from it by
a jellylike material The body cavity is important for two reasons Fluid within the body cavity protects the
organs from shock and compression In addition since in triploblastic embryos most muscle connective
tissue and blood vessels develop from mesoderm these tissues developing within the lining of the body
cavity can reinforce the gut and body wall aid in motility and efficiently circulate nutrients
To recap what we have discussed above animals that do not have a coelom are called acoelomates The
major acoelomate group in the Bilateria is the flatworms including both freeliving and parasitic forms such
as tapeworms In these animals mesenchyme fills the space between the gut and the body wall Although
two layers of muscle are found just under the epidermis there is no muscle or other mesodermal tissue
around the gut Flatworms rely on passive diffusion for nutrient transport across their body
In pseudocoelomates there is a body cavity between the gut and the body wall but only the body wall
has mesodermal tissue In these animals the mesoderm forms but does not develop cavities within
it Major pseudocoelomate phyla are the rotifers and nematodes Animals that have a true coelom are
called eucoelomates all vertebrates as well as molluscs annelids arthropods and echinoderms are
eucoelomates The coelom develops within the mesoderm during embryogenesis Of the major bilaterian
phyla the molluscs annelids and arthropods are schizocoels in which the mesoderm splits to form the
body cavity while the echinoderms and chordates are enterocoels in which the mesoderm forms as two or
more buds off of the gut These buds separate from the gut and coalesce to form the body cavity In the
vertebrates mammals have a subdivided body cavity with the thoracic cavity separated from the abdominal
cavity The pseudocoelomates may have had eucoelomate ancestors and may have lost their ability to form
a complete coelom through genetic mutations Thus this step in early embryogenesisthe formation of the
coelomhas had a large evolutionary impact on the various species of the animal kingdom
273  Animal Phylogeny
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Interpret the metazoan phylogenetic tree

Describe the types of data that scientists use to construct and revise animal phylogeny

List some of the relationships within the modern phylogenetic tree that have been discovered as a result
of modern molecular data
Biologists strive to understand the evolutionary history and relationships of members of the animal kingdom
and all of life for that matter The study of phylogeny the branching sequence of evolution aims to determine
the evolutionary relationships between phyla Currently most biologists divide the animal kingdom into 35 to 40
phyla Scientists develop phylogenetic trees which serve as hypotheses about which species have evolved from
which ancestors
Recall that until recently only morphological characteristics and the fossil record were used to determine
phylogenetic relationships among animals Scientific understanding of the distinctions and hierarchies between
anatomical characteristics provided much of this knowledge Used alone however this information can be
misleading Morphological characteristics such as skin color body shape etc may evolve multiple times and
independently through evolutionary history Analogous characteristics may appear similar between animals
but their underlying evolution may be very different With the advancement of molecular technologies modern
phylogenetics is now informed by genetic and molecular analyses in addition to traditional morphological and
fossil data With a growing understanding of genetics the animal evolutionary tree has changed substantially
