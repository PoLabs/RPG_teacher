chemoautotrophs and leaving as heat during the many transfers between trophic levels However the matter
that makes up living organisms is conserved and recycled The six most common elements associated with
organic moleculescarbon nitrogen hydrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfurtake a variety of chemical
forms and may exist for long periods in the atmosphere on land in water or beneath the Earths surface
Geologic processes such as weathering erosion water drainage and the subduction of the continental plates
all play a role in this recycling of materials Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study
of this process the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a
biogeochemical cycle
Water contains hydrogen and oxygen which is essential to all living processes The hydrosphere is the area
of the Earth where water movement and storage occurs On or beneath the surface water occurs in liquid or
solid form in rivers lakes oceans groundwater polar ice caps and glaciers And it occurs as water vapor in
the atmosphere Carbon is found in all organic macromolecules and is an important constituent of fossil fuels
Nitrogen is a major component of our nucleic acids and proteins and is critical to human agriculture Phosphorus
a major component of nucleic acid along with nitrogen is one of the main ingredients in artificial fertilizers used
in agriculture and their associated environmental impacts on our surface water Sulfur is critical to the 3D folding
of proteins such as in disulfide binding
The cycling of these elements is interconnected For example the movement of water is critical for the leaching
of nitrogen and phosphate into rivers lakes and oceans Furthermore the ocean itself is a major reservoir for
carbon Thus mineral nutrients are cycled either rapidly or slowly through the entire biosphere from one living
organism to another and between the biotic and abiotic world

The Water Hydrologic Cycle
Water is the basis of all living processes on Earth When examining the stores of water on Earth 975 percent of
it is nonpotable salt water Figure 4612 Of the remaining water 99 percent is locked underground as water
or as ice Thus less than 1 percent of fresh water is easily accessible from lakes and rivers Many living things
such as plants animals and fungi are dependent on that small amount of fresh surface water a lack of which
can have massive effects on ecosystem dynamics To be successful organisms must adapt to fluctuating water
supplies Humans of course have developed technologies to increase water availability such as digging wells
to harvest groundwater storing rainwater and using desalination to obtain drinkable water from the ocean
Figure 4612 Only 25 percent of water on Earth is fresh water and less than 1 percent of fresh water is easily
accessible to living things
