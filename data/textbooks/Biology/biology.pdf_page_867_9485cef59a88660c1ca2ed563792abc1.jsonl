Class Petromyzontida Lampreys
The class Petromyzontida includes approximately 40 species of lampreys which are superficially similar to
hagfishes in size and shape However lampreys possess extrinsic eye muscles at least two semicircular canals
and a true cerebellum as well as simple vertebral elements called arcualiacartilaginous structures arranged
above the notochord These features are also shared with the gnathostomesvertebrates with jawed mouths
and paired appendages see below Lampreys also have a dorsal tubular nerve cord with a welldifferentiated
brain a small cerebellum and 10 pairs of nerves The classification of lampreys is still debated but they clearly
represent one of the oldest divergences of the vertebrate lineage Lampreys lack paired appendages as do the
hagfishes although they have one or two fleshy dorsal fins As adults lampreys are characterized by a rasping
tongue within a toothed funnellike sucking mouth Many species have a parasitic stage of their life cycle during
which they are fish ectoparasites some call them predators because they attack and eventually fall off Figure

and use their rough tongues to rasp away flesh in order to feed on the trouts blood credit USGS
Lampreys live primarily in coastal and freshwater environments and have a worldwide distribution except for the
tropics and polar regions Some species are marine but all species spawn in fresh water Interestingly northern
lampreys in the family Petromyzontidae have the highest number of chromosomes 164 to 174 among the
vertebrates Eggs are fertilized externally and the larvae called ammocoetes differ greatly from the adult form
closely resembling the adult cephalocordate amphioxus After spending three to 15 years as suspension feeders
in rivers and streams they attain sexual maturity Shortly afterward the adults swim upstream reproduce and
die within days
Gnathostomes Jawed Fishes
Gnathostomes or jawmouths are vertebrates that possess true jawsa milestone in the evolution of the
vertebrates In fact one of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development
of the jaw a hinged structure attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food Jaws were
probably derived from the first pair of gill arches supporting the gills of jawless fishes
Early gnathostomes also possessed two sets of paired fins allowing the fishes to maneuver accurately Pectoral
fins are typically located on the anterior body and pelvic fins on the posterior Evolution of the jaw and paired fins
permitted gnathostomes to expand their food options from the scavenging and suspension feeding of jawless
fishes to active predation The ability of gnathostomes to exploit new nutrient sources probably contributed to
their replacing most jawless fishes during the Devonian period Two early groups of gnathostomes were the
acanthodians and placoderms Figure 2911 which arose in the late Silurian period and are now extinct Most
modern fishes are gnathostomes that belong to the clades Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes which include the
class Actinoptertygii and class Sarcopterygii
