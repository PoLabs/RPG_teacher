ddCTP ddATP ddGTP and ddTTP are added to each tube respectively The tubes are labeled as A T G and
C according to the ddNTP added For detection purposes each of the four dideoxynucleotides carries a different
fluorescent label Chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy nucleotide is incorporated after which
no further elongation takes place After the reaction is over electrophoresis is performed Even a difference in
length of a single base can be detected The sequence is read from a laser scanner that detects the fluorescent
marker of each fragment For his work on DNA sequencing Sanger received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980
Sangers genome sequencing has led to a race to sequence human genomes at rapid speed and low cost
often referred to as the 1000inoneday sequence Learn more by selecting the Sequencing at Speed

Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes Usually the gel is
made of a chemical called agarose a polysaccharide polymer extracted from seaweed that is high in galactose
residues Agarose powder is added to a buffer and heated After cooling the gel solution is poured into a casting
tray Once the gel has solidified the DNA is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied The DNA has a
net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode The electric current is
applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according to size the smallest fragments will be farthest from
the well where the DNA was loaded and the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest to the well
Once the DNA is separated the gel is stained with a DNAspecific dye for viewing it Figure 149
