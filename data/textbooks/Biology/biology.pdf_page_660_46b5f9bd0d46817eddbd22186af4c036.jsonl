The apicomplexan protists are named for a structure called an apical complex Figure 2323 which appears
to be a highly modified secondary chloroplast The apicoplast genome is similar to those of dinoflagellate
chloroplasts The apical complex is specialized for entry and infection of host cells Indeed all apicomplexans
are parasitic This group includes the genus Plasmodium which causes malaria in humans Apicomplexan life
cycles are complex involving multiple hosts and stages of sexual and asexual reproduction
Figure 2323 Apicomplexa a Apicomplexans are parasitic protists They have a characteristic apical complex that
enables them to infect host cells b Plasmodium the causative agent of malaria has a complex life cycle typical of

The ciliates which include Paramecium and Tetrahymena are a group of protists 10 to 3000 micrometers
in length that are covered in rows tufts or spirals of tiny cilia By beating their cilia synchronously or in
waves ciliates can coordinate directed movements and ingest food particles Certain ciliates have fused cilia
based structures that function like paddles funnels or fins Ciliates also are surrounded by a pellicle providing
protection without compromising agility The genus Paramecium includes protists that have organized their cilia
into a platelike primitive mouth called an oral groove which is used to capture and digest bacteria Figure
2324 Food captured in the oral groove enters a food vacuole where it combines with digestive enzymes
Waste particles are expelled by an exocytic vesicle that fuses at a specific region on the cell membrane called
the anal pore In addition to a vacuolebased digestive system Paramecium also uses contractile vacuoles
which are osmoregulatory vesicles that fill with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contract to
squeeze water from the cell Ciliates therefore exhibit considerable structural complexity without having achieved
multicellularity
