By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain transformation of DNA

Describe the key experiments that helped identify that DNA is the genetic material

State and explain Chargaffs rules
Our current understanding of DNA began with the discovery of nucleic acids followed by the development of
the doublehelix model In the 1860s Friedrich Miescher Figure 142 a physician by profession isolated
phosphaterich chemicals from white blood cells leukocytes He named these chemicals which would
eventually be known as DNA nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells
Figure 142 Friedrich Miescher 18441895 discovered nucleic acids

A half century later in 1928 British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith reported the first demonstration of bacterial
transformationa process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell thereby changing its morphology
and physiology Griffith conducted his experiments with Streptococcus pneumoniae a bacterium that causes
pneumonia Griffith worked with two strains of this bacterium called rough R and smooth S The two cell
types were called rough and smooth after the appearance of their colonies grown on a nutrient agar plate
The R strain is nonpathogenic does not cause disease The S strain is pathogenic diseasecausing and has
a capsule outside its cell wall The capsule allows the cell to escape the immune responses of the host mouse
When Griffith injected the living S strain into mice they died from pneumonia In contrast when Griffith injected
the live R strain into mice they survived In another experiment when he injected mice with the heatkilled S
strain they also survived This experiment showed that the capsule alone was not the cause of death In a
third set of experiments a mixture of live R strain and heatkilled S strain were injected into mice andto his
surprisethe mice died Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse only the S strain of bacteria
was recovered When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh mice the mice died Griffith concluded that
something had passed from the heatkilled S strain into the live R strain and transformed it into the pathogenic
S strain He called this the transforming principle Figure 143 These experiments are now known as Griffiths
