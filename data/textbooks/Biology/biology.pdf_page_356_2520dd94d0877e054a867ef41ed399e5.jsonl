Nevertheless these laws summarize the basics of classical genetics
Pairs of Unit Factors or Genes
Mendel proposed first that paired unit factors of heredity were transmitted faithfully from generation to generation
by the dissociation and reassociation of paired factors during gametogenesis and fertilization respectively After
he crossed peas with contrasting traits and found that the recessive trait resurfaced in the F2 generation Mendel
deduced that hereditary factors must be inherited as discrete units This finding contradicted the belief at that
time that parental traits were blended in the offspring
Alleles Can Be Dominant or Recessive
Mendels law of dominance states that in a heterozygote one trait will conceal the presence of another trait
for the same characteristic Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype the dominant allele will be
expressed exclusively The recessive allele will remain latent but will be transmitted to offspring by the same
manner in which the dominant allele is transmitted The recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that
have two copies of this allele Figure 1215 and these offspring will breed true when selfcrossed
Since Mendels experiments with pea plants researchers have found that the law of dominance does not always
hold true Instead several different patterns of inheritance have been found to exist
Figure 1215 The child in the photo expresses albinism a recessive trait
Equal Segregation of Alleles
Observing that truebreeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F1 generations that all expressed
the dominant trait and F2 generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 31 ratio Mendel
proposed the law of segregation This law states that paired unit factors genes must segregate equally
into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor For the F2 generation
of a monohybrid cross the following three possible combinations of genotypes could result homozygous
dominant heterozygous or homozygous recessive Because heterozygotes could arise from two different
pathways receiving one dominant and one recessive allele from either parent and because heterozygotes
and homozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically identical the law supports Mendels observed 31
phenotypic ratio The equal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the Punnett square to accurately
predict the offspring of parents with known genotypes The physical basis of Mendels law of segregation is the
first division of meiosis in which the homologous chromosomes with their different versions of each gene are
segregated into daughter nuclei The role of the meiotic segregation of chromosomes in sexual reproduction was
not understood by the scientific community during Mendels lifetime
