Cellular Communication in Yeasts
The first cellular form of life on our planet likely consisted of singlecelled prokaryotic organisms that had
limited interaction with each other While some external signaling occurs between different species of single
celled organisms the majority of signaling within bacteria and yeasts concerns only other members of the
same species The evolution of cellular communication is an absolute necessity for the development of
multicellular organisms and this innovation is thought to have required approximately 2 billion years to
appear in early life forms
Yeasts are singlecelled eukaryotes and therefore have a nucleus and organelles characteristic of more
complex life forms Comparisons of the genomes of yeasts nematode worms fruit flies and humans
illustrate the evolution of increasingly complex signaling systems that allow for the efficient inner workings
that keep humans and other complex life forms functioning correctly
Kinases are a major component of cellular communication and studies of these enzymes illustrate the
evolutionary connectivity of different species Yeasts have 130 types of kinases More complex organisms
such as nematode worms and fruit flies have 454 and 239 kinases respectively Of the 130 kinase types
in yeast 97 belong to the 55 subfamilies of kinases that are found in other eukaryotic organisms The
only obvious deficiency seen in yeasts is the complete absence of tyrosine kinases It is hypothesized that
phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is needed to control the more sophisticated functions of development
differentiation and cellular communication used in multicellular organisms
Because yeasts contain many of the same classes of signaling proteins as humans these organisms
are ideal for studying signaling cascades Yeasts multiply quickly and are much simpler organisms than
humans or other multicellular animals Therefore the signaling cascades are also simpler and easier to
study although they contain similar counterparts to human signaling2
