Fertilization
Fertilization pictured in Figure 4323a is the process in which gametes an egg and sperm fuse to form a
zygote The egg and sperm each contain one set of chromosomes To ensure that the offspring has only one
complete diploid set of chromosomes only one sperm must fuse with one egg In mammals the egg is protected
by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida When a sperm
binds to the zona pellucida a series of biochemical events called the acrosomal reactions take place In
placental mammals the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation of the glycoprotein
matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane as
illustrated in Figure 4323b The fusion of these two membranes creates an opening through which the sperm
nucleus is transferred into the ovum The nuclear membranes of the egg and sperm break down and the two
haploid genomes condense to form a diploid genome

To ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg once the acrosomal reactions take place at one
location of the egg membrane the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing
with the egg If this mechanism fails multiple sperm can fuse with the egg resulting in polyspermy The
resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies within a few days
Cleavage and Blastula Stage
The development of multicellular organisms begins from a singlecelled zygote which undergoes rapid cell
division to form the blastula The rapid multiple rounds of cell division are termed cleavage Cleavage is
illustrated in Figure 4324a After the cleavage has produced over 100 cells the embryo is called a blastula
The blastula is usually a spherical layer of cells the blastoderm surrounding a fluidfilled or yolkfilled cavity the
blastocoel Mammals at this stage form a structure called the blastocyst characterized by an inner cell mass
that is distinct from the surrounding blastula shown in Figure 4324b During cleavage the cells divide without
an increase in mass that is one large singlecelled zygote divides into multiple smaller cells Each cell within
the blastula is called a blastomere
Figure 4324 a During cleavage the zygote rapidly divides into multiple cells without increasing in size b The cells
rearrange themselves to form a hollow ball with a fluidfilled or yolkfilled cavity called the blastula
Cleavage can take place in two ways holoblastic total cleavage or meroblastic partial cleavage The
type of cleavage depends on the amount of yolk in the eggs In placental mammals including humans where
nourishment is provided by the mothers body the eggs have a very small amount of yolk and undergo
