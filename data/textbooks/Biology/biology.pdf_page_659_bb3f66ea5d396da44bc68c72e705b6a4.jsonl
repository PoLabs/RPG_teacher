Alveolates Dinoflagellates Apicomplexians and Ciliates
A large body of data supports that the alveolates are derived from a shared common ancestor The alveolates
are named for the presence of an alveolus or membraneenclosed sac beneath the cell membrane The
exact function of the alveolus is unknown but it may be involved in osmoregulation The alveolates are further
categorized into some of the betterknown protists the dinoflagellates the apicomplexans and the ciliates
Dinoflagellates exhibit extensive morphological diversity and can be photosynthetic heterotrophic or
mixotrophic The chloroplast of photosynthetic dinoflagellates was derived by secondary endosymbiosis of
a red alga Many dinoflagellates are encased in interlocking plates of cellulose Two perpendicular flagella
fit into the grooves between the cellulose plates with one flagellum extending longitudinally and a second
encircling the dinoflagellate Figure 2321 Together the flagella contribute to the characteristic spinning motion
of dinoflagellates These protists exist in freshwater and marine habitats and are a component of plankton the
typically microscopic organisms that drift through the water and serve as a crucial food source for larger aquatic
organisms
Figure 2321 Dinoflagellates The dinoflagellates exhibit great diversity in shape Many are encased in cellulose armor
and have two flagella that fit in grooves between the plates Movement of these two perpendicular flagella causes a
spinning motion
Dinoflagellates have a nuclear variant called a dinokaryon The chromosomes in the dinokaryon are highly
condensed throughout the cell cycle and do not have typical histones Mitosis in dinoflagellates is closed that is
the spindle separates the chromosomes from outside of the nucleus without breakdown of the nuclear envelope
Some dinoflagellates generate light called bioluminescence when they are jarred or stressed Large numbers
of marine dinoflagellates billions or trillions of cells per wave can emit light and cause an entire breaking wave
to twinkle or take on a brilliant blue color Figure 2322 For approximately 20 species of marine dinoflagellates
population explosions also called blooms during the summer months can tint the ocean with a muddy red color
This phenomenon is called a red tide and it results from the abundant red pigments present in dinoflagellate
plastids In large quantities these dinoflagellate species secrete an asphyxiating toxin that can kill fish birds and
marine mammals Red tides can be massively detrimental to commercial fisheries and humans who consume
these protists may become poisoned
