Plant viruses can seriously disrupt crop growth and development significantly affecting our food supply They
are responsible for poor crop quality and quantity globally and can bring about huge economic losses annually
Others viruses may damage plants used in landscaping Some viruses that infect agricultural food plants include
the name of the plant they infect such as tomato spotted wilt virus bean common mosaic virus and cucumber
mosaic virus In plants used for landscaping two of the most common viruses are peony ring spot and rose
mosaic virus There are far too many plant viruses to discuss each in detail but symptoms of bean common
mosaic virus result in lowered bean production and stunted unproductive plants In the ornamental rose the
rose mosaic disease causes wavy yellow lines and colored splotches on the leaves of the plant
Animal Viruses
Animal viruses unlike the viruses of plants and bacteria do not have to penetrate a cell wall to gain access to
the host cell The virus may even induce the host cell to cooperate in the infection process Nonenveloped or
naked animal viruses may enter cells in two different ways As a protein in the viral capsid binds to its receptor
on the host cell the virus may be taken inside the cell via a vesicle during the normal cell process of receptor
mediated endocytosis An alternative method of cell penetration used by nonenveloped viruses is for capsid
proteins to undergo shape changes after binding to the receptor creating channels in the host cell membrane
The viral genome is then injected into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used
by many bacteriophages
Enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors receptormediated
endocytosis or fusion Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptormediated endocytosis in a fashion
similar to that seen in some nonenveloped viruses On the other hand fusion only occurs with enveloped
virions These viruses which include HIV among others use special fusion proteins in their envelopes to cause
the envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell thus releasing the genome and capsid of the virus
into the cell cytoplasm
After making their proteins and copying their genomes animal viruses complete the assembly of new virions
and exit the cell As we have already discussed using the example the influenza virus enveloped animal viruses
may bud from the cell membrane as they assemble themselves taking a piece of the cells plasma membrane in
the process On the other hand nonenveloped viral progeny such as rhinoviruses accumulate in infected cells
until there is a signal for lysis or apoptosis and all virions are released together
As you will learn in the next module animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases Some
of them follow the classic pattern of acute disease where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period
followed by the elimination of the virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the
infection Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza Other viruses cause longterm
chronic infections such as the virus causing hepatitis C whereas others like herpes simplex virus only cause
intermittent symptoms Still other viruses such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7 which in some cases can
cause the minor childhood disease roseola often successfully cause productive infections without causing any
symptoms at all in the host and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection
In hepatitis C infections the virus grows and reproduces in liver cells causing low levels of liver damage The
damage is so low that infected individuals are often unaware that they are infected and many infections are
detected only by routine blood work on patients with risk factors such as intravenous drug use On the other
hand since many of the symptoms of viral diseases are caused by immune responses a lack of symptoms
is an indication of a weak immune response to the virus This allows the virus to escape elimination by the
