Figure 76 The first half of glycolysis uses two ATP molecules in the phosphorylation of glucose which is then split
into two threecarbon molecules
Second Half of Glycolysis EnergyReleasing Steps
So far glycolysis has cost the cell two ATP molecules and produced two small threecarbon sugar molecules
Both of these molecules will proceed through the second half of the pathway and sufficient energy will be
extracted to pay back the two ATP molecules used as an initial investment and produce a profit for the cell of
two additional ATP molecules and two even higherenergy NADH molecules
Step 6 The sixth step in glycolysis Figure 77 oxidizes the sugar glyceraldehyde3phosphate extracting
highenergy electrons which are picked up by the electron carrier NAD producing NADH The sugar is then
phosphorylated by the addition of a second phosphate group producing 13bisphosphoglycerate Note that the
second phosphate group does not require another ATP molecule
Figure 77 The second half of glycolysis involves phosphorylation without ATP investment step 6 and produces two
NADH and four ATP molecules per glucose
Here again is a potential limiting factor for this pathway The continuation of the reaction depends upon the
availability of the oxidized form of the electron carrier NAD Thus NADH must be continuously oxidized back
into NAD in order to keep this step going If NAD is not available the second half of glycolysis slows down
or stops If oxygen is available in the system the NADH will be oxidized readily though indirectly and the high
energy electrons from the hydrogen released in this process will be used to produce ATP In an environment
without oxygen an alternate pathway fermentation can provide the oxidation of NADH to NAD
Step 7 In the seventh step catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase an enzyme named for the reverse reaction
13bisphosphoglycerate donates a highenergy phosphate to ADP forming one molecule of ATP This is an
example of substratelevel phosphorylation A carbonyl group on the 13bisphosphoglycerate is oxidized to a
carboxyl group and 3phosphoglycerate is formed
Step 8 In the eighth step the remaining phosphate group in 3phosphoglycerate moves from the third carbon to
the second carbon producing 2phosphoglycerate an isomer of 3phosphoglycerate The enzyme catalyzing
this step is a mutase isomerase
Step 9 Enolase catalyzes the ninth step This enzyme causes 2phosphoglycerate to lose water from its
structure this is a dehydration reaction resulting in the formation of a double bond that increases the potential
