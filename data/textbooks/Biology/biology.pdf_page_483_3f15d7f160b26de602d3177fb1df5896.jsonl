together and thereby deduced that the genes were physically linked by their location on the same chromosome
Gene mapping relative to each other based on linkage analysis led to developing the first genetic maps
Observations that certain traits were always linked and certain others were not linked came from studying the
offspring of crosses between parents with different traits For example in garden pea experiments researchers
discovered that the flowers color and plant pollens shape were linked traits and therefore the genes encoding
these traits were in close proximity on the same chromosome We call exchanging DNA between homologous
chromosome pairs genetic recombination which occurs by crossing over DNA between homologous DNA
strands such as nonsister chromatids Linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between
any two genes The greater the distance between two genes the higher the chance that a recombination event
will occur between them and the higher the recombination frequency between them Figure 1711 shows two
possibilities for recombination between two nonsister chromatids during meiosis If the recombination frequency
between two genes is less than 50 percent they are linked
Figure 1711 Crossover may occur at different locations on the chromosome Recombination between genes A and B
is more frequent than recombination between genes B and C because genes A and B are farther apart Therefore a
crossover is more likely to occur between them
The generation of genetic maps requires markers just as a road map requires landmarks such as rivers
and mountains Scientists based early genetic maps on using known genes as markers Scientists now use
more sophisticated markers including those based on noncoding DNA to compare individuals genomes in a
population Although individuals of a given species are genetically similar they are not identical Every individual
has a unique set of traits These minor differences in the genome between individuals in a population are useful
for genetic mapping purposes In general a good genetic marker is a region on the chromosome that shows
variability or polymorphism multiple forms in the population
Some genetic markers that scientists use in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length
polymorphisms RFLP variable number of tandem repeats VNTRs microsatellite polymorphisms and
the single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs We can detect RFLPs sometimes pronounced riflips when
the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA
to generate a series of DNA fragments which we can then analyze using gel electrophoresis Every individuals
DNA will give rise to a unique pattern of bands when cut with a particular set of restriction endonucleases
Scientists sometimes refer to this as an individuals DNA fingerprint Certain chromosome regions that are
subject to polymorphism will lead to generating the unique banding pattern VNTRs are repeated sets of
nucleotides present in DNAs noncoding regions Noncoding or junk DNA has no known biological function
however research shows that much of this DNA is actually transcribed While its function is uncertain it is
certainly active and it may be involved in regulating coding genes The number of repeats may vary in a
populations individual organisms Microsatellite polymorphisms are similar to VNTRs but the repeat unit is very
small SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide
