Figure 1612 RNAbinding proteins The proteincoding region of this processed mRNA is flanked by 5 and 3
untranslated regions UTRs The presence of RNAbinding proteins at the 5 or 3 UTR influences the stability of the
RNA molecule
RNA Stability and microRNAs
In addition to RBPs that bind to and control increase or decrease RNA stability other elements called
microRNAs can bind to the RNA molecule These microRNAs or miRNAs are short RNA molecules that
are only 21 to 24 nucleotides in length The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer premiRNAs These
premiRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called Dicer Like transcription factors and RBPs
mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA however miRNAs also associate with a
ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNAinduced silencing complex RISC The RNA component of the
RISC basepairs with complementary sequences on an mRNA and either impede translation of the message or
lead to the degradation of the mRNA
166  Eukaryotic Translational and Posttranslational
Gene Regulation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Understand the process of translation and discuss its key factors

Describe how the initiation complex controls translation

Explain the different ways in which the posttranslational control of gene expression takes place
After RNA has been transported to the cytoplasm it is translated into protein Control of this process is largely
dependent on the RNA molecule As previously discussed the stability of the RNA will have a large impact on
its translation into a protein As the stability changes the amount of time that it is available for translation also
changes
The Initiation Complex and Translation Rate
Like transcription translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process In translation the
complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the translation initiation complex In eukaryotes
translation is initiated by binding the initiating mettRNAi to the 40S ribosome This tRNA is brought to the 40S
ribosome by a protein initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor2 eIF2 The eIF2 protein binds to the
highenergy molecule guanosine triphosphate GTP The tRNAeIF2GTP complex then binds to the 40S
ribosome A second complex forms on the mRNA Several different initiation factors recognize the 5 cap of the
mRNA and proteins bound to the polyA tail of the same mRNA forming the mRNA into a loop The capbinding
protein eIF4F brings the mRNA complex together with the 40S ribosome complex The ribosome then scans
along the mRNA until it finds a start codon AUG When the anticodon of the initiator tRNA and the start codon
are aligned the GTP is hydrolyzed the initiation factors are released and the large 60S ribosomal subunit
binds to form the translation complex The binding of eIF2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation If eIF2 is
phosphorylated it undergoes a conformational change and cannot bind to GTP Therefore the initiation complex
cannot form properly and translation is impeded Figure 1613 When eIF2 remains unphosphorylated the
initiation complex can form normally and translation can proceed
