metacercaria larvae released from the snail host locate and penetrate the skin The parasite infects various
organs in the body and feeds on red blood cells before reproducing
Many of the eggs are released in feces and find their way into a waterway where they are able to reinfect
the snail host The eggs which have a barb on them can damage the vascular system of the human host
causing ulceration abscesses and bloody diarrhea wherever they reside thereby allowing other pathogens
to cause secondary infections In fact it is the parasites eggs that produce most of the main ill effects of
schistosomiasis Many eggs do not make the transit through the veins of the host for elimination and are swept
by blood flow back to the liver and other locations where they can cause severe inflammation In the liver the
errant eggs may impede circulation and cause cirrhosis Control is difficult in impoverished areas in unsanitary
crowded conditions and prognosis is poor in people with heavy infections of Schistosoma japonicum without
early treatment
The cestodes or tapeworms are also internal parasites mainly of vertebrates Figure 2816 Tapeworms such
as those of Taenia spp live in the intestinal tract of the primary host and remain fixed using a sucker or hooks
on the anterior end or scolex of the tapeworm body which is essentially a colony of similar subunits called
proglottids Each proglottid may contain an excretory system with flame cells along with reproductive structures
both male and female Because they are so long and flat tapeworms do not need a digestive system instead
they absorb nutrients from the food matter surrounding them in the hosts intestine by diffusion
Proglottids are produced at the scolex and gradually migrate to the end of the tapeworm at this point they
are mature and all structures except fertilized eggs have degenerated Most reproduction occurs by cross
fertilization between different worms in the same host but may also occur between proglottids The mature
proglottids detach from the body of the worm and are released into the feces of the organism The eggs are
eaten by an intermediate host typically another vertebrate The juvenile worm infects the intermediate host and
takes up residence usually in muscle tissue When the muscle tissue is consumed by the primary host the
cycle is completed There are several tapeworm parasites of humans that are transmitted by eating uncooked or
poorly cooked pork beef or fish

undercooked infected meat credit modification of work by CDC
