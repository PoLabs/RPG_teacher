CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
29 How does diffusion limit the size of an organism
How is this counteracted
30 What is the relationship between BMR and body
size Why
31 Explain how using an open circulatory system
constrains the size of animals
32 Describe one key environmental constraint for
ectotherms and one for endotherms Why are they
limited by different factors
33 How can squamous epithelia both facilitate
diffusion and prevent damage from abrasion
34 What are the similarities between cartilage and
bone
35 Multiple sclerosis is a debilitating autoimmune
disease that results in the loss of the insulation
around neuron axons What cell type is the immune
system attacking and how does this disrupt the
transfer of messages by the nervous system
36 When a person leads a sedentary life his skeletal
muscles atrophy but his smooth muscles do not
Why
37 Why are negative feedback loops used to control
body homeostasis
38 Why is a fever a good thing during a bacterial
infection
39 How is a condition such as diabetes a good
example of the failure of a set point in humans
40 On a molecular level how can endotherms
produce their own heat by adjusting processes
associated with cellular respiration If needed review
