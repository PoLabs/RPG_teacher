signals to communicate with potential mates are able to signal over longer distances Sound waves and chemicals
can diffuse out into an environment while visual cues require a direct line of sight between the sender and receiver
Animals that use aural cues to acquire mates probably exhibit a lower population density than animals that use visual
cues

1 Figure 468 According to the first law of thermodynamics energy can neither be created nor destroyed Eventually
all energy consumed by living systems is lost as heat or used for respiration and the total energy output of the system
must equal the energy that went into it 3 Figure 4617 C Nitrification by bacteria converts nitrates NO3 to nitrites

26 Food webs show interacting groups of
different species and their many interconnections with each other and the environment Food chains are linear aspects
of food webs that describe the succession of organisms consuming one another at defined trophic levels Food webs
are a more accurate representation of the structure and dynamics of an ecosystem Food chains are easier to model
and use for experimental studies 28 Grazing food webs have a primary producer at their base which is either a
plant for terrestrial ecosystems or a phytoplankton for aquatic ecosystems The producers pass their energy to the
various trophic levels of consumers At the base of detrital food webs are the decomposers which pass this energy to
a variety of other consumers Detrital food webs are important for the health of many grazing food webs because they
eliminate dead and decaying organic material thus clearing space for new organisms and removing potential causes
of disease By breaking down dead organic matter decomposers also make mineral nutrients available to primary
producers this process is a vital link in nutrient cycling 30 Conceptual models allow ecologists to see the big picture
of how different components of the ecosystem interact with each other energy sources and resources However this
approach is more descriptive than quantitative so it is difficult to make conclusions about the resistance or resilience
of a system Analytical modeling creates a model that can predict how the ecosystems relationships will change in
response to disturbances but does not convey the complexity of the relationships seen with conceptual modeling
32 NPE measures the rate at which one trophic level can use and make biomass from what it attained in the previous
level taking into account respiration defecation and heat loss Endotherms have high metabolism and generate a
lot of body heat Although this gives them advantages in their activity level in colder temperatures these organisms
are 10 times less efficient at harnessing the energy from the food they eat compared with coldblooded animals and
thus have to eat more and more often 34 In this ecological model the oak trees producers would be at the bottom
the blue jays would be in the middle level primary consumer of acorns and the parasites would be at the top level
secondary consumer However the pyramid would be inverted since each bird could support several parasites and
each tree could support several birds This pyramid would appear to be the opposite of the energy flow pyramid

Many factors can kill life in a lake or ocean such as eutrophication by nutrientrich surface runoff oil spills toxic waste
spills changes in climate and the dumping of garbage into the ocean Eutrophication is a result of nutrientrich runoff
from land using artificial fertilizers high in nitrogen and phosphorus These nutrients cause the rapid and excessive
growth of microorganisms which deplete local dissolved oxygen and kill many fish and other aquatic organisms 38
Human activity has greatly increased the amount of carbon dioxide gas in the Earths atmosphere The oceanic and
atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are linked so that when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increase the amount
of dissolved carbon dioxide in the ocean also increases partial pressure of oxygen When carbon dioxide dissolves in
water it produces the weak acid bicarbonate Since the Industrial Revolution the pH of the ocean has dropped 01 pH
units a 30 increase in acidity

1 Figure 476 A An abundance of fern spores from several species was found below the KPg boundary but none
was found above 3 B 5 C 7 C 9 B 11 D 13 C 15 D 17 The hypothesized cause of the KPg extinction event is
an asteroid impact The first piece of evidence of the impact is a spike in iridium an element that is rare on Earth but
common in meteors in the geological layers that mark the KPg transition The second piece of evidence is an impact
crater off the Yucatn Peninsula that is the right size and age to have caused the extinction event 19 Crop plants
are derived from wild plants and genes from wild relatives are frequently brought into crop varieties by plant breeders
to add valued characteristics to the crops If the wild species are lost then this genetic variation would no longer be
available 21 Human population growth leads to unsustainable resource use which causes habitat destruction to build
new human settlements create agricultural fields and so on Larger human populations have also led to unsustainable
fishing and hunting of wild animal populations Excessive use of fossil fuels also leads to global warming 23 Larger
preserves will contain more species Preserves should have a buffer around them to protect species from edge effects
Preserves that are round or square are better than preserves with many thin arms
