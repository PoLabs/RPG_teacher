Testing Attraction of Flies by Rotting Flesh Smell
Question Will flowers that offer cues to bees attract carrion flies if sprayed with compounds that smell like
rotten flesh
Background Visitation of flowers by pollinating flies is a function mostly of smell Flies are attracted by
rotting flesh and carrions The putrid odor seems to be the major attractant The polyamines putrescine and
cadaverine which are the products of protein breakdown after animal death are the source of the pungent
smell of decaying meat Some plants strategically attract flies by synthesizing polyamines similar to those
generated by decaying flesh and thereby attract carrion flies
Flies seek out dead animals because they normally lay their eggs on them and their maggots feed on the
decaying flesh Interestingly time of death can be determined by a forensic entomologist based on the
stages and type of maggots recovered from cadavers
Hypothesis Because flies are drawn to other organisms based on smell and not sight a flower that is
normally attractive to bees because of its colors will attract flies if it is sprayed with polyamines similar to
those generated by decaying flesh
Test the hypothesis
1
Select flowers usually pollinated by bees White petunia may be a good choice
2
Divide the flowers into two groups and while wearing eye protection and gloves spray one group with
a solution of either putrescine or cadaverine Putrescine dihydrochloride is typically available in 98
percent concentration this can be diluted to approximately 50 percent for this experiment
3
Place the flowers in a location where flies are present keeping the sprayed and unsprayed flowers
separated
4
Observe the movement of the flies for one hour Record the number of visits to the flowers using a table
similar to Table 262 Given the rapid movement of flies it may be beneficial to use a video camera to
record the flyflower interaction Replay the video in slow motion to obtain an accurate record of the
number of fly visits to the flowers
5
Repeat the experiment four more times with the same species of flower but using different specimens
6
Repeat the entire experiment with a different type of flower that is normally pollinated by bees

Analyze your data Review the data you have recorded Average the number of visits that flies made to
sprayed flowers over the course of the five trials on the first flower type and compare and contrast them to
the average number of visits that flies made to the unsprayedcontrol flowers Can you draw any conclusions
regarding the attraction of the flies to the sprayed flowers
For the second flower type used average the number of visits that flies made to sprayed flowers over the
