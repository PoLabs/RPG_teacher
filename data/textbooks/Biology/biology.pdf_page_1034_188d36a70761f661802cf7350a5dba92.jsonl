Positive Feedback Loop
A positive feedback loop maintains the direction of the stimulus possibly accelerating it Few examples of
positive feedback loops exist in animal bodies but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result
in blood clotting or coagulation As one clotting factor is activated it activates the next factor in sequence until a
fibrin clot is achieved The direction is maintained not changed so this is positive feedback Another example of
positive feedback is uterine contractions during childbirth as illustrated in Figure 3321 The hormone oxytocin
made by the endocrine system stimulates the contraction of the uterus This produces pain sensed by the
nervous system Instead of lowering the oxytocin and causing the pain to subside more oxytocin is produced
until the contractions are powerful enough to produce childbirth

State whether each of the following processes is regulated by a positive feedback loop or a negative
feedback loop
a
A person feels satiated after eating a large meal
b
The blood has plenty of red blood cells As a result erythropoietin a hormone that stimulates the
production of new red blood cells is no longer released from the kidney
