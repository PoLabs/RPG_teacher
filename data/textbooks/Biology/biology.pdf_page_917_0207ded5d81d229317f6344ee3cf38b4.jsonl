Figure 304 Leaves are attached to the plant stem at areas called nodes An internode is the stem region between two
nodes The petiole is the stalk connecting the leaf to the stem The leaves just above the nodes arose from axillary
buds
Stem Anatomy
The stem and other plant organs arise from the ground tissue and are primarily made up of simple tissues
formed from three types of cells parenchyma collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells
Parenchyma cells are the most common plant cells Figure 305 They are found in the stem the root the
inside of the leaf and the pulp of the fruit Parenchyma cells are responsible for metabolic functions such as
photosynthesis and they help repair and heal wounds Some parenchyma cells also store starch
