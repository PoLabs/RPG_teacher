If the pathogen is never encountered again during the individuals lifetime B and T memory cells will circulate
for a few years or even several decades and will gradually die off having never functioned as effector cells
However if the host is reexposed to the same pathogen type circulating memory cells will immediately
differentiate into plasma cells and CTLs without input from APCs or TH cells One reason the adaptive immune
response is delayed is because it takes time for nave B and T cells with the appropriate antigen specificities
to be identified and activated Upon reinfection this step is skipped and the result is a more rapid production
of immune defenses Memory B cells that differentiate into plasma cells output tens to hundredsfold greater
antibody amounts than were secreted during the primary response as the graph in Figure 4217 illustrates This
rapid and dramatic antibody response may stop the infection before it can even become established and the
individual may not realize he or she had been exposed
Figure 4217 In the primary response to infection antibodies are secreted first from plasma cells Upon reexposure
to the same pathogen memory cells differentiate into antibodysecreting plasma cells that output a greater amount of
antibody for a longer period of time
Vaccination is based on the knowledge that exposure to noninfectious antigens derived from known pathogens
generates a mild primary immune response The immune response to vaccination may not be perceived by the
host as illness but still confers immune memory When exposed to the corresponding pathogen to which an
individual was vaccinated the reaction is similar to a secondary exposure Because each reinfection generates
more memory cells and increased resistance to the pathogen and because some memory cells die certain
vaccine courses involve one or more booster vaccinations to mimic repeat exposures for instance tetanus
boosters are necessary every ten years because the memory cells only live that long
Mucosal Immune Memory
A subset of T and B cells of the mucosal immune system differentiates into memory cells just as in the
systemic immune system Upon reinvasion of the same pathogen type a pronounced immune response occurs
at the mucosal site where the original pathogen deposited but a collective defense is also organized within
interconnected or adjacent mucosal tissue For instance the immune memory of an infection in the oral cavity
would also elicit a response in the pharynx if the oral cavity was exposed to the same pathogen
