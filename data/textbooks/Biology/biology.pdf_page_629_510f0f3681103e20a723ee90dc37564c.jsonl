Cheese production began around 4000 to 7000 years ago when humans began to breed animals and process
their milk Fermentation in this case preserves nutrients Milk will spoil relatively quickly but when processed
as cheese it is more stable As for beer the oldest records of brewing are about 6000 years old and were
an integral part of the Sumerian culture Evidence indicates that the Sumerians discovered fermentation by
chance Wine has been produced for about 4500 years and evidence suggests that cultured milk products like
yogurt have existed for at least 4000 years
Using Prokaryotes to Clean up Our Planet Bioremediation
Microbial bioremediation is the use of prokaryotes or microbial metabolism to remove pollutants
Bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals eg pesticides fertilizers that leach from
soil into groundwater and the subsurface Certain toxic metals and oxides such as selenium and arsenic
compounds can also be removed from water by bioremediation The reduction of SeO42 to SeO32 and to Se0
metallic selenium is a method used to remove selenium ions from water Mercury Hg is an example of a toxic
metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation As an active ingredient of some pesticides
mercury is used in industry and is also a byproduct of certain processes such as battery production Methyl
mercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments but it is highly toxic because it
accumulates in living tissues Several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of toxic mercury
into nontoxic forms These bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa can convert Hg2 into Hg0 which is
nontoxic to humans
One of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the
cleanup of oil spills The significance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in
several oil spills in recent years such as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska 1989 Figure 2230 the Prestige
oil spill in Spain 2002 the spill into the Mediterranean from a Lebanon power plant 2006 and more recently
the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico 2010 In the case of oil spills in the ocean ongoing natural bioremediation
tends to occur since there are oilconsuming bacteria in the ocean prior to the spill In addition to these naturally
