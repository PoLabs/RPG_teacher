Introduction
Vertebrates are among the most recognizable organisms of the Animal Kingdom and more than 62000
vertebrate species have been identified The vertebrate species now living represent only a small portion of the
vertebrates that have existed in the past The bestknown extinct vertebrates are the dinosaurs a unique group
of reptiles some of which reached sizes not seen before or after in terrestrial animals In fact they were the
dominant terrestrial animals for 150 million years until most of them died out in a mass extinction near the end of
the Cretaceous period except for the feathered theropod ancestors of modern birds whose direct descendents
now number nearly 10000 species Although it is not known with certainty what caused this mass extinction
not only of dinosaurs but of many other groups of organisms a great deal is known about the anatomy of the
dinosaurs and early birds given the preservation of numerous skeletal elements nests eggs and embryos in
the fossil record
The vertebrates exhibit two major innovations in their evolution from the invertebrate chordates These
innovations may be associated with the whole genome duplications that resulted in a quadruplication of the basic
chordate genome including the Hox gene loci that regulate the placement of structures along the three axes of
the body One of the first major steps was the emergence of the quadrupeds in the form of the amphibians A
second step was the evolution of the amniotic egg which similar to the evolution of pollen and seeds in plants
freed terrestrial animals from their dependence on water for fertilization and embryonic development Within the
amniotes modifications of keratinous epidermal structures have given rise to scales claws hair and feathers
The scales of reptiles sealed their skins against water loss while hair and feathers provided insulation to support
the evolution of endothermy as well as served other functions such as camouflage and mate attraction in the
vertebrate lineages that led to birds and mammals
Currently a number of vertebrate species face extinction primarily due to habitat loss and pollution According
