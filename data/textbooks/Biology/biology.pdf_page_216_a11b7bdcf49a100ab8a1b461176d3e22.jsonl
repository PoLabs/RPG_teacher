energy in the remaining phosphate bond and produces phosphoenolpyruvate PEP
Step 10 The last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase the enzyme in this case is
named for the reverse reaction of pyruvates conversion into PEP and results in the production of a second
ATP molecule by substratelevel phosphorylation and the compound pyruvic acid or its salt form pyruvate
Many enzymes in enzymatic pathways are named for the reverse reactions since the enzyme can catalyze both
forward and reverse reactions these may have been described initially by the reverse reaction that takes place
in vitro under nonphysiological conditions

Outcomes of Glycolysis
Glycolysis begins with glucose and produces two pyruvate molecules four new ATP molecules and two
molecules of NADH Note two ATP molecules are used in the first half of the pathway to prepare the sixcarbon
ring for cleavage so the cell has a net gain of two ATP molecules and two NADH molecules for its use If the
cell cannot catabolize the pyruvate molecules further it will harvest only two ATP molecules from one molecule
of glucose Mature mammalian red blood cells do not have mitochondria and thus are not capable of aerobic
respirationthe process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygenand glycolysis is their
sole source of ATP If glycolysis is interrupted these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodiumpotassium
pumps and eventually they die
The last step in glycolysis will not occur if pyruvate kinase the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of pyruvate
is not available in sufficient quantities In this situation the entire glycolysis pathway will proceed but only two
ATP molecules will be made in the second half Thus pyruvate kinase is a ratelimiting enzyme for glycolysis
73  Oxidation of Pyruvate and the Citric Acid Cycle
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how a circular pathway such as the citric acid cycle fundamentally differs from a linear
biochemical pathway such as glycolysis

Describe how pyruvate the product of glycolysis is prepared for entry into the citric acid cycle
If oxygen is available aerobic respiration will go forward In eukaryotic cells the pyruvate molecules produced
at the end of glycolysis are transported into the mitochondria which are the sites of cellular respiration There
pyruvate is transformed into an acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by a carrier compound called
coenzyme A CoA The resulting compound is called acetyl CoA CoA is derived from vitamin B5 pantothenic
acid Acetyl CoA can be used in a variety of ways by the cell but its major function is to deliver the acetyl group
derived from pyruvate to the next stage of the pathway in glucose catabolism
Breakdown of Pyruvate
In order for pyruvate the product of glycolysis to enter the next pathway it must undergo several changes The
conversion is a threestep process Figure 78
