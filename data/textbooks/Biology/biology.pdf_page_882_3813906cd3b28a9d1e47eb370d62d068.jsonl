common to find specimens such as Quetzalcoatlus with a head and neck region that together was three to four
times as large as the torso In addition unlike the feathered bird wing the reptilian wing had a layer of muscles
connective tissue and blood vessels all reinforced with a webbing of fibrous cords
In contrast to the aerial pterosaurs the dinosaurs were a diverse group of terrestrial reptiles with more than 1000
species classified to date Paleontologists continue to discover new species of dinosaurs Some dinosaurs were
quadrupeds Figure 2926 others were bipeds Some were carnivorous whereas others were herbivorous
Dinosaurs laid eggs and a number of nests containing fossilized eggs with intact embryos have been found It
is not known with certainty whether dinosaurs were homeotherms or facultative endotherms However given that
modern birds are endothermic the dinosaurs that were the immediate ancestors to birds likely were endothermic
as well Some fossil evidence exists for dinosaurian parental care and comparative biology supports this
hypothesis since the archosaur birds and crocodilians both display extensive parental care
Figure 2926 Ornithischian and saurischian Dinosaurs Edmontonia was an armored dinosaur that lived in the Late
Cretaceous period 1455 to 656 million years ago Herrerrasaurus and Eoraptor b were late Triassic saurischian
dinosaurs dating to about 230 million years ago credit a Mariana Ruiz Villareal b Zach Tirrell from Plymouth USA
Dino Origins
Dinosaurs dominated the Mesozoic era which was known as the Age of Reptiles The dominance of dinosaurs
lasted until the end of the Cretaceous the last period of the Mesozoic era The CretaceousTertiary extinction
resulted in the loss of most of the largebodied animals of the Mesozoic era Birds are the only living descendants
of one of the major clades of theropod dinosaurs

Modern Reptiles
Class Reptilia includes many diverse species that are classified into four living clades There are the 25 species
of Crocodilia two species of Sphenodontia approximately 9200 Squamata species and about 325 species of
Testudines
Crocodilia
Crocodilia small lizard arose as a distinct lineage by the middle Triassic extant species include alligators
crocodiles gharials and caimans Crocodilians Figure 2927 live throughout the tropics and subtropics of
Africa South America Southern Florida Asia and Australia They are found in freshwater saltwater and
brackish habitats such as rivers and lakes and spend most of their time in water Crocodiles are descended
from terrestrial reptiles and can still walk and run well on land They often move on their bellies in a swimming
motion propelled by alternate movements of their legs However some species can lift their bodies off the
ground pulling their legs in under the body with their feet rotated to face forward This mode of locomotion
takes a lot of energy and seems to be used primarily to clear ground obstacles Amazingly some crocodiles
can also gallop pushing off with their hind legs and moving their hind and forelegs alternately in pairs Galloping
