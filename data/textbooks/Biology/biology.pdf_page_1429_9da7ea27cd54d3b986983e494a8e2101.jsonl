become limited the growth rate decreases Finally growth levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment
with little change in population size over time
Role of Intraspecific Competition
The logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and
thus an equal chance for survival For plants the amount of water sunlight nutrients and the space to grow are
the important resources whereas in animals important resources include food water shelter nesting space
and mates
In the real world phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will
be better adapted to their environment than others The resulting competition between population members of
the same species for resources is termed intraspecific competition intra  within specific  species
Intraspecific competition for resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying
capacityresources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need However as population size
increases this competition intensifies In addition the accumulation of waste products can reduce an
environments carrying capacity
Examples of Logistic Growth
Yeast a microscopic fungus used to make bread and alcoholic beverages exhibits the classical Sshaped curve
when grown in a test tube Figure 4510a Its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients In the
real world however there are variations to this idealized curve Examples in wild populations include sheep
and harbor seals Figure 4510b In both examples the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short
periods of time and then falls below the carrying capacity afterwards This fluctuation in population size continues
to occur as the population oscillates around its carrying capacity Still even with this oscillation the logistic model
is confirmed
