Introduction
An incredible variety of seedless plants populates the terrestrial landscape Mosses may grow on a tree trunk
and horsetails may display their jointed stems and spindly leaves across the forest floor Today seedless
plants represent only a small fraction of the plants in our environment yet 300 million years ago seedless
plants dominated the landscape and grew in the enormous swampy forests of the Carboniferous period Their
decomposition created large deposits of coal that we mine today
Current evolutionary thought holds that all plantssome green algae as well as land plantsare monophyletic
that is they are descendants of a single common ancestor The evolutionary transition from water to land
imposed severe constraints on plants They had to develop strategies to avoid drying out to disperse
reproductive cells in air for structural support and for capturing and filtering sunlight While seed plants have
developed adaptations that allow them to populate even the most arid habitats on Earth full independence from
water did not happen in all plants Most seedless plants still require a moist environment for reproduction
