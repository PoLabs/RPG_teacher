Figure 194 Genetic drift in a population can lead to eliminating an allele from a population by chance In this
example rabbits with the brown coat color allele B are dominant over rabbits with the white coat color allele b
In the first generation the two alleles occur with equal frequency in the population resulting in p and q values
of 5 Only half of the individuals reproduce resulting in a second generation with p and q values of 7 and
3 respectively Only two individuals in the second generation reproduce and by chance these individuals are
homozygous dominant for brown coat color As a result in the third generation the recessive b allele is lost
Do you think genetic drift would happen more quickly on an island or on the mainland
Small populations are more susceptible to the forces of genetic drift Large populations alternatively are
buffered against the effects of chance If one individual of a population of 10 individuals happens to die at a
