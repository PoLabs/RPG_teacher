individual organisms evolve The statement is shorthand for a population evolves in response to a changing
environment However a second misunderstanding may arise by interpreting the statement to mean that
the evolution is somehow intentional A changed environment results in some individuals in the population
those with particular phenotypes benefiting and therefore producing proportionately more offspring than other
phenotypes This results in change in the population if the characteristics are genetically determined
It is also important to understand that the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population
and does not arise in response to an environmental change For example applying antibiotics to a population of
bacteria will over time select a population of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics The resistance which a
gene causes did not arise by mutation because of applying the antibiotic The gene for resistance was already
present in the bacterias gene pool likely at a low frequency The antibiotic which kills the bacterial cells without
the resistance gene strongly selects individuals that are resistant since these would be the only ones that
survived and divided Experiments have demonstrated that mutations for antibiotic resistance do not arise as a
result of antibiotic
In a larger sense evolution is not goal directed Species do not become better over time They simply track
their changing environment with adaptations that maximize their reproduction in a particular environment at a
particular time Evolution has no goal of making faster bigger more complex or even smarter species despite
the commonness of this kind of language in popular discourse What characteristics evolve in a species are a
function of the variation present and the environment both of which are constantly changing in a nondirectional
way A trait that fits in one environment at one time may well be fatal at some point in the future This holds
equally well for insect and human species
182  Formation of New Species
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Define species and describe how scientists identify species as different

Describe genetic variables that lead to speciation

Identify prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive barriers

Explain allopatric and sympatric speciation

Describe adaptive radiation
Although all life on earth shares various genetic similarities only certain organisms combine genetic information
by sexual reproduction and have offspring that can then successfully reproduce Scientists call such organisms
members of the same biological species
Species and the Ability to Reproduce
A species is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile viable offspring According to
this definition one species is distinguished from another when in nature it is not possible for matings between
individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring
Members of the same species share both external and internal characteristics which develop from their
DNA The closer relationship two organisms share the more DNA they have in common just like people
and their families Peoples DNA is likely to be more like their father or mothers DNA than their cousin or
grandparents DNA Organisms of the same species have the highest level of DNA alignment and therefore
share characteristics and behaviors that lead to successful reproduction
Species appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate For example even though
domestic dogs Canis lupus familiaris display phenotypic differences such as size build and coat most dogs
can interbreed and produce viable puppies that can mature and sexually reproduce Figure 189
