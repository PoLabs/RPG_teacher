can refer to the water potential of the soil water soil root water root stem water stem leaf water
leaf or the water in the atmosphere atmosphere whichever aqueous system is under consideration As the
individual components change they raise or lower the total water potential of a system When this happens
water moves to equilibrate moving from the system or compartment with a higher water potential to the system
or compartment with a lower water potential This brings the difference in water potential between the two
systems  back to zero   0 Therefore for water to move through the plant from the soil to the air a
process called transpiration soil must be  root  stem  leaf  atmosphere
Water only moves in response to  not in response to the individual components However because the
individual components influence the total system by manipulating the individual components especially s a
plant can control water movement
Solute Potential
Solute potential s also called osmotic potential is negative in a plant cell and zero in distilled water Typical
values for cell cytoplasm are 05 to 10 MPa Solutes reduce water potential resulting in a negative w by
consuming some of the potential energy available in the water Solute molecules can dissolve in water because
water molecules can bind to them via hydrogen bonds a hydrophobic molecule like oil which cannot bind to
water cannot go into solution The energy in the hydrogen bonds between solute molecules and water is no
longer available to do work in the system because it is tied up in the bond In other words the amount of available
potential energy is reduced when solutes are added to an aqueous system Thus s decreases with increasing
solute concentration Because s is one of the four components of system or total a decrease in s will cause
a decrease in total The internal water potential of a plant cell is more negative than pure water because of
the cytoplasms high solute content Figure 3032 Because of this difference in water potential water will move
from the soil into a plants root cells via the process of osmosis This is why solute potential is sometimes called
osmotic potential
Plant cells can metabolically manipulate s and by extension total by adding or removing solute molecules
Therefore plants have control over total via their ability to exert metabolic control over s
