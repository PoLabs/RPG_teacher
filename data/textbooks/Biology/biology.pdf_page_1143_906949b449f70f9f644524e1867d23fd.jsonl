Figure 3619 Rods and cones are photoreceptors in the retina Rods respond in low light and can detect only shades
of gray Cones respond in intense light and are responsible for color vision credit modification of work by Piotr Sliwa
The fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision The fovea has a high
density of cones When you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light the eyes orient so
that the objects image falls on the fovea However when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim
light the object can be better viewed by the peripheral vision because it is the rods at the edges of the retina
rather than the cones at the center that operate better in low light In humans cones far outnumber rods in the
fovea

Transduction of Light
The rods and cones are the site of transduction of light to a neural signal Both rods and cones contain
photopigments In vertebrates the main photopigment rhodopsin has two main parts Figure 3620 an opsin
which is a membrane protein in the form of a cluster of helices that span the membrane and retinala
molecule that absorbs light When light hits a photoreceptor it causes a shape change in the retinal altering its
structure from a bent cis form of the molecule to its linear trans isomer This isomerization of retinal activates
the rhodopsin starting a cascade of events that ends with the closing of Na channels in the membrane of the
