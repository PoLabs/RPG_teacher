83 Using Light Energy to Make Organic Molecules
Using the energy carriers formed in the first steps of photosynthesis the lightindependent reactions or the
Calvin cycle take in CO2 from the atmosphere An enzyme RuBisCO catalyzes a reaction with CO2 and
another organic compound RuBP After three cycles a threecarbon molecule of G3P leaves the cycle to
become part of a carbohydrate molecule The remaining G3P molecules stay in the cycle to be regenerated
into RuBP which is then ready to react with more CO2 Photosynthesis forms an energy cycle with the process
of cellular respiration Because plants contain both chloroplasts and mitochondria they rely upon both
photosynthesis and respiration for their ability to function in both the light and dark and to be able to
interconvert essential metabolites
