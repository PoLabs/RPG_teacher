KEY TERMS
immunity that has memory and occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen
or a vaccination
attraction of molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules
immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibodymediated immune
response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen
protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen also known as an
immunoglobulin
foreign or nonself protein that triggers the immune response
immune cell that detects engulfs and informs the adaptive immune response
about an infection by presenting the processed antigen on the cell surface
antibody that incorrectly marks self components as foreign and stimulates the immune
response
inappropriate immune response to host cells or selfantigens
type of hypersensitivity to self antigens
total binding strength of a multivalent antibody with antigen
lymphocyte that matures in the bone marrow and differentiates into antibodysecreting plasma cells
leukocyte that releases chemicals usually involved in the inflammatory response
adaptive immune response that is carried out by T cells
activation of B cells corresponding to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of
that variant
array of approximately 20 soluble proteins of the innate immune system that enhance
phagocytosis bore holes in pathogens and recruit lymphocytes enhances the adaptive response when
antibodies are produced
binding of an antibody to an epitope corresponding to an antigen that is different from the one
the antibody was raised against
chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation proliferation gene expression and cell
trafficking to effect immune responses
adaptive immune cell that directly kills infected cells via perforin and
granzymes and releases cytokines to enhance the immune response
immune cell that processes antigen material and presents it on the surface of other cells to induce
an immune response
lymphocyte that has differentiated such as a B cell plasma cell or cytotoxic T lymphocyte
leukocyte that responds to parasites and is involved in the allergic response
small component of an antigen that is specifically recognized by antibodies B cells and T cells the
antigenic determinant
protease that enters target cells through perforin and induces apoptosis in the target cells used by
NK cells and killer T cells
cell of the adaptive immune system that binds APCs via MHC II molecules and
