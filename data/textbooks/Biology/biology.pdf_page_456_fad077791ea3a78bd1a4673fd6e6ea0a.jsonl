additional sites as promoterproximal elements because they are usually found within a few hundred base pairs
upstream of the transcriptional start site Examples of these elements are the CAAT box with the consensus
sequence 5CCAAT3 and the GC box with the consensus sequence 5GGGCGG3 Specific transcription
factors can bind to these promoterproximal elements to regulate gene transcription A given gene may have its
own combination of these specific transcriptionfactor binding sites There are hundreds of transcription factors
in a cell each of which binds specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif When transcription factors bind to
the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene it is referred to as a cisacting element because it is on the
same chromosome just next to the gene Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the
proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed
Enhancers and Transcription
In some eukaryotic genes there are additional regions that help increase or enhance transcription These
regions called enhancers are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance They can be located upstream
of a gene within the coding region of the gene downstream of a gene or may be thousands of nucleotides
away
Enhancer regions are binding sequences or sites for specific transcription factors When a protein transcription
factor binds to its enhancer sequence the shape of the protein changes allowing it to interact with proteins at
the promotor site However since the enhancer region may be distant from the promoter the DNA must bend to
allow the proteins at the two sites to come into contact DNA bending proteins help to bend the DNA and bring
the enhancer and promoter regions together Figure 169 This shape change allows for the interaction of the
specific activator proteins bound to the enhancers with the general transcription factors bound to the promoter
region and the RNA polymerase
Figure 169 Interaction between proteins at the promoter and enhancer sites An enhancer is a DNA sequence that
promotes transcription Each enhancer is made up of short DNA sequences called distal control elements Activators
bound to the distal control elements interact with mediator proteins and transcription factors Two different genes may
have the same promoter but different distal control elements enabling differential gene expression
Turning Genes Off Transcriptional Repressors
Like prokaryotic cells eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent transcription Transcriptional repressors
can bind to promoter or enhancer regions and block transcription Like the transcriptional activators repressors
respond to external stimuli to prevent the binding of activating transcription factors
