285  Superphylum Ecdysozoa Nematodes and
Tardigrades
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the structural organization of nematodes

Describe the importance of Caenorhabditis elegans in research

Describe the features of Tardigrades
Superphylum Ecdysozoa
The superphylum Ecdysozoa contains an incredibly large number of species This is because it contains two of
the most diverse animal groups phylum Nematoda the roundworms and phylum Arthropoda the arthropods
The most prominent distinguishing feature of ecdysozoans is the cuticlea tough but flexible exoskeleton that
protects these animals from water loss predators and other dangers of the external environment One small
phylum within the Ecdysozoa with exceptional resistance to desiccation and other environmental hazards is
the Tardigrada The nematodes tardigrades and arthropods all belong to the superphylum Ecdysozoa which is
believed to be monophyletica clade consisting of all evolutionary descendants from one common ancestor
All members of this superphylum periodically go through a molting process that culminates in ecdysisthe
actual shedding of the old exoskeleton The term ecdysis translates roughly as take off or strip During the
molting process old cuticle is replaced by a new cuticle which is secreted beneath it and which will last until
the next growth period
Phylum Nematoda
The Nematoda like other members of the superphylum Ecdysozoa are triploblastic and possess an embryonic
mesoderm that is sandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm They are also bilaterally symmetrical
meaning that a longitudinal section will divide them into right and left sides that are superficially symmetrical In
contrast with flatworms nematodes are pseudocoelomates and show a tubular morphology and circular cross
section Nematodes include both freeliving and parasitic forms
In 1914 NA Cobb said In short if all the matter in the universe except the nematodes were swept away our
world would still be dimly recognizable and if as disembodied spirits we could then investigate it we should find
its mountains hills vales rivers lakes and oceans represented by a thin film of nematodes To paraphrase
Cobb nematodes are so abundant that if all the nonnematode matter of the biosphere were removed there
would still remain a shadow of the former world outlined by nematodes

The phylum Nematoda includes more
than 28000 species with an estimated 16000 being parasitic in nature However nematologists believe there
may be over one million unclassified species
The name Nematoda is derived from the Greek word Nemos which means thread and includes all true
roundworms Nematodes are present in all habitats typically with each species occurring in great abundance
The freeliving nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been extensively used as a model system for many
different avenues of biological inquiry in laboratories all over the world
Morphology
The cylindrical body form of the nematodes is seen in Figure 2832 These animals have a complete digestive
system with a distinct mouth and anus whereas only one opening is present in the digestive tract of flatworms
The mouth opens into a muscular pharynx and intestine which leads to a rectum and anal opening at the
posterior end The epidermis can be either a single layer of cells or a syncytiuma multinucleated tissue that
in this case is formed by the fusion of many single cells The cuticle of nematodes is rich in collagen and a
polymer called chitin which forms a protective armor outside the epidermis The cuticle extends into both ends
of the digestive tract the pharynx and rectum In the head an anterior mouth opening is composed of three
or six lips as well as teeth derived from the cuticle in some species Some nematodes may present other
modifications of the cuticle such as rings head shields or warts These external rings however do not reflect
true internal body segmentation which as we have seen is a hallmark of phylum Annelida The attachment of
