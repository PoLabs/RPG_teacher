When the sperm have developed flagella and are nearly mature they leave the testicles and enter the
epididymis shown in Figure 438 This structure resembles a comma and lies along the top and posterior portion
of the testes it is the site of sperm maturation The sperm leave the epididymis and enter the vas deferens
or ductus deferens which carries the sperm behind the bladder and forms the ejaculatory duct with the duct
from the seminal vesicles During a vasectomy a section of the vas deferens is removed preventing sperm from
being passed out of the body during ejaculation and preventing fertilization
Semen is a mixture of sperm and spermatic duct secretions about 10 percent of the total and fluids from
accessory glands that contribute most of the semens volume Sperm are haploid cells consisting of a flagellum
as a tail a neck that contains the cells energyproducing mitochondria and a head that contains the genetic
material Figure 439 shows a micrograph of human sperm as well as a diagram of the parts of the sperm An
acrosome is found at the top of the head of the sperm This structure contains lysosomal enzymes that can digest
the protective coverings that surround the egg to help the sperm penetrate and fertilize the egg An ejaculate will
contain from two to five milliliters of fluid with from 50120 million sperm per milliliter

The bulk of the semen comes from the accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system These
are the seminal vesicles the prostate gland and the bulbourethral gland all of which are illustrated in Figure
438 The seminal vesicles are a pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder The
glands make a solution that is thick yellowish and alkaline As sperm are only motile in an alkaline environment
a basic pH is important to reverse the acidity of the vaginal environment The solution also contains mucus
fructose a sperm mitochondrial nutrient a coagulating enzyme ascorbic acid and localacting hormones called
prostaglandins The seminal vesicle glands account for 60 percent of the bulk of semen
The penis illustrated in Figure 438 is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as
a copulatory organ during intercourse The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the
length of the organ These consist of a pair of tubes on the dorsal side called the corpus cavernosum and a
single tube of tissue on the ventral side called the corpus spongiosum This tissue will become engorged with
blood becoming erect and hard in preparation for intercourse The organ is inserted into the vagina culminating
with an ejaculation During intercourse the smooth muscle sphincters at the opening to the renal bladder close
and prevent urine from entering the penis An orgasm is a twostage process first glands and accessory
organs connected to the testes contract then semen containing sperm is expelled through the urethra during
ejaculation After intercourse the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes flaccid
The walnutshaped prostate gland surrounds the urethra the connection to the urinary bladder It has a series
of short ducts that directly connect to the urethra The gland is a mixture of smooth muscle and glandular tissue
The muscle provides much of the force needed for ejaculation to occur The glandular tissue makes a thin milky
fluid that contains citrate a nutrient enzymes and prostate specific antigen PSA PSA is a proteolytic enzyme
that helps to liquefy the ejaculate several minutes after release from the male Prostate gland secretions account
for about 30 percent of the bulk of semen
The bulbourethral gland or Cowpers gland releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen
It neutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine This usually accounts for a couple of drops
of fluid in the total ejaculate and may contain a few sperm Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before
ejaculation to prevent pregnancy may not work if sperm are present in the bulbourethral gland secretions The
location and functions of the male reproductive organs are summarized in Table 431
