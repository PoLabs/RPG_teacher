the celluloselike carbohydrate material called the tunic which covers the outer body of tunicates Although
tunicates are classified as chordates the adults do not have a notochord a dorsal hollow nerve cord or a post
anal tail although they do have pharyngeal slits and an endostyle The tadpole larval form however possesses
all five structures Most tunicates are hermaphrodites their larvae hatch from eggs inside the adult tunicates
body After hatching a tunicate larva possessing all five chordate features swims for a few days until it finds
a suitable surface on which it can attach usually in a dark or shaded location It then attaches via the head to
the surface and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form at which point the notochord nerve cord and
tail disappear leaving the pharyngeal gill slits and the endostyle as the two remaining features of its chordate
morphology
Figure 295 Urochordate anatomy a This photograph shows a colony of the tunicate Botrylloides violaceus b The
larval stage of the tunicate possesses all of the features characteristic of chordates a notochord a dorsal hollow nerve
cord pharyngeal slits an endostyle and a postanal tail c In the adult stage the notochord nerve cord and tail
disappear leaving just the pharyngeal slits and endostyle credit modification of work by Dann Blackwood USGS
Adult tunicates may be either solitary or colonial forms and some species may reproduce by budding Most
tunicates live a sessile existence on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders However chains of thaliacean
tunicates called salps Figure 296 can swim actively while feeding propelling themselves as they move water
through the pharyngeal slits The primary foods of tunicates are plankton and detritus Seawater enters the
tunicates body through its incurrent siphon Suspended material is filtered out of this water by a mucous net
produced by the endostyle and is passed into the intestine via the action of cilia The anus empties into the
excurrent siphon which expels wastes and water Tunicates are found in shallow ocean waters around the world
