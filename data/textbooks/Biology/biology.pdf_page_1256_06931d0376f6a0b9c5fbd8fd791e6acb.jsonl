muscle connected to the rib cage that contracts upon inspiration
space between the layers of pleura
voice box a short passageway connecting the pharynx and the trachea
measurement of two or more lung volumes how much air can be inhaled from the end of an
expiration to maximal capacity
measurement of air for one lung function normal inhalation or exhalation
complex glycoprotein found in mucus
sticky proteincontaining fluid secretion in the lung that traps particulate matter to be expelled from the
body
opening of the respiratory system to the outside environment
disease such as emphysema and asthma that arises from obstruction of the airways
compliance increases in these diseases
curve depicting the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin
amount of oxygen that can be transported in the blood
amount of pressure exerted by one gas within a mixture of gases
small particle such as dust dirt viral particles and bacteria that are in the air
throat a tube that starts in the internal nares and runs partway down the neck where it opens into the
esophagus and the larynx
also physiological shunt region of the lung that lacks proper ventilationperfusion
due to a physiological change in the lung like inflammation or edema
tissue layer that surrounds the lungs and lines the interior of the thoracic cavity
painful inflammation of the pleural tissue layers
also main bronchus region of the airway within the lung that attaches to the trachea and
bifurcates to each lung where it branches into secondary bronchi
process of opening airways that normally remain closed when the cardiac output increases
amount of air remaining in the lung after a maximal expiration
measurement of lung obstruction
terminal portion of the bronchiole tree that is attached to the terminal bronchioles and
alveoli ducts alveolar sacs and alveoli
disease that arises from a deficient amount of surfactant
ratio of carbon dioxide production to each oxygen molecule consumed
number of breaths per minute
disease that results from a restriction and decreased compliance of the alveoli respiratory
distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis are examples
genetic disorder that affects the shape of red blood cells and their ability to transport oxygen
and move through capillaries
