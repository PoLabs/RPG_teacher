Figure 461 In the southwestern United States rainy weather causes an increase in production of pinyon nuts causing
the deer mouse population to explode Deer mice may carry a virus called Sin Nombre a hantavirus that causes
respiratory disease in humans and has a high fatality rate In 19921993 wet El Nio weather caused a Sin Nombre
epidemic Navajo healers who were aware of the link between this disease and weather predicted the outbreak

Introduction
In 1993 an interesting example of ecosystem dynamics occurred when a rare lung disease struck inhabitants
of the southwestern United States This disease had an alarming rate of fatalities killing more than half of
early patients many of whom were Native Americans These formerly healthy young adults died from complete
respiratory failure The disease was unknown and the Centers for Disease Control CDC the United States
government agency responsible for managing potential epidemics was brought in to investigate The scientists
could have learned about the disease had they known to talk with the Navajo healers who lived in the area and
who had observed the connection between rainfall and mice populations thereby predicting the 1993 outbreak
The cause of the disease determined within a few weeks by the CDC investigators was the hantavirus known
as Sin Nombre the virus with no name With insights from traditional Navajo medicine scientists were able
to characterize the disease rapidly and institute effective health measures to prevent its spread This example
illustrates the importance of understanding the complexities of ecosystems and how they respond to changes in
the environment
461  Ecology of Ecosystems
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the basic ecosystem types

Explain the methods that ecologists use to study ecosystem structure and dynamics

Identify the different methods of ecosystem modeling

Differentiate between food chains and food webs and recognize the importance of each
