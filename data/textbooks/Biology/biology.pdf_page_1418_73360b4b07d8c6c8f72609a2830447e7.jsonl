451  Population Demography
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how ecologists measure population size and density

Describe three different patterns of population distribution

Use life tables to calculate mortality rates

Describe the three types of survivorship curves and relate them to specific populations
Populations are dynamic entities Populations consist all of the species living within a specific area and
populations fluctuate based on a number of factors seasonal and yearly changes in the environment natural
disasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions and competition for resources between and within species
The statistical study of population dynamics demography uses a series of mathematical tools to investigate
how populations respond to changes in their biotic and abiotic environments Many of these tools were originally
designed to study human populations For example life tables which detail the life expectancy of individuals
within a population were initially developed by life insurance companies to set insurance rates In fact while the
term demographics is commonly used when discussing humans all living populations can be studied using
this approach
Population Size and Density
The study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species
exist and how closely associated they are with each other Within a particular habitat a population can be
characterized by its population size N the total number of individuals and its population density the number
of individuals within a specific area or volume Population size and density are the two main characteristics used
to describe and understand populations For example populations with more individuals may be more stable
than smaller populations based on their genetic variability and thus their potential to adapt to the environment
Alternatively a member of a population with low population density more spread out in the habitat might have
more difficulty finding a mate to reproduce compared to a population of higher density As is shown in Figure
452 smaller organisms tend to be more densely distributed than larger organisms
