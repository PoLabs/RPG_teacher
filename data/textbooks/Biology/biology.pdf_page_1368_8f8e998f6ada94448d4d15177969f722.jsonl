considered permanent prevention while other methods are reversible and provide shortterm contraception
Termination of an existing pregnancy can be spontaneous or voluntary Spontaneous termination is a
miscarriage and usually occurs very early in the pregnancy usually within the first few weeks This occurs when
the fetus cannot develop properly and the gestation is naturally terminated Voluntary termination of a pregnancy
is an abortion Laws regulating abortion vary between states and tend to view fetal viability as the criteria for
allowing or preventing the procedure
Infertility
Infertility is the inability to conceive a child or carry a child to birth About 75 percent of causes of infertility
can be identified these include diseases such as sexually transmitted diseases that can cause scarring of the
reproductive tubes in either men or women or developmental problems frequently related to abnormal hormone
levels in one of the individuals Inadequate nutrition especially starvation can delay menstruation Stress can
also lead to infertility Shortterm stress can affect hormone levels while longterm stress can delay puberty and
cause less frequent menstrual cycles Other factors that affect fertility include toxins such as cadmium tobacco
smoking marijuana use gonadal injuries and aging
If infertility is identified several assisted reproductive technologies ART are available to aid conception A
common type of ART is in vitro fertilization IVF where an egg and sperm are combined outside the body and
then placed in the uterus Eggs are obtained from the woman after extensive hormonal treatments that prepare
mature eggs for fertilization and prepare the uterus for implantation of the fertilized egg Sperm are obtained from
the man and they are combined with the eggs and supported through several cell divisions to ensure viability of
the zygotes When the embryos have reached the eightcell stage one or more is implanted into the womans
uterus If fertilization is not accomplished by simple IVF a procedure that injects the sperm into an egg can
be used This is called intracytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI and is shown in Figure 4322 IVF procedures
produce a surplus of fertilized eggs and embryos that can be frozen and stored for future use The procedures
can also result in multiple births

436  Fertilization and Early Embryonic Development
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss how fertilization occurs

Explain how the embryo forms from the zygote

Discuss the role of cleavage and gastrulation in animal development
The process in which an organism develops from a singlecelled zygote to a multicellular organism is complex
and wellregulated The early stages of embryonic development are also crucial for ensuring the fitness of the
