PHYSIOLOGY
Figure 301 A locust leaf consists of leaflets arrayed along a central midrib Each leaflet is a complex photosynthetic
machine exquisitely adapted to capture sunlight and carbon dioxide An intricate vascular system supplies the leaf
with water and minerals and exports the products of photosynthesis credit modification of work by Todd Petit

Introduction
Plants are as essential to human existence as land water and air Without plants our daytoday lives would be
impossible because without oxygen from photosynthesis aerobic life cannot be sustained From providing food
and shelter to serving as a source of medicines oils perfumes and industrial products plants provide humans
with numerous valuable resources
When you think of plants most of the organisms that come to mind are vascular plants These plants have
tissues that conduct food and water and they have seeds Seed plants are divided into gymnosperms and
angiosperms Gymnosperms include the needleleaved conifersspruce fir and pineas well as less familiar
plants such as ginkgos and cycads Their seeds are not enclosed by a fleshy fruit Angiosperms also called
flowering plants constitute the majority of seed plants They include broadleaved trees such as maple oak
and elm vegetables such as potatoes lettuce and carrots grasses and plants known for the beauty of their
flowers roses irises and daffodils for example
While individual plant species are unique all share a common structure a plant body consisting of stems
roots and leaves They all transport water minerals and sugars produced through photosynthesis through the
plant body in a similar manner All plant species also respond to environmental factors such as light gravity
