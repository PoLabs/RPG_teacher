We call the selection pressures on males and females to obtain matings sexual selection It can result in
developing secondary sexual characteristics that do not benefit the individuals likelihood of survival but help
to maximize its reproductive success Sexual selection can be so strong that it selects traits that are actually
detrimental to the individuals survival Think once again about the peacocks tail While it is beautiful and the
male with the largest most colorful tail is more likely to win the female it is not the most practical appendage In
addition to greater visibility to predators it makes the males slower in their attempted escapes There is some
evidence that this risk is why females like the big tails in the first place The speculation is that large tails carry
risk and only the best males survive that risk the bigger the tail the more fit the male We call this the handicap
principle
The good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient
metabolism or their ability to fight disease Females then choose males with the most impressive traits because
it signals their genetic superiority which they will then pass on to their offspring Although one may argue that
females should not be picky because it will likely reduce their number of offspring if better males father more fit
offspring it may be beneficial Fewer healthier offspring may increase the chances of survival more than many
weaker offspring
In 1915 biologist Ronald Fisher proposed another model of sexual selection the Fisherian runaway model
httpopenstaxcollegeorglsexual_select  which suggests that selection of certain traits is a result of
sexual preference
In both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis the trait is an honest signal of the males quality
thus giving females a way to find the fittest mates males that will pass the best genes to their offspring
No Perfect Organism
Natural selection is a driving force in evolution and can generate populations that are better adapted to
survive and successfully reproduce in their environments However natural selection cannot produce the perfect
organism Natural selection can only select on existing variation in the population It does not create anything
from scratch Thus it is limited by a populations existing genetic variance and whatever new alleles arise
through mutation and gene flow
Natural selection is also limited because it works at the individual not allele level and some alleles are
linked due to their physical proximity in the genome making them more likely to pass on together linkage
disequilibrium Any given individual may carry some beneficial and some unfavorable alleles It is the alleles
net effect or the organisms fitness upon which natural selection can act As a result good alleles can be lost
if individuals who carry them also have several overwhelmingly bad alleles Likewise bad alleles can be kept if
individuals who have enough good alleles to result in an overall fitness benefit carry them
