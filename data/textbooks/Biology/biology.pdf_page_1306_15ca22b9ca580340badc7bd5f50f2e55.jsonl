KEY TERMS
arteriole that branches from the cortical radiate artery and enters the glomerulus
compound made of one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms
describes an animal that excretes ammonia as the primary waste material
enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II
product in the reninangiotensinaldosterone pathway
molecule that affects different organs to increase blood pressure
hormone that prevents the loss of water
agent that prevents cell destruction by reactive oxygen species
artery that branches from the interlobar artery and arches over the base of the renal pyramids
part of the loop of Henle that ascends from the renal medulla to the renal cortex
estimate of urea in the blood and an indicator of kidney function
structure that encloses the glomerulus
structure that connects the renal pelvis to the renal medulla
outer layer of an organ like the kidney or adrenal gland
nephron that lies in the renal cortex
artery that radiates from the arcuate arteries into the renal cortex
peritubular capillary network that allows exchange of solutes and water from the
renal tubules
osmotic gradient in the renal medulla that is responsible for concentration of urine
part of the loop of Henle that descends from the renal cortex into the renal medulla
part of the renal tubule that is the most distant from the glomerulus
arteriole that exits from the glomerulus
solute that breaks down into ions when dissolved in water
also protonephridia excretory cell found in flatworms
filtration of blood in the glomerular capillary network into the glomerulus
amount of filtrate formed by the glomerulus per minute
part of the renal corpuscle that contains the capillary network
region in the renal pelvis where blood vessels nerves and ureters bunch before entering or exiting the
kidney
one of the main veins in the human body
artery that branches from the segmental artery and travels in between the renal lobes
cell in the afferent and efferent arterioles that responds to stimuli from the macula densa
