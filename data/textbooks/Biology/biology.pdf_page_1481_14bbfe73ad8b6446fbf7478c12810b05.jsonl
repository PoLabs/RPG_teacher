great photosynthetic capability and dominate other plants in this ecosystem to obtain sunlight Even in smaller
numbers primary producers in forests are still capable of supporting other trophic levels
Another way to visualize ecosystem structure is with pyramids of biomass This pyramid measures the amount
of energy converted into living tissue at the different trophic levels Using the Silver Springs ecosystem example
this data exhibits an upright biomass pyramid Figure 4610 whereas the pyramid from the English Channel
example is inverted The plants primary producers of the Silver Springs ecosystem make up a large percentage
of the biomass found there However the phytoplankton in the English Channel example make up less biomass
than the primary consumers the zooplankton As with inverted pyramids of numbers this inverted pyramid
is not due to a lack of productivity from the primary producers but results from the high turnover rate of
the phytoplankton The phytoplankton are consumed rapidly by the primary consumers thus minimizing their
biomass at any particular point in time However phytoplankton reproduce quickly thus they are able to support
the rest of the ecosystem
Pyramid ecosystem modeling can also be used to show energy flow through the trophic levels Notice that
these numbers are the same as those used in the energy flow compartment diagram in Figure 468 Pyramids
of energy are always upright and an ecosystem without sufficient primary productivity cannot be supported
All types of ecological pyramids are useful for characterizing ecosystem structure However in the study of
energy flow through the ecosystem pyramids of energy are the most consistent and representative models of
ecosystem structure Figure 4610
Figure 4610 Ecological pyramids depict the a biomass b number of organisms and c energy in each trophic
level
Pyramids depicting the number of organisms or biomass may be inverted upright or even diamondshaped
Energy pyramids however are always upright Why
Consequences of Food Webs Biological Magnification
One of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification
Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of persistent toxic substances in organisms at each trophic
