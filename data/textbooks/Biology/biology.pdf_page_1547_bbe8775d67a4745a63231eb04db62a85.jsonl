24 Pinacocytes
are epitheliallike cells form the outermost layer of sponges and enclose a jellylike substance called mesohyl In
some sponges porocytes form ostia single tubeshaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into
the spongocoel Choanocytes collar cells are present at various locations depending on the type of sponge but
they always line some space through which water flows and are used in feeding 26 Nematocysts are stinging cells
designed to paralyze prey The nematocysts contain a neurotoxin that renders prey immobile 28 There are two key
differences between Porifera sponges and Cubozoans box jellyfish  gamete production and fertilization strategy
Box jellyfish have separate sexes while a single sponge can produce both types of gametes Box jellyfish also undergo
internal fertilization while sponges reproduce by external fertilization Internal fertilization allows box jellyfish to control
which sperm is used for fertilization and increases the likelihood of ova and spermatozoa meeting 30 Mollusks have
a large muscular foot that may be modified in various ways such as into tentacles but it functions in locomotion
They have a mantle a structure of tissue that covers and encloses the dorsal portion of the animal and secrete the
shell when it is present The mantle encloses the mantle cavity which houses the gills when present excretory
pores anus and gonadopores The coelom of mollusks is restricted to the region around the systemic heart The
main body cavity is a hemocoel Many mollusks have a radula near the mouth that is used for scraping food 32
Cephalopods have a closed circulatory system while other members of the Mollusca phylum have open circulatory
systems Having a closed system allows blood to be moved more efficiently and rapidly through the animal since the
circulation is not limited by diffusion For example this allows the octopus to have a much more complex body plan
with branching tentacles compared to a snail In many cases a closed circulatory system also allows the development
of larger organisms
34 There are nematodes with separate sexes and hermaphrodites in addition to species that
reproduce parthenogentically The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a selffertilizing hermaphrodite sex and a
pure male sex 36 The Arthropoda include the Hexapoda which are mandibulates with six legs the Myriapoda
which are mandibulates with many legs and include the centipedes and millipedes the Crustacea which are mostly
marine mandibulates and the Chelicerata which include the spiders and scorpions and their kin 38 Insects are

the skull but over time this might have been lost 4 B 6 A 8 B 10 D 12 C 14 D 16 D 18 D 20 A 22 B 23 The
characteristic features of the phylum Chordata are a notochord a dorsal hollow nerve cord pharyngeal slits and a
postanal tail 25 Comparison of hagfishes with lampreys shows that the cranium evolved first in early vertebrates as
it is seen in hagfishes which evolved earlier than lampreys This was followed by evolution of the vertebral column a
primitive form of which is seen in lampreys and not in hagfishes 27 A moist environment is required as frog eggs lack
a shell and dehydrate quickly in dry environments 29 Frogs Anura begin their lives as tadpoles organisms restricted
to an aquatic environment that use gills to breathe After metamorphosis most frogs develop lungs and lose their gills
although they will also continue to perform gas exchange through their skin The lungs of an adult frog allow the animal
to move out of the water and become terrestrial This limits competition between adults and tadpoles by opening
new living space and food sources to the adult 31 Lizards differ from snakes by having eyelids external ears and
less kinematic skulls 33 This is suggested by similarities observed between theropod fossils and birds specifically
in the design of the hip and wrist bones as well as the presence of a furcula or wishbone formed by the fusing of
the clavicles 35 Ostriches and penguins are flightless birds but ostriches are entirely terrestrial while penguins dive
and swim in the ocean to find food Therefore penguins and flight birds like terns have similar chest structures with a
keel sternum and relatively large pectoral muscles penguins use their wings to fly through water Conversely since
ostriches move by running they do not have a keel to their sternum They also have smaller pectoral muscles than
would be predicted for a flying bird their size but have larger thigh muscles 37 In some mammals the cerebral cortex
is highly folded allowing for greater surface area than a smooth cortex The optic lobes are divided into two parts in
mammals Eutherian mammals also possess a specialized structure that links the two cerebral hemispheres called
the corpus callosum 39 Archaic Homo sapiens differed from modern humans by having a thick skull and a prominent
brow ridge and lacking a prominent chin

meristem which is a region of meristematic tissue at the base of the leaf blade This is beneficial to the plant because
it can continue to grow even when the tip of the plant is removed by grazing or mowing 29 Stomata allow gases
to enter and exit the plant Guard cells regulate the opening and closing of stomata If these cells did not function
