produced by meiosis within the sporangia and spores can be disseminated through the air or water to potentially
land in more favorable environments If this occurs the spores germinate to form ameboid or flagellate haploid
cells that can combine with each other and produce a diploid zygotic slime mold to complete the life cycle
Figure 2314 Plasmodial slime molds The life cycle of the plasmodial slime mold is shown The brightly colored
plasmodium in the inset photo is a singlecelled multinucleate mass credit modification of work by Dr Jonatha Gott
and the Center for RNA Molecular Biology Case Western Reserve University
The cellular slime molds function as independent amoeboid cells when nutrients are abundant When food is
depleted cellular slime molds aggregate into a mass of cells that behaves as a single unit called a slug Some
cells in the slug contribute to a 23millimeter stalk drying up and dying in the process Cells atop the stalk
form an asexual fruiting body that contains haploid spores Figure 2315 As with plasmodial slime molds the
spores are disseminated and can germinate if they land in a moist environment One representative genus of
the cellular slime molds is Dictyostelium which commonly exists in the damp soil of forests
