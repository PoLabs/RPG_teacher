Figure 237 Phagocytosis The stages of phagocytosis include the engulfment of a food particle the digestion of the
particle using hydrolytic enzymes contained within a lysosome and the expulsion of undigested materials from the cell
Subtypes of heterotrophs called saprobes absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes Some
protists can function as mixotrophs obtaining nutrition by photoautotrophic or heterotrophic routes depending
on whether sunlight or organic nutrients are available
Motility
The majority of protists are motile but different types of protists have evolved varied modes of movement
Figure 238 Some protists have one or more flagella which they rotate or whip Others are covered in rows or
tufts of tiny cilia that they beat in a coordinated manner to swim Still others form cytoplasmic extensions called
pseudopodia anywhere on the cell anchor the pseudopodia to a substrate and pull themselves forward Some
protists can move toward or away from a stimulus a movement referred to as taxis For example movement
toward light termed phototaxis is accomplished by coupling their locomotion strategy with a lightsensing organ
Figure 238 Locomotor organelles in protists Protists use various methods for transportation a Paramecium waves
hairlike appendages called cilia to propel itself b Amoeba uses lobelike pseudopodia to anchor itself to a solid
surface and pull itself forward c Euglena uses a whiplike tail called a flagellum to propel itself
Life Cycles
Protists reproduce by a variety of mechanisms Most undergo some form of asexual reproduction such as binary
fission to produce two daughter cells In protists binary fission can be divided into transverse or longitudinal
depending on the axis of orientation sometimes Paramecium exhibits this method Some protists such as the
true slime molds exhibit multiple fission and simultaneously divide into many daughter cells Others produce tiny
buds that go on to divide and grow to the size of the parental protist
Sexual reproduction involving meiosis and fertilization is common among protists and many protist species
can switch from asexual to sexual reproduction when necessary Sexual reproduction is often associated with
periods when nutrients are depleted or environmental changes occur Sexual reproduction may allow the protist
to recombine genes and produce new variations of progeny some of which may be better suited to surviving
changes in a new or changing environment However sexual reproduction is often associated with resistant
