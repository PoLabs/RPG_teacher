Water has been described as the stuff of life The cells interior is a thick soup in this medium most small
molecules dissolve and diffuse and the majority of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place Desiccation
or drying out is a constant danger for an organism exposed to air Even when parts of a plant are close to a
source of water the aerial structures are likely to dry out Water also provides buoyancy to organisms On land
plants need to develop structural support in a medium that does not give the same lift as water The organism is
also subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation because air does not filter out ultraviolet rays of sunlight
Additionally the male gametes must reach the female gametes using new strategies because swimming is no
longer possible Therefore both gametes and zygotes must be protected from desiccation The successful land
plants developed strategies to deal with all of these challenges Not all adaptations appeared at once Some
species never moved very far from the aquatic environment whereas others went on to conquer the driest
environments on Earth
To balance these survival challenges life on land offers several advantages First sunlight is abundant Water
acts as a filter altering the spectral quality of light absorbed by the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll Second
carbon dioxide is more readily available in air than in water since it diffuses faster in air Third land plants
evolved before land animals therefore until dry land was colonized by animals no predators threatened plant
life This situation changed as animals emerged from the water and fed on the abundant sources of nutrients
in the established flora In turn plants developed strategies to deter predation from spines and thorns to toxic
chemicals
Early land plants like the early land animals did not live very far from an abundant source of water and
developed survival strategies to combat dryness One of these strategies is called tolerance Many mosses for
example can dry out to a brown and brittle mat but as soon as rain or a flood makes water available mosses
will absorb it and are restored to their healthy green appearance Another strategy is to colonize environments
with high humidity where droughts are uncommon Ferns which are considered an early lineage of plants thrive
in damp and cool places such as the understory of temperate forests Later plants moved away from moist or
aquatic environments using resistance to desiccation rather than tolerance These plants like cacti minimize
the loss of water to such an extent they can survive in extremely dry environments
The most successful adaptation solution was the development of new structures that gave plants the advantage
when colonizing new and dry environments Four major adaptations contribute to the success of terrestrial
plants The first adaptation is that the life cycle in all land plants exhibits the alternation of generations a
sporophyte in which the spores are formed and a gametophyte that produces gametes Second is an apical
meristem tissue in roots and shoots Third is the evolution of a waxy cuticle to resist desiccation absent from
some mosses Finally cell walls with lignin to support structures off the ground These adaptations all contribute
to the success of the land plants but are noticeably lacking in the closely related green algaeanother reason
for the debate over their placement in the plant kingdom They are also not all found in the mosses which can
be regarded as representing an intermediate stage in adaptation to land
Alternation of Generations
All sexually reproducing organisms have both haploid and diploid cells in their life cycles In organisms with
haplontic life cycles the haploid stage is dominant while in organisms with a diplontic life cycle the diploid
stage is the dominant life stage Dominant in this context means both the stage in which the organism spends
most of its time and the stage in which most mitotic cell reproduction occursthe multicellular stage In haplontic
life cycles the only diploid cell is the zygote which undergoes immediate meiosis to restore the haploid state
In diplontic life cycles the only haploid cells are the gametes which combine to restore the diploid state at their
earliest convenience Humans for example are diplontic
Alternation of generations describes a life cycle in which an organism has both haploid and diploid multicellular
stages Figure 252 This type of life cycle which is found in all plants is described as haplodiplontic
