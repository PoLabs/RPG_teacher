Figure 35 Glucose galactose and fructose are all hexoses They are structural isomers meaning they have the
same chemical formula C6H12O6 but a different atom arrangement
What kind of sugars are these aldose or ketose
Glucose galactose and fructose are isomeric monosaccharides hexoses meaning they have the same
chemical formula but have slightly different structures Glucose and galactose are aldoses and fructose is a
ketose
Monosaccharides can exist as a linear chain or as ringshaped molecules In aqueous solutions they are usually
in ring forms Figure 36 Glucose in a ring form can have two different hydroxyl group arrangements OH
around the anomeric carbon carbon 1 that becomes asymmetric in the ring formation process If the hydroxyl
group is below carbon number 1 in the sugar it is in the alpha  position and if it is above the plane it is in the
beta  position
