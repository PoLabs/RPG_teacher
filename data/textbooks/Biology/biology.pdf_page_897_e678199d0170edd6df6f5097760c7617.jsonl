Figure 2942 A Philippine tarsier This tarsier Carlito syrichta is one of the smallest primatesabout 5 inches
long from nose to the base of the tail The tail is not shown but is about twice the length of the body Note
the large eyes each of which is about the same size as the animals brain and the long hind legs credit mtoz

Evolution of Primates
The first primatelike mammals are referred to as protoprimates They were roughly similar to squirrels
and tree shrews in size and appearance The existing fossil evidence mostly from North Africa is very
fragmented These protoprimates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes
available Although genetic evidence suggests that primates diverged from other mammals about 85 MYA the
oldest known primatelike mammals with a relatively robust fossil record date to about 65 MYA Fossils like the
protoprimate Plesiadapis although some researchers do not agree that Plesiadapis was a protoprimate had
some features of the teeth and skeleton in common with true primates They were found in North America and
Europe in the Cenozoic and went extinct by the end of the Eocene
The first true primates date to about 55 MYA in the Eocene epoch They were found in North America Europe
Asia and Africa These early primates resembled presentday prosimians such as lemurs Evolutionary changes
continued in these early primates with larger brains and eyes and smaller muzzles being the trend By the end
of the Eocene epoch many of the early prosimian species went extinct due either to cooler temperatures or
competition from the first monkeys
Anthropoid monkeys evolved from prosimians during the Oligocene epoch By 40 million years ago evidence
indicates that monkeys were present in the New World South America and the Old World Africa and Asia
New World monkeys are also called Platyrrhinia reference to their broad noses Figure 2943 Old World
monkeys are called Catarrhinia reference to their narrow downwardpointed noses There is still quite a bit
of uncertainty about the origins of the New World monkeys At the time the platyrrhines arose the continents
of South American and Africa had drifted apart Therefore it is thought that monkeys arose in the Old World
and reached the New World either by drifting on log rafts or by crossing land bridges Due to this reproductive
isolation New World monkeys and Old World monkeys underwent separate adaptive radiations over millions of
years The New World monkeys are all arboreal whereas Old World monkeys include both arboreal and ground
dwelling species The arboreal habits of the New World monkeys are reflected in the possession of prehensile
or grasping tails by most species The tails of Old World monkeys are never prehensile and are often reduced
and some species have ischial callositiesthickened patches of skin on their seats
