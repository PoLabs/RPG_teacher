Figure 2613 Flowers These flowers grow in a botanical garden border in Bellevue WA Flowering plants dominate
terrestrial landscapes The vivid colors of flowers and enticing fragrance of flowers are adaptations to pollination by
animals like insects birds and bats credit Myriam Feldman
The success of angiosperms is due to two novel reproductive structures flowers and fruits The function of
the flower is to ensure pollination often by arthropods as well as to protect a developing embryo The colors
and patterns on flowers offer specific signals to many pollinating insects or birds and bats that have coevolved
with them For example some patterns are visible only in the ultraviolet range of light which can be seen by
arthropod pollinators For some pollinators flowers advertise themselves as a reliable source of nectar Flower
scent also helps to select its pollinators Sweet scents tend to attract bees and butterflies and moths but some
flies and beetles might prefer scents that signal fermentation or putrefaction Flowers also provide protection for
the ovule and developing embryo inside a receptacle The function of the fruit is seed protection and dispersal
Different fruit structures or tissues on fruitsuch as sweet flesh wings parachutes or spines that grabreflect
the dispersal strategies that help spread seeds
Flowers
Flowers are modified leaves or sporophylls organized around a central receptacle Although they vary greatly in
appearance virtually all flowers contain the same structures sepals petals carpels and stamens The peduncle
typically attaches the flower to the plant proper A whorl of sepals collectively called the calyx is located at
the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs
although there are some exceptions For example the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and
three petals that look virtually identical Petals collectively the corolla are located inside the whorl of sepals
and may display vivid colors to attract pollinators Sepals and petals together form the perianth The sexual
organs the female gynoecium and male androecium are located at the center of the flower Typically the sepals
petals and stamens are attached to the receptacle at the base of the gynoecium but the gynoecium may also
be located deeper in the receptacle with the other floral structures attached above it
As illustrated in Figure 2614 the innermost part of a perfect flower is the gynoecium the location in the flower
where the eggs will form The female reproductive unit consists of one or more carpels each of which has a
stigma style and ovary The stigma is the location where the pollen is deposited either by wind or a pollinating
arthropod The sticky surface of the stigma traps pollen grains and the style is a connecting structure through
which the pollen tube will grow to reach the ovary The ovary houses one or more ovules each of which will
ultimately develop into a seed Flower structure is very diverse and carpels may be singular multiple or fused
Multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil The androecium or male reproductive region is composed of multiple
stamens surrounding the central carpel Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a saclike
structure called the anther The filament supports the anther where the microspores are produced by meiosis
and develop into haploid pollen grains or male gametophytes
