the muscles of nematodes differs from that of most animals they have a longitudinal layer only and their direct
attachment to the dorsal and ventral nerve cords creates a strong muscular contraction that results in a whiplike
almost spastic body movement

Excretory System
In nematodes specialized excretory systems are not well developed Nitrogenous wastes largely in the form
of ammonia are released directly across the body wall In some nematodes osmoregulation and salt balance
are performed by simple excretory cells or glands that may be connected to paired canals that release wastes
through an anterior pore In marine nematodes the excretory cells are called renette cells which are unique to
nematodes
Nervous system
Most nematodes have four longitudinal nerve cords that run along the length of the body in dorsal ventral and
lateral positions The ventral nerve cord is better developed than the dorsal and lateral cords Nonetheless
all nerve cords fuse at the anterior end to form a pharyngeal nerve ring around the pharynx which acts as
the head ganglion or the brain of the roundworm A similar fusion forms a posterior ganglion at the tail In C
elegans the nervous system accounts for nearly onethird of the total number of cells in the animal
Reproduction
Nematodes
employ
a
variety
of
reproductive
strategies
ranging
from
monoecious
to
dioecious
to
parthenogenetic depending upon the species C elegans is a mostly monoecious species with both self
fertilizing hermaphrodites and some males In the hermaphrodites ova and sperm develop at different times in
the same gonad Ova are contained in a uterus and amoeboid sperm are contained in a spermatheca sperm
receptacle The uterus has an external opening known as the vulva The female genital pore is near the middle
