environments Science attempts to describe and understand the nature of the universe in whole or in part by
rational means Science has many fields Those fields related to the physical world and its phenomena are
natural sciences
Science can be basic or applied The main goal of basic science is to expand knowledge without any
expectation of shortterm practical application of that knowledge The primary goal of applied research
however is to solve practical problems
Science uses two types of logical reasoning Inductive reasoning uses particular results to produce general
scientific principles Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that predicts results by applying general
principles The common thread throughout scientific research is using the scientific method a stepbased
process that consists of making observations defining a problem posing hypotheses testing these
hypotheses and drawing one or more conclusions The testing uses proper controls Scientists present their
results in peerreviewed scientific papers published in scientific journals A scientific research paper consists of
several welldefined sections introduction materials and methods results and finally a concluding
discussion Review papers summarize the conducted research in a particular field over a period of time
12 Themes and Concepts of Biology
Biology is the science of life All living organisms share several key properties such as order sensitivity or
response to stimuli reproduction growth and development regulation homeostasis and energy processing
Living things are highly organized parts of a hierarchy that includes atoms molecules organelles cells
tissues organs and organ systems In turn biologists group organisms as populations communities
ecosystems and the biosphere The great diversity of life today evolved from lessdiverse ancestral organisms
over billions of years We can use a phylogenetic tree to show evolutionary relationships among organisms
Biology is very broad and includes many branches and subdisciplines Examples include molecular biology
microbiology neurobiology zoology and botany among others

2 Figure 17 Decide if each of the following is an
example of inductive or deductive reasoning
1
All flying birds and insects have wings Birds
and insects flap their wings as they move
through the air Therefore wings enable
flight
2
Insects generally survive mild winters better
than harsh ones Therefore insect pests will
become more problematic if global
temperatures increase
3
Chromosomes the carriers of DNA
separate into daughter cells during cell
division Therefore each daughter cell will
have the same chromosome set as the
mother cell
4
Animals as diverse as humans insects and
wolves all exhibit social behavior Therefore
social behavior must have an evolutionary
advantage
3 Figure 116 Which of the following statements is
false
a
Tissues exist within organs which exist
within organ systems
b
Communities exist within populations which
exist within ecosystems
c
Organelles exist within cells which exist
within tissues
d
Communities exist within ecosystems which
exist in the biosphere
