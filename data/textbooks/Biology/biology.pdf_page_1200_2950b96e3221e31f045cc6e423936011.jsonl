The tarsals are the seven bones of the ankle The ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the
fibula to the foot The metatarsals are the five bones of the foot The phalanges are the 14 bones of the toes
Each toe consists of three phalanges except for the big toe that has only two Figure 3815 Variations exist
in other species for example the horses metacarpals and metatarsals are oriented vertically and do not make
contact with the substrate
Figure 3815 This drawing shows the bones of the human foot and ankle including the metatarsals and the phalanges
Evolution of Body Design for Locomotion on Land
The transition of vertebrates onto land required a number of changes in body design as movement on
land presents a number of challenges for animals that are adapted to movement in water The buoyancy
of water provides a certain amount of lift and a common form of movement by fish is lateral undulations
of the entire body This back and forth movement pushes the body against the water creating forward
movement In most fish the muscles of paired fins attach to girdles within the body allowing for some
control of locomotion As certain fish began moving onto land they retained their lateral undulation form of
locomotion anguilliform However instead of pushing against water their fins or flippers became points of
contact with the ground around which they rotated their bodies
The effect of gravity and the lack of buoyancy on land meant that body weight was suspended on the limbs
leading to increased strengthening and ossification of the limbs The effect of gravity also required changes
to the axial skeleton Lateral undulations of land animal vertebral columns cause torsional strain A firmer
more ossified vertebral column became common in terrestrial tetrapods because it reduces strain while
providing the strength needed to support the bodys weight In later tetrapods the vertebrae began allowing
for vertical motion rather than lateral flexion Another change in the axial skeleton was the loss of a direct
attachment between the pectoral girdle and the head This reduced the jarring to the head caused by the
impact of the limbs on the ground The vertebrae of the neck also evolved to allow movement of the head
independently of the body
The appendicular skeleton of land animals is also different from aquatic animals The shoulders attach to the
pectoral girdle through muscles and connective tissue thus reducing the jarring of the skull Because of a
lateral undulating vertebral column in early tetrapods the limbs were splayed out to the side and movement
occurred by performing pushups The vertebrae of these animals had to move sidetoside in a similar
manner to fish and reptiles This type of motion requires large muscles to move the limbs toward the midline
it was almost like walking while doing pushups and it is not an efficient use of energy Later tetrapods have
their limbs placed under their bodies so that each stride requires less force to move forward This resulted
in decreased adductor muscle size and an increased range of motion of the scapulae This also restricts
movement primarily to one plane creating forward motion rather than moving the limbs upward as well as
forward The femur and humerus were also rotated so that the ends of the limbs and digits were pointed
forward in the direction of motion rather than out to the side By placement underneath the body limbs can
swing forward like a pendulum to produce a stride that is more efficient for moving over land
