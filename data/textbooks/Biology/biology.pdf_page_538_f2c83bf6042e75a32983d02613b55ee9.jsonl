Stabilizing Selection
If natural selection favors an average phenotype selecting against extreme variation the population will undergo
stabilizing selection Figure 198 In a mouse population that live in the woods for example natural selection
is likely to favor mice that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely for predators to spot Assuming
the ground is a fairly consistent shade of brown those mice whose fur is most closely matched to that color
will be most likely to survive and reproduce passing on their genes for their brown coat Mice that carry alleles
that make them a bit lighter or a bit darker will stand out against the ground and be more likely to fall victim to
predation As a result of this selection the populations genetic variance will decrease
Directional Selection
When the environment changes populations will often undergo directional selection Figure 198 which
selects for phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation A classic example of this type of selection
is the evolution of the peppered moth in eighteenth and nineteenthcentury England Prior to the Industrial
Revolution the moths were predominately light in color which allowed them to blend in with the lightcolored
trees and lichens in their environment However as soot began spewing from factories the trees darkened and
the lightcolored moths became easier for predatory birds to spot Over time the frequency of the moths melanic
form increased because they had a higher survival rate in habitats affected by air pollution because their darker
coloration blended with the sooty trees Similarly the hypothetical mouse population may evolve to take on a
different coloration if something were to cause the forest floor where they live to change color The result of this
type of selection is a shift in the populations genetic variance toward the new fit phenotype
In science we sometimes believe some things are true and then new information becomes available
that changes our understanding The peppered moth story is an example some scientists recently have
questioned the facts behind the selection toward darker moths Read this article httpopenstaxcollegeorg

Diversifying Selection
Sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages for natural selection while the
intermediate phenotypes are on average less fit Scientists call this diversifying selection Figure 198
We see this in many animal populations that have multiple male forms Large dominant alpha males use
brute force to obtain mates while small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an
alpha males territory In this case both the alpha males and the sneaking males will be selected for but
mediumsized males who cant overtake the alpha males and are too big to sneak copulations are selected
against Diversifying selection can also occur when environmental changes favor individuals on either end of
the phenotypic spectrum Imagine a mouse population living at the beach where there is lightcolored sand
interspersed with patches of tall grass In this scenario lightcolored mice that blend in with the sand would be
favored as well as darkcolored mice that can hide in the grass Mediumcolored mice alternatively would not
blend in with either the grass or the sand and thus predators would most likely eat them The result of this type
of selection is increased genetic variance as the population becomes more diverse
