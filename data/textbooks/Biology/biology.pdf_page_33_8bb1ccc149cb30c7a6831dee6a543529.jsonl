Some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes We call these organelles
Organelles are small structures that exist within cells Examples of organelles include mitochondria and
chloroplasts which carry out indispensable functions mitochondria produce energy to power the cell while
chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars All living things are made
of cells The cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms This
requirement is why scientists do not consider viruses living they are not made of cells To make new viruses
they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell Only then can they obtain the
materials they need to reproduce Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular
Scientists classify cells as prokaryotic or eukaryotic Prokaryotes are singlecelled or colonial organisms that
do not have membranebound nuclei In contrast the cells of eukaryotes do have membranebound organelles
and a membranebound nucleus
In larger organisms cells combine to make tissues which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or
related functions Organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function Organs
