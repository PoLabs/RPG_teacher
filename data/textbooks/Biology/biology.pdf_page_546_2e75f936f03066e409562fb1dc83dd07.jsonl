a
why more fit individuals are more likely to
have more offspring
b
why alleles that confer beneficial traits or
behaviors are selected for by natural
selection
c
why some deleterious mutations are
maintained in the population
d
why individuals of one sex develop
impressive ornamental traits
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
16 Solve for the genetic structure of a population
with 12 homozygous recessive individuals yy 8
homozygous dominant individuals YY and 4
heterozygous individuals Yy
17 Explain the HardyWeinberg principle of
equilibrium theory
18 Imagine you are trying to test whether a
population of flowers is undergoing evolution You
suspect there is selection pressure on the color of the
flower bees seem to cluster around the red flowers
more often than the blue flowers In a separate
experiment you discover blue flower color is
dominant to red flower color In a field you count 600
blue flowers and 200 red flowers What would you
expect the genetic structure of the flowers to be
19 Describe a situation in which a population would
undergo the bottleneck effect and explain what
impact that would have on the populations gene
pool
20 Describe natural selection and give an example
of natural selection at work in a population
21 Explain what a cline is and provide examples
22 Give an example of a trait that may have evolved
as a result of the handicap principle and explain your
reasoning
23 List the ways in which evolution can affect
population variation and describe how they influence
allele frequencies
