cell walls limit so the cell will not lyse The cytoplasm in plants is always slightly hypertonic to the cellular
environment and water will always enter a cell if water is available This water inflow produces turgor pressure
which stiffens the plants cell walls Figure 513 In nonwoody plants turgor pressure supports the plant
Conversly if you do not water the plant the extracellular fluid will become hypertonic causing water to leave the
cell In this condition the cell does not shrink because the cell wall is not flexible However the cell membrane
detaches from the wall and constricts the cytoplasm We call this plasmolysis Plants lose turgor pressure in
this condition and wilt Figure 514
Figure 513 The turgor pressure within a plant cell depends on the solutions tonicity in which it is bathed credit

Figure 514 Without adequate water the plant on the left has lost turgor pressure visible in its wilting Watering the
plant right will restore the turgor pressure credit Victor M Vicente Selvas
Tonicity is a concern for all living things For example paramecia and amoebas which are protists that lack cell
walls have contractile vacuoles This vesicle collects excess water from the cell and pumps it out keeping the
cell from lysing as it takes on water from its environment Figure 515
Figure 515 A parameciums contractile vacuole here visualized using bright field light microscopy at 480x
magnification continuously pumps water out of the organisms body to keep it from bursting in a hypotonic medium

Many marine invertebrates have internal salt levels matched to their environments making them isotonic with
the water in which they live Fish however must spend approximately five percent of their metabolic energy
maintaining osmotic homeostasis Freshwater fish live in an environment that is hypotonic to their cells These
