alternation of generations Both Chlamydomonas and Ulva produce flagellated gametes
Charophytes
The charophytes include several different algal orders that have each been suggested to be the closest relatives
of the land plants the Charales the Zygnematales and the Coleochaetales The Charales can be traced back
420 million years They live in a range of freshwater habitats and vary in size from a few millimeters to a meter
in length The representative genus is Chara Figure 258 often called muskgrass or skunkweed because of
its unpleasant smell Large cells form the thallus the main stem of the alga Branches arising from the nodes
are made of smaller cells Male and female reproductive structures are found on the nodes and the sperm have
flagella Although Chara looks superficially like some land plants a major difference is that the stem has no
supportive tissue However the Charales exhibit a number of traits that are significant for adaptation to land life
They produce the compounds lignin and sporopollenin and form plasmodesmata that connect the cytoplasm of
adjacent cells Although the life cycle of the Charales is haplontic the main form is haploid and diploid zygotes
are formed but have a brief existence the egg and later the zygote form in a protected chamber on the haploid
parent plant

The Coleochaetes are branched or disclike multicellular forms They can produce both sexually and asexually
but the life cycle is basically haplontic Recent extensive DNA sequence analysis of charophytes indicates that
the Zygnematales are more closely related to the embryophytes than the Charales or the Coleochaetales The
Zygnematales include the familiar genus Spirogyra as well as the desmids As techniques in DNA analysis
improve and new information on comparative genomics arises the phylogenetic connections between the
charophytes and the land plants will continued to be examined to produce a satisfactory solution to the mystery
of the origin of land plants
253  Bryophytes
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify the main characteristics of bryophytes

Describe the distinguishing traits of liverworts hornworts and mosses

Chart the development of land adaptations in the bryophytes

Describe the events in the bryophyte lifecycle
Bryophytes are the closest extant relatives of early terrestrial plants The first bryophytes liverworts most likely
appeared in the Ordovician period about 450 million years ago Because they lack lignin and other resistant
structures the likelihood of bryophytes forming fossils is rather small Some spores protected by sporopollenin
have survived and are attributed to early bryophytes By the Silurian period 435 MYA however vascular plants
