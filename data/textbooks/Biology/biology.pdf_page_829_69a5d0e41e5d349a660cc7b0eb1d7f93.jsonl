the ecdysozoans and does not require periodic shedding for growth Circular as well as longitudinal muscles are
located interior to the epidermis Chitinous bristles called setae or chaetae are anchored in the epidermis each
with its own muscle In the polychaetes the setae are borne on paired appendages called parapodia
Most annelids have a welldeveloped and complete digestive system Feeding mechanisms vary widely across
the phylum Some polychaetes are filterfeeders that use featherlike appendages to collect small organisms
Others have tentacles jaws or an eversible pharynx to capture prey Earthworms collect small organisms from
soil as they burrow through it and most leeches are bloodfeeders armed with teeth or a muscular proboscis
In earthworms the digestive tract includes a mouth muscular pharynx esophagus crop and muscular gizzard
The gizzard leads to the intestine which ends in an anal opening in the terminal segment A crosssectional
view of a body segment of an earthworm is shown in Figure 2830 each segment is limited by a membranous
septum that divides the coelomic cavity into a series of compartments
Most annelids possess a closed circulatory system of dorsal and ventral blood vessels that run parallel to the
alimentary canal as well as capillaries that service individual tissues In addition the dorsal and ventral vessels
are connected by transverse loops in every segment Some polychaetes and leeches have an open system
in which the major blood vessels open into a hemocoel In many species the blood contains hemoglobin but
not contained in cells Annelids lack a welldeveloped respiratory system and gas exchange occurs across the
moist body surface In the polychaetes the parapodia are highly vascular and serve as respiratory structures
Excretion is facilitated by a pair of metanephridia a type of primitive kidney that consists of a convoluted tubule
and an open ciliated funnel that is present in every segment toward the ventral side Annelids show well
developed nervous systems with a ring of fused ganglia present around the pharynx The nerve cord is ventral
in position and bears enlarged nodes or ganglia in each segment
Figure 2830 Segmental anatomy of an earthworm This schematic drawing shows the basic anatomy of annelids in a
crosssectional view
Annelids may be either monoecious with permanent gonads as in earthworms and leeches or dioecious
with temporary or seasonal gonads as in polychaetes However crossfertilization is preferred even in
hermaphroditic animals Earthworms may show simultaneous mutual fertilization when they are aligned for
copulation Some leeches change their sex over their reproductive lifetimes In most polychaetes fertilization
is external and development includes a trochophore larva which then metamorphoizes to the adult form In
oligochaetes fertilization is typically internal and the fertilized eggs develop in a cocoon produced by the
clitellum development is direct Polychaetes are excellent regenerators and some even reproduce asexually by
budding or fragmentation
