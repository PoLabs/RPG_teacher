Figure 323 There are 20 common amino acids commonly found in proteins each with a different R group variant
group that determines its chemical nature
Which categories of amino acid would you expect to find on a soluble proteins surface and which would
you expect to find in the interior What distribution of amino acids would you expect to find in a protein
embedded in a lipid bilayer
The chemical nature of the side chain determines the amino acids nature that is whether it is acidic basic
polar or nonpolar For example the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the R group Amino acids such
as valine methionine and alanine are nonpolar or hydrophobic in nature while amino acids such as serine
threonine and cysteine are polar and have hydrophilic side chains The side chains of lysine and arginine are
positively charged and therefore these amino acids are also basic amino acids Proline has an R group that
is linked to the amino group forming a ringlike structure Proline is an exception to the amino acids standard
structure since its amino group is not separate from the side chain Figure 323
A single upper case letter or a threeletter abbreviation represents amino acids For example the letter V or
the threeletter symbol val represent valine Just as some fatty acids are essential to a diet some amino acids
also are necessary These essential amino acids in humans include isoleucine leucine and cysteine Essential
amino acids refer to those necessary to build proteins in the body but not those that the body produces Which
amino acids are essential varies from organism to organism
The sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the proteins shape size and function A
covalent bond or peptide bond attaches to each amino acid which a dehydration reaction forms One amino
acids carboxyl group and the incoming amino acids amino group combine releasing a water molecule The
resulting bond is the peptide bond Figure 324
