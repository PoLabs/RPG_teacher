Figure 107 During prometaphase mitotic spindle microtubules from opposite poles attach to each sister chromatid at
the kinetochore In anaphase the connection between the sister chromatids breaks down and the microtubules pull
the chromosomes toward opposite poles
Metaphase the change phase All the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the metaphase plate or
the equatorial plane roughly midway between the two poles of the cell The sister chromatids are still tightly
attached to each other by cohesin proteins At this time the chromosomes are maximally condensed
Anaphase upward phase The cohesin proteins degrade and the sister chromatids separate at the
centromere Each chromatid now called a single chromosome is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which
its microtubule is attached The cell becomes visibly elongated oval shaped as the polar microtubules slide
against each other at the metaphase plate where they overlap
Telophase the distance phase the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense
unravel relaxing once again into a stretchedout chromatin configuration The mitotic spindles are
depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter
cell Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes and nucleosomes appear within the nuclear area
Cytokinesis
Cytokinesis or cell motion is sometimes viewed as the second main stage of the mitotic phase during which
cell division is completed via the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells
However as we have seen earlier cytokinesis can also be viewed as a separate phase which may or may not
take place following mitosis If cytokinesis does take place cell division is not complete until the cell components
have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells Although the stages of mitosis are
similar for most eukaryotes the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes that have cell walls such
as plant cells
In animal cells cytokinesis typically starts during late anaphase A contractile ring composed of actin filaments
forms just inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate The actin filaments pull the equator of
the cell inward forming a fissure This fissure is called the cleavage furrow The furrow deepens as the actin
ring contracts and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two Figure 108
In plant cells a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells During interphase the Golgi apparatus
accumulates enzymes structural proteins and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing
throughout the dividing cell During telophase these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a
phragmoplast a vesicular structure at the metaphase plate There the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the
center toward the cell walls this structure is called a cell plate As more vesicles fuse the cell plate enlarges
until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell Enzymes use the glucose that has accumulated
between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall The Golgi membranes become parts of the plasma
membrane on either side of the new cell wall Figure 108
