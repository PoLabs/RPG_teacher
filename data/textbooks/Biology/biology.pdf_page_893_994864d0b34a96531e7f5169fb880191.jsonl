their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life
Mammals like birds possess a fourchambered heart however the hearts of birds and mammals are an
example of convergent evolution since mammals clearly arose independently from different groups of tetrapod
ancestors Mammals also have a specialized group of cardiac cells fibers located in the walls of their right
atrium called the sinoatrial node or pacemaker which determines the rate at which the heart beats Mammalian
erythrocytes red blood cells do not have nuclei whereas the erythrocytes of other vertebrates are nucleated
The kidneys of mammals have a portion of the nephron called the loop of Henle or nephritic loop which allows
mammals to produce urine with a high concentration of soluteshigher than that of the blood Mammals lack
a renal portal system which is a system of veins that moves blood from the hind or lower limbs and region of
the tail to the kidneys Renal portal systems are present in all other vertebrates except jawless fishes A urinary
bladder is present in all mammals
Unlike birds the skulls of mammals have two occipital condyles bones at the base of the skull that articulate
with the first vertebra as well as a secondary palate at the rear of the pharynx that helps to separate the pathway
of swallowing from that of breathing Turbinate bones chonchae in humans are located along the sides of
the nasal cavity and help warm and moisten air as it is inhaled The pelvic bones are fused in mammals and
there are typically seven cervical vertebrae except for some edentates and manatees Mammals have movable
eyelids and fleshy external ears pinnae quite unlike the naked external auditory openings of birds Mammals
also have a muscular diaphragm that is lacking in birds
Mammalian brains also have certain characteristics that differ from the brains of other vertebrates In some
but not all mammals the cerebral cortex the outermost part of the cerebrum is highly convoluted and folded
allowing for a greater surface area than is possible with a smooth cortex The optic lobes located in the midbrain
are divided into two parts in mammals while other vertebrates possess a single undivided lobe Eutherian
mammals also possess a specialized structure the corpus callosum which links the two cerebral hemispheres
together The corpus callosum functions to integrate motor sensory and cognitive functions between the left and
right cerebral cortexes
Evolution of Mammals
Mammals are synapsids meaning they have a single ancestrally fused postorbital opening in the skull They
are the only living synapsids as earlier forms became extinct by the Jurassic period The early nonmammalian
synapsids can be divided into two groups the pelycosaurs and the therapsids Within the therapsids a group
called the cynodonts are thought to have been the ancestors of mammals Figure 2938
Figure 2938 Cynodont Cynodonts dog teeth which first appeared in the Late Permian period 260 million years
ago are thought to be the ancestors of modern mammals Holes in the upper jaws of cynodonts suggest that they had
whiskers which might also indicate the presence of hair credit Nobu Tamura
As with birds a key characteristic of synapsids is endothermy rather than the ectothermy seen in many other
vertebrates such as fish amphibians and most reptiles The increased metabolic rate required to internally
modify body temperature likely went handinhand with changes to certain skeletal structures that improved food
processing and ambulation The later synapsids which had more evolved characteristics unique to mammals
possess cheeks for holding food and heterodont teeth which are specialized for chewing mechanically breaking
down food to speed digestion and releasing the energy needed to produce heat Chewing also requires the
ability to breathe at the same time which is facilitated by the presence of a secondary palate comprising the
bony palate and the posterior continuation of the soft palate The secondary palate separates the area of the
mouth where chewing occurs from the area above where respiration occurs allowing breathing to proceed
uninterrupted while the animal is chewing A secondary palate is not found in pelycosaurs but is present in
