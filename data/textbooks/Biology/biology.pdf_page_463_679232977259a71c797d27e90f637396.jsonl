Protooncogenes are positive cellcycle regulators When mutated protooncogenes can become oncogenes
and cause cancer Overexpression of the oncogene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth This is because
oncogenes can alter transcriptional activity stability or protein translation of another gene that directly or
indirectly controls cell growth An example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc Myc
is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in Burketts Lymphoma a cancer of the lymph system
Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably
High Bcell numbers can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily function Patients with Burketts
lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth that interfere with the ability to eat
Cancer and Epigenetic Alterations
Silencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in cancer cells There are characteristic
modifications to histone proteins and DNA that are associated with silenced genes In cancer cells the DNA
in the promoter region of silenced genes is methylated on cytosine DNA residues in CpG islands Histone
proteins that surround that region lack the acetylation modification that is present when the genes are expressed
in normal cells This combination of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation epigenetic modifications that
lead to gene silencing is commonly found in cancer When these modifications occur the gene present in
that chromosomal region is silenced Increasingly scientists understand how epigenetic changes are altered in
cancer Because these changes are temporary and can be reversedfor example by preventing the action of
the histone deacetylase protein that removes acetyl groups or by DNA methyl transferase enzymes that add
methyl groups to cytosines in DNAit is possible to design new drugs and new therapies to take advantage
of the reversible nature of these processes Indeed many researchers are testing how a silenced gene can be
switched back on in a cancer cell to help reestablish normal growth patterns
Genes involved in the development of many other illnesses ranging from allergies to inflammation to autism
are thought to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms As our knowledge of how genes are controlled deepens
new ways to treat diseases like cancer will emerge
Cancer and Transcriptional Control
Alterations in cells that give rise to cancer can affect the transcriptional control of gene expression Mutations
that activate transcription factors such as increased phosphorylation can increase the binding of a transcription
factor to its binding site in a promoter This could lead to increased transcriptional activation of that gene that
results in modified cell growth Alternatively a mutation in the DNA of a promoter or enhancer region can
increase the binding ability of a transcription factor This could also lead to the increased transcription and
aberrant gene expression that is seen in cancer cells
Researchers have been investigating how to control the transcriptional activation of gene expression in cancer
Identifying how a transcription factor binds or a pathway that activates where a gene can be turned off has led to
new drugs and new ways to treat cancer In breast cancer for example many proteins are overexpressed This
can lead to increased phosphorylation of key transcription factors that increase transcription One such example
is the overexpression of the epidermal growthfactor receptor EGFR in a subset of breast cancers The EGFR
pathway activates many protein kinases that in turn activate many transcription factors which control genes
involved in cell growth New drugs that prevent the activation of EGFR have been developed and are used to
treat these cancers
Cancer and Posttranscriptional Control
Changes in the posttranscriptional control of a gene can also result in cancer Recently several groups of
researchers have shown that specific cancers have altered expression of miRNAs Because miRNAs bind to the
3 UTR of RNA molecules to degrade them overexpression of these miRNAs could be detrimental to normal
