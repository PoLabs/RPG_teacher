Pathways of Photosynthesis and Cellular Metabolism
The processes of photosynthesis and cellular metabolism consist of several very complex pathways It
is generally thought that the first cells arose in an aqueous environmenta soup of nutrientspossibly
on the surface of some porous clays perhaps in warm marine environments If these cells reproduced
successfully and their numbers climbed steadily it follows that the cells would begin to deplete the nutrients
from the medium in which they lived as they shifted the nutrients into the components of their own bodies
This hypothetical situation would have resulted in natural selection favoring those organisms that could exist
by using the nutrients that remained in their environment and by manipulating these nutrients into materials
upon which they could survive Selection would favor those organisms that could extract maximal value from
the nutrients to which they had access
An early form of photosynthesis developed that harnessed the suns energy using water as a source of
hydrogen atoms but this pathway did not produce free oxygen anoxygenic photosynthesis Another type
of anoxygenic photosynthesis did not produce free oxygen because it did not use water as the source
of hydrogen ions instead it used materials such as hydrogen sulfide and consequently produced sulfur
It is thought that glycolysis developed at this time and could take advantage of the simple sugars being
produced but that these reactions were unable to fully extract the energy stored in the carbohydrates The
development of glycolysis probably predated the evolution of photosynthesis as it was well suited to extract
energy from materials spontaneously accumulating in the primeval soup A later form of photosynthesis
used water as a source of electrons and hydrogen and generated free oxygen Over time the atmosphere
became oxygenated but not before the oxygen released oxidized metals in the ocean and created a rust
layer in the sediment permitting the dating of the rise of the first oxygenic photosynthesizers Living things
adapted to exploit this new atmosphere that allowed aerobic respiration as we know it to evolve When
the full process of oxygenic photosynthesis developed and the atmosphere became oxygenated cells were
finally able to use the oxygen expelled by photosynthesis to extract considerably more energy from the
sugar molecules using the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
77  Regulation of Cellular Respiration
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how feedback inhibition would affect the production of an intermediate or product in a pathway

Identify the mechanism that controls the rate of the transport of electrons through the electron transport
chain
Cellular respiration must be regulated in order to provide balanced amounts of energy in the form of ATP The
cell also must generate a number of intermediate compounds that are used in the anabolism and catabolism
of macromolecules Without controls metabolic reactions would quickly come to a standstill as the forward and
backward reactions reached a state of equilibrium Resources would be used inappropriately A cell does not
