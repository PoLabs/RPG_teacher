CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
26 Compare and contrast food chains and food
webs What are the strengths of each concept in
describing ecosystems
27 Describe freshwater ocean and terrestrial
ecosystems
28 Compare grazing and detrital food webs Why
would they both be present in the same ecosystem
29 How does the microcosm modeling approach
differ from utilizing a holistic model for ecological
research
30 How do conceptual and analytical models of
ecosystems compliment each other
31 Compare the three types of ecological pyramids
and how well they describe ecosystem structure
Identify which ones can be inverted and give an
example of an inverted pyramid for each
32 How does the amount of food a warmblooded
animal endotherm eats relate to its net production
efficiency NPE
33 A study uses an inverted pyramid to demonstrate
