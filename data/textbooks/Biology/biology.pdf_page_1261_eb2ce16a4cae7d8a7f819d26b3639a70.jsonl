Introduction
Most animals are complex multicellular organisms that require a mechanism for transporting nutrients throughout
their bodies and removing waste products The circulatory system has evolved over time from simple diffusion
through cells in the early evolution of animals to a complex network of blood vessels that reach all parts of
the human body This extensive network supplies the cells tissues and organs with oxygen and nutrients and
removes carbon dioxide and waste which are byproducts of respiration
At the core of the human circulatory system is the heart The size of a clenched fist the human heart is protected
beneath the rib cage Made of specialized and unique cardiac muscle it pumps blood throughout the body and
to the heart itself Heart contractions are driven by intrinsic electrical impulses that the brain and endocrine
hormones help to regulate Understanding the hearts basic anatomy and function is important to understanding
the bodys circulatory and respiratory systems
Gas exchange is one essential function of the circulatory system A circulatory system is not needed in
organisms with no specialized respiratory organs because oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse directly between
their body tissues and the external environment However in organisms that possess lungs and gills oxygen
must be transported from these specialized respiratory organs to the body tissues via a circulatory system
Therefore circulatory systems have had to evolve to accommodate the great diversity of body sizes and body
types present among animals
