Why do you think this is the case
2 Figure 4510b If the major food source of the
seals declines due to pollution or overfishing which
of the following would likely occur
a
The carrying capacity of seals would
decrease as would the seal population
b
The carrying capacity of seals would
decrease but the seal population would
remain the same
c
The number of seal deaths would increase
but the number of births would also
increase so the population size would
remain the same
d
The carrying capacity of seals would remain
the same but the population of seals would
decrease

growing slow growing and stable populations are
shown in stages 1 through 3 What type of population
change do you think stage 4 represents
