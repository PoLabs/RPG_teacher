Immunological Memory
The adaptive immune system possesses a memory component that allows for an efficient and dramatic
response upon reinvasion of the same pathogen Memory is handled by the adaptive immune system with little
reliance on cues from the innate response During the adaptive immune response to a pathogen that has not
been encountered before called a primary response plasma cells secreting antibodies and differentiated T cells
increase then plateau over time As B and T cells mature into effector cells a subset of the nave populations
differentiates into B and T memory cells with the same antigen specificities as illustrated in Figure 4216
A memory cell is an antigenspecific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during
the primary immune response but that can immediately become effector cells upon reexposure to the same
pathogen During the primary immune response memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute
to host defenses As the infection is cleared and pathogenic stimuli subside the effectors are no longer needed
and they undergo apoptosis In contrast the memory cells persist in the circulation
Figure 4216 After initially binding an antigen to the B cell receptor BCR a B cell internalizes the antigen and
presents it on MHC II A helper T cell recognizes the MHC IIantigen complex and activates the B cell As a result
memory B cells and plasma cells are made
The Rh antigen is found on Rhpositive red blood cells An Rhnegative female can usually carry an Rh
positive fetus to term without difficulty However if she has a second Rhpositive fetus her body may launch
an immune attack that causes hemolytic disease of the newborn Why do you think hemolytic disease is
only a problem during the second or subsequent pregnancies
