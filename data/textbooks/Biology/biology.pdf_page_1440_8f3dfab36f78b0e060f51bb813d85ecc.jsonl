Figure 4518 The cycling of lynx and snowshoe hare populations in Northern Ontario is an example of predatorprey
dynamics
Some researchers question the idea that predation models entirely control the population cycling of the two
species More recent studies have pointed to undefined densitydependent factors as being important in the
cycling in addition to predation One possibility is that the cycling is inherent in the hare population due
to densitydependent effects such as lower fecundity maternal stress caused by crowding when the hare
population gets too dense The hare cycling would then induce the cycling of the lynx because it is the lynxes
major food source The more we study communities the more complexities we find allowing ecologists to derive
more accurate and sophisticated models of population dynamics
Herbivory describes the consumption of plants by insects and other animals and it is another interspecific
relationship that affects populations Unlike animals most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide
from hungry animals Some plants have developed mechanisms to defend against herbivory Other species have
developed mutualistic relationships for example herbivory provides a mechanism of seed distribution that aids
in plant reproduction
Defense Mechanisms against Predation and Herbivory
The study of communities must consider evolutionary forces that act on the members of the various populations
contained within it Species are not static but slowly changing and adapting to their environment by natural
selection and other evolutionary forces Species have evolved numerous mechanisms to escape predation and
herbivory These defenses may be mechanical chemical physical or behavioral
Mechanical defenses such as the presence of thorns on plants or the hard shell on turtles discourage animal
predation and herbivory by causing physical pain to the predator or by physically preventing the predator from
being able to eat the prey Chemical defenses are produced by many animals as well as plants such as the
foxglove which is extremely toxic when eaten Figure 4519 shows some organisms defenses against predation
and herbivory
