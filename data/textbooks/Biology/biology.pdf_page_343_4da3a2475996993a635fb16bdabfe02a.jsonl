Of the 12 possible outcomes the die has a 212 or 16 probability of rolling a two and the penny has a 612
or 12 probability of coming up heads By the product rule the probability that you will obtain the combined
outcome 2 and heads is D2 x PH  16 x 12 or 112 Table 123 Notice the word and in the description
of the probability The and is a signal to apply the product rule For example consider how the product rule is
applied to the dihybrid cross the probability of having both dominant traits in the F2 progeny is the product of the
probabilities of having the dominant trait for each characteristic as shown here

On the other hand the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes
that can come about by more than one pathway The sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of
one event or the other event of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of their individual probabilities Notice
the word or in the description of the probability The or indicates that you should apply the sum rule In this
case lets imagine you are flipping a penny P and a quarter Q What is the probability of one coin coming
up heads and one coin coming up tails This outcome can be achieved by two cases the penny may be heads
PH and the quarter may be tails QT or the quarter may be heads QH and the penny may be tails PT Either
case fulfills the outcome By the sum rule we calculate the probability of obtaining one head and one tail as
PH  QT  QH  PT  12  12  12  12  12 Table 123 You should also notice that we
used the product rule to calculate the probability of PH and QT and also the probability of PT and QH before we
summed them Again the sum rule can be applied to show the probability of having just one dominant trait in the
F2 generation of a dihybrid cross

The Product Rule and Sum Rule
Product Rule
Sum Rule
For independent events A and B the probability P
of them both occurring A and B is PA  PB
For mutually exclusive events A and B the probability
P that at least one occurs A or B is PA  PB

To use probability laws in practice we must work with large sample sizes because small sample sizes are prone
to deviations caused by chance The large quantities of pea plants that Mendel examined allowed him calculate
the probabilities of the traits appearing in his F2 generation As you will learn this discovery meant that when
parental traits were known the offsprings traits could be predicted accurately even before fertilization
