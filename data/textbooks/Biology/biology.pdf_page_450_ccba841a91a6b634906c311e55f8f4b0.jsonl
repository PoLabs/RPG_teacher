binds to the promoters of operons which control the processing of alternative sugars When cAMP binds to CAP
the complex then binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources
Figure 164 In these operons a CAPbinding site is located upstream of the RNApolymerasebinding site
in the promoter CAP binding stabilizes the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and increases
transcription of the associated proteincoding genes
Figure 164 Transcriptional activation by the CAP protein When glucose levels fall E coli may use other sugars for
fuel but must transcribe new genes to do so As glucose supplies become limited cAMP levels increase This cAMP
binds to the CAP protein a positive regulator that binds to a promoter region upstream of the genes required to use
other sugar sources
The lac Operon An Inducible Operon
The third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons which have proteins that
bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell The lac
operon is a typical inducible operon As mentioned previously E coli is able to use other sugars as energy
sources when glucose concentrations are low One such sugar source is lactose The lac operon encodes the
genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment The Z gene of the lac operon
encodes betagalactosidase which breaks lactose down to glucose and galactose
However for the lac operon to be activated two conditions must be met First the level of glucose must be very
low or nonexistent Second lactose must be present Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will
the lac operon be transcribed Figure 165 In the absence of glucose the binding of the CAP protein makes
transcription of the lac operon more effective When lactose is present it binds to the lac repressor and changes
its shape so that it cannot bind to the lac operator to prevent transcription This combination of conditions makes
sense for the cell because it would be energetically wasteful to synthesize the enzymes to process lactose if
glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available
