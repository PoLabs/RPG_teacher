Electron Microscopes
In contrast to light microscopes electron microscopes Figure 42b use a beam of electrons instead of a
beam of light Not only does this allow for higher magnification and thus more detail Figure 43 it also
provides higher resolving power The method to prepare the specimen for viewing with an electron microscope
kills the specimen Electrons have short wavelengths shorter than photons that move best in a vacuum so we
cannot view living cells with an electron microscope
In a scanning electron microscope a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cells surface creating
details of cell surface characteristics In a transmission electron microscope the electron beam penetrates
the cell and provides details of a cells internal structures As you might imagine electron microscopes are
significantly more bulky and expensive than light microscopes

Figure 43 a These Salmonella bacteria appear as tiny purple dots when viewed with a light microscope b This
scanning electron microscope micrograph shows Salmonella bacteria in red invading human cells yellow Even
though subfigure b shows a different Salmonella specimen than subfigure a you can still observe the comparative
increase in magnification and detail credit a modification of work by CDCArmed Forces Institute of Pathology

Cell Theory
The microscopes we use today are far more complex than those that Dutch shopkeeper Antony van
Leeuwenhoek used in the 1600s Skilled in crafting lenses van Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of
singlecelled organisms which he collectively termed animalcules
In the 1665 publication Micrographia experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term cell for the boxlike
structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens In the 1670s van Leeuwenhoek discovered
bacteria and protozoa Later advances in lenses microscope construction and staining techniques enabled
other scientists to see some components inside cells
By the late 1830s botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and
proposed the unified cell theory which states that one or more cells comprise all living things the cell is the
basic unit of life and new cells arise from existing cells Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to
this theory
