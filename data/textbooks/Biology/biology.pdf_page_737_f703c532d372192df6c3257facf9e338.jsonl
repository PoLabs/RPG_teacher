CHAPTER SUMMARY
251 Early Plant Life
Land plants acquired traits that made it possible to colonize land and survive out of the water All land plants
share the following characteristics alternation of generations with the haploid plant called a gametophyte and
the diploid plant called a sporophyte formation of haploid spores in a sporangium formation of gametes in a
gametangium protection of the embryo and an apical meristem Vascular tissues roots leaves cuticle cover
and a tough outer layer that protects the spores contributed to the adaptation of plants to dry land Land plants
appeared about 500 million years ago in the Ordovician period
252 Green Algae Precursors of Land Plants
Charophytes share more traits with land plants than do other algae according to structural features and DNA
analysis Within the charophytes the Charales the Coleochaetales and the Zygnematales have been each
considered as sharing the closest common ancestry with the land plants Charophytes form sporopollenin and
precursors of lignin phragmoplasts and have flagellated sperm They do not exhibit alternation of generations
253 Bryophytes
Seedless nonvascular plants are small having the gametophyte as the dominant stage of the lifecycle
Without a vascular system and roots they absorb water and nutrients on all their exposed surfaces
Collectively known as bryophytes the three main groups include the liverworts the hornworts and the mosses
Liverworts are the most primitive plants and are closely related to the first land plants Hornworts developed
stomata and possess a single chloroplast per cell Mosses have simple conductive cells and are attached to
the substrate by rhizoids They colonize harsh habitats and can regain moisture after drying out The moss
sporangium is a complex structure that allows release of spores away from the parent plant
254 Seedless Vascular Plants
The seedless vascular plants show several features important to living on land vascular tissue roots and
leaves Vascular systems consist of xylem tissue which transports water and minerals and phloem tissue
