Current and Past Drivers of Global Climate Change
Because it is not possible to go back in time to directly observe and measure climate scientists must use indirect
evidence to determine the drivers or factors that may be responsible for climate change The indirect evidence
includes data collected using ice cores boreholes a narrow shaft bored into the ground tree rings glacier
lengths pollen remains and ocean sediments The data shows a correlation between the timing of temperature
changes and drivers of climate change Before the Industrial Era pre1780 there were three drivers of climate
change that were not related to human activity or atmospheric gases The first of these is the Milankovitch cycles
The Milankovitch cycles describe the effects of slight changes in the Earths orbit on Earths climate The length
of the Milankovitch cycles ranges between 19000 and 100000 years In other words one could expect to see
some predictable changes in the Earths climate associated with changes in the Earths orbit at a minimum of
every 19000 years
The variation in the suns intensity is the second natural factor responsible for climate change Solar intensity
is the amount of solar power or energy the sun emits in a given amount of time There is a direct relationship
between solar intensity and temperature As solar intensity increases or decreases the Earths temperature
correspondingly increases or decreases Changes in solar intensity have been proposed as one of several
possible explanations for the Little Ice Age
Finally volcanic eruptions are a third natural driver of climate change Volcanic eruptions can last a few days but
the solids and gases released during an eruption can influence the climate over a period of a few years causing
shortterm climate changes The gases and solids released by volcanic eruptions can include carbon dioxide
water vapor sulfur dioxide hydrogen sulfide hydrogen and carbon monoxide Generally volcanic eruptions cool
the climate This occurred in 1783 when volcanos in Iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes
of sulfuric oxide This led to hazeeffect cooling a global phenomenon that occurs when dust ash or other
suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global temperatures as a result hazeeffect cooling
usually extends for one or more years before dissipating in intensity In Europe and North America hazeeffect
cooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in 1783 and 1784
Greenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate When heat energy from the sun
strikes the Earth gases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere in a similar manner
as do the glass panes of a greenhouse keep heat from escaping The greenhouse gases that affect Earth
include carbon dioxide methane water vapor nitrous oxide and ozone Approximately half of the radiation from
the sun passes through these gases in the atmosphere and strikes the Earth This radiation is converted into
thermal infrared radiation on the Earths surface and then a portion of that energy is reradiated back into the
atmosphere Greenhouse gases however reflect much of the thermal energy back to the Earths surface The
more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere the more thermal energy is reflected back to the Earths
surface heating it up and the atmosphere immediately above it Greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation
and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect the warming of Earth due to carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
Direct evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and
temperature as carbon dioxide rises global temperature rises Since 1950 the concentration of atmospheric
