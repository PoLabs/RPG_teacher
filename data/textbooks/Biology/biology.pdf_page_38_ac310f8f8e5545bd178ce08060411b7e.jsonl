Paleontology another branch of biology uses fossils to study lifes history Figure 120 Zoology and botany
are the study of animals and plants respectively Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists ecologists
or physiologists to name just a few areas This is just a small sample of the many fields that biologists can
pursue
Biology is the culmination of the achievements of the natural sciences from their inception to today Excitingly
it is the cradle of emerging sciences such as the biology of brain activity genetic engineering of custom
organisms and the biology of evolution that uses the laboratory tools of molecular biology to retrace the earliest
stages of life on Earth A scan of news headlineswhether reporting on immunizations a newly discovered
species sports doping or a geneticallymodified fooddemonstrates the way biology is active in and important
to our everyday world
