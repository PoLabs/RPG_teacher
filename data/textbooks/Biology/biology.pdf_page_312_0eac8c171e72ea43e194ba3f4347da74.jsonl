CHAPTER SUMMARY
101 Cell Division
Prokaryotes have a single circular chromosome composed of doublestranded DNA whereas eukaryotes have
multiple linear chromosomes composed of chromatin wrapped around histones all of which are surrounded by
a nuclear membrane The 46 chromosomes of human somatic cells are composed of 22 pairs of autosomes
matched pairs and a pair of sex chromosomes which may or may not be matched This is the 2n or diploid
state Human gametes have 23 chromosomes or one complete set of chromosomes a set of chromosomes is
complete with either one of the sex chromosomes X or Y This is the n or haploid state Genes are segments of
DNA that code for a specific functional molecule a protein or RNA An organisms traits are determined by the
genes inherited from each parent Duplicated chromosomes are composed of two sister chromatids
Chromosomes are compacted using a variety of mechanisms during certain stages of the cell cycle Several
classes of protein are involved in the organization and packing of the chromosomal DNA into a highly
condensed structure The condensing complex compacts chromosomes and the resulting condensed structure
is necessary for chromosomal segregation during mitosis
102 The Cell Cycle
The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of
precisely timed and carefully regulated stages In eukaryotes the cell cycle consists of a long preparatory
period called interphase during which chromosomes are replicated Interphase is divided into G1 S and G2
phases The mitotic phase begins with karyokinesis mitosis which consists of five stages prophase
prometaphase metaphase anaphase and telophase The final stage of the cell division process and
sometimes viewed as the final stage of the mitotic phase is cytokinesis during which the cytoplasmic
components of the daughter cells are separated either by an actin ring animal cells or by cell plate formation
plant cells
103 Control of the Cell Cycle
Each step of the cell cycle is monitored by internal controls called checkpoints There are three major
checkpoints in the cell cycle one near the end of G1 a second at the G2M transition and the third during
metaphase Positive regulator molecules allow the cell cycle to advance to the next stage of cell division
Negative regulator molecules monitor cellular conditions and can halt the cycle until specific requirements are
met
104 Cancer and the Cell Cycle
Cancer is the result of unchecked cell division caused by a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate the cell
cycle The loss of control begins with a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that codes for one of the
regulatory molecules Faulty instructions lead to a protein that does not function as it should Any disruption of
the monitoring system can allow other mistakes to be passed on to the daughter cells Each successive cell
division will give rise to daughter cells with even more accumulated damage Eventually all checkpoints
become nonfunctional and rapidly reproducing cells crowd out normal cells resulting in a tumor or leukemia
blood cancer
105 Prokaryotic Cell Division
In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell division the genomic DNA is replicated and then each copy is allocated
into a daughter cell In addition the cytoplasmic contents are divided evenly and distributed to the new cells
However there are many differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell division Bacteria have a single
circular DNA chromosome but no nucleus Therefore mitosis karyokinesis is not necessary in bacterial cell
division Bacterial cytokinesis is directed by a ring composed of a protein called FtsZ Ingrowth of membrane
and cell wall material from the periphery of the cells results in the formation of a septum that eventually
constructs the separate cell walls of the daughter cells
