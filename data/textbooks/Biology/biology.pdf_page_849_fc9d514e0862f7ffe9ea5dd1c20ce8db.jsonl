Reproduction
Echinoderms are dioecious but males and females are indistinguishable apart from their gametes Males and
females release their gametes into water at the same time and fertilization is external The early larval stages
of all echinoderms eg the bipinnaria of asteroid echinoderms such as sea stars have bilateral symmetry
although each class of echinoderms has its own larval form The radially symmetrical adult forms from a cluster
of cells in the larva Sea stars brittle stars and sea cucumbers may also reproduce asexually by fragmentation
as well as regenerate body parts lost in trauma even when over 75 percent of their body mass is lost
Classes of Echinoderms
This phylum is divided into five extant classes Asteroidea sea stars Ophiuroidea brittle stars Echinoidea
sea urchins and sand dollars Crinoidea sea lilies or feather stars and Holothuroidea sea cucumbers

The most wellknown echinoderms are members of class Asteroidea or sea stars They come in a large variety
of shapes colors and sizes with more than 1800 species known so far The key characteristic of sea stars
that distinguishes them from other echinoderm classes includes thick arms that extend from a central disk from
which various body organs branch into the arms At the end of each arm are simple eye spots and tentacles
that serve as touch receptors Sea stars use their rows of tube feet not only for gripping surfaces but also for
grasping prey Most sea stars are carnivores and their major prey are in the phylum Mollusca By manipulating
its tube feet a sea star can open molluscan shells Sea stars have two stomachs one of which can protrude
through their mouths and secrete digestive juices into or onto prey even before ingestion A sea star eating a
clam can partially open the shell and then evert its stomach into the shell introducing digestive enzymes into
the interior of the mollusk This process can both weaken the strong adductor closing muscles of a bivalve and
begin the process of digestion

Brittle stars belong to the class Ophiuroidea snaketails Unlike sea stars which have plump arms brittle stars
have long thin flexible arms that are sharply demarcated from the central disk Brittle stars move by lashing
out their arms or wrapping them around objects and pulling themselves forward Their arms are also used for
grasping prey The water vascular system in ophiuroids is not used for locomotion
Sea urchins and sand dollars are examples of Echinoidea prickly These echinoderms do not have arms but
are hemispherical or flattened with five rows of tube feet that extend through five rows of pores in a continuous
internal shell called a test Their tube feet are used to keep the body surface clean Skeletal plates around the
mouth are organized into a complex multipart feeding structure called Aristotles lantern Most echinoids graze
on algae but some are suspension feeders and others may feed on small animals or organic detritusthe
fragmentary remains of plants or animals
Sea lilies and feather stars are examples of Crinoidea Sea lilies are sessile with the body attached to a stalk
but the feather stars can actively move about using leglike cirri that emerge from the aboral surface Both types
of crinoid are suspension feeders collecting small food organisms along the ambulacral grooves of their feather
like arms The feathers consisted of branched arms lined with tube feet The tube feet are used to move
captured food toward the mouth There are only about 600 extant species of crinoids but they were far more
numerous and abundant in ancient oceans Many crinoids are deepwater species but feather stars typically
inhabit shallow areas especially in substropical and tropical waters
Sea cucumbers of class Holothuroidea exhibit an extended oralaboral axis These are the only echinoderms
that demonstrate functional bilateral symmetry as adults because the extended oralaboral axis compels the
animal to lie horizontally rather than stand vertically The tube feet are reduced or absent except on the side
on which the animal lies They have a single gonad and the digestive tract is more typical of a bilaterally
symmetrical animal A pair of gilllike structures called respiratory trees branch from the posterior gut muscles
