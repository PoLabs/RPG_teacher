The main differences between mitosis and meiosis occur in meiosis I which is a very different nuclear division
than mitosis In meiosis I the homologous chromosome pairs physically meet and are bound together with the
synaptonemal complex Following this the chromosomes develop chiasmata and undergo crossover between
nonsister chromatids In the end the chromosomes line up along the metaphase plate as tetradswith
kinetochore fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to each kinetochore of a homolog to form a tetrad All of
these events occur only in meiosis I
When the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another the
ploidy levelthe number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleushas been reduced from two to one
For this reason meiosis I is referred to as a reductional division There is no such reduction in ploidy level
during mitosis
Meiosis II is analogous to a mitotic division In this case the duplicated chromosomes only one set of them
line up on the metaphase plate with divided kinetochores attached to kinetochore fibers from opposite poles
During anaphase II as in mitotic anaphase the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatidnow referred to
as a chromosomeis pulled to one pole while the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole If it were
not for the fact that there had been crossover the two products of each individual meiosis II division would be
identical as in mitosis Instead they are different because there has always been at least one crossover per
chromosome Meiosis II is not a reduction division because although there are fewer copies of the genome in
the resulting cells there is still one set of chromosomes as there was at the end of meiosis I
Figure 117 Meiosis and mitosis are both preceded by one cycle of DNA replication however meiosis includes two
nuclear divisions The four daughter cells resulting from meiosis are haploid and genetically distinct The daughter cells
resulting from mitosis are diploid and identical to the parent cell
