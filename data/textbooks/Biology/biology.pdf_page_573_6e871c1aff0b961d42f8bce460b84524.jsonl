embedded in the viral envelope are used to attach to host cells Other envelope proteins are the matrix proteins
that stabilize the envelope and often play a role in the assembly of progeny virions Chicken pox HIV and
mumps are other examples of diseases caused by viruses with envelopes Because of the fragility of the
envelope nonenveloped viruses are more resistant to changes in temperature pH and some disinfectants than
enveloped viruses
Overall the shape of the virion and the presence or absence of an envelope tell us little about what disease
the virus may cause or what species it might infect but they are still useful means to begin viral classification
Figure 215
Figure 215 Complex Viruses Viruses can be either complex or relatively simple in shape This figure shows three
relatively complex virions the bacteriophage T4 with its DNAcontaining head group and tail fibers that attach
to host cells adenovirus which uses spikes from its capsid to bind to host cells and the influenza virus which
uses glycoproteins embedded in its envelope to bind to host cells The influenza virus also has matrix proteins
internal to the envelope which help stabilize the virions shape credit bacteriophage adenovirus modification

Which of the following statements about virus structure is true
a
All viruses are encased in a viral membrane
b
The capsomere is made up of small protein subunits called capsids
c
DNA is the genetic material in all viruses
d
Glycoproteins help the virus attach to the host cell
Types of Nucleic Acid
Unlike nearly all living organisms that use DNA as their genetic material viruses may use either DNA or RNA
The virus core contains the genomethe total genetic content of the virus Viral genomes tend to be small
containing only those genes that encode proteins which the virus cannot get from the host cell This genetic
material may be single or doublestranded It may also be linear or circular While most viruses contain a single
nucleic acid others have genomes divided into several segments The RNA genome of the influenza virus is
