presented together at the Linnean Society in 1858
It is difficult and timeconsuming to document and present examples of evolution by natural selection The
Galpagos finches are an excellent example Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have studied
Galpagos finch populations every year since 1976 and have provided important evidence of natural selection
The Grants found changes from one generation to the next in beak shape distribution with the medium ground
finch on the Galpagos island of Daphne Major The birds have inherited a variation in their bill shape with some
having wide deep bills and others having thinner bills During a period in which rainfall was higher than normal
because of an El Nio there was a lack of large hard seeds of which the largebilled birds ate however there
was an abundance of the small soft seeds which the smallbilled birds ate Therefore the smallbilled birds
were able to survive and reproduce In the years following this El Nio the Grants measured beak sizes in the
population and found that the average bill size was smaller Since bill size is an inherited trait parents with
smaller bills had more offspring and the bill evolved into a much smaller size As conditions improved in 1987
and larger seeds became more available the trend toward smaller average bill size ceased
