Figure 2946 Hominin phylogeny This chart shows the evolution of modern humans
Very Early Hominins
Three species of very early hominids have made news in the late 20th and early 21st centuries Ardipithecus
Sahelanthropus and Orrorin The youngest of the three species Ardipithecus was discovered in the 1990s and
dates to about 44 MYA Although the bipedality of the early specimens was uncertain several more specimens
of Ardipithecus were discovered in the intervening years and demonstrated that the organism was bipedal Two
different species of Ardipithecus have been identified A ramidus and A kadabba whose specimens are older
dating to 56 MYA However the status of this genus as a human ancestor is uncertain
The oldest of the three Sahelanthropus tchadensis was discovered in 20012002 and has been dated to nearly
seven million years ago There is a single specimen of this genus a skull that was a surface find in Chad The
fossil informally called Toumai is a mosaic of primitive and evolved characteristics and it is unclear how this
fossil fits with the picture given by molecular data namely that the line leading to modern humans and modern
chimpanzees apparently bifurcated about six million years ago It is not thought at this time that this species was
an ancestor of modern humans
A younger c 6 MYA species Orrorin tugenensis is also a relatively recent discovery found in 2000 There are
several specimens of Orrorin Some features of Orrorin are more similar to those of modern humans than are the
australopithicenes although Orrorin is much older If Orrorin is a human ancestor then the australopithicenes
may not be in the direct human lineage Additional specimens of these species may help to clarify their role
Early Hominins Genus Australopithecus
Australopithecus southern ape is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern Africa approximately four million
years ago and went extinct about two million years ago This genus is of particular interest to us as it is
thought that our genus genus Homo evolved from a common ancestor shared with Australopithecus about
two million years ago after likely passing through some transitional states Australopithecus had a number
of characteristics that were more similar to the great apes than to modern humans For example sexual
dimorphism was more exaggerated than in modern humans Males were up to 50 percent larger than females
