Figure 1218 The process of crossover or recombination occurs when two homologous chromosomes align during
meiosis and exchange a segment of genetic material Here the alleles for gene C were exchanged The result is two
recombinant and two nonrecombinant chromosomes
When two genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome they are considered linked and their
alleles tend to be transmitted through meiosis together To exemplify this imagine a dihybrid cross involving
flower color and plant height in which the genes are next to each other on the chromosome If one homologous
chromosome has alleles for tall plants and red flowers and the other chromosome has genes for short plants
and yellow flowers then when the gametes are formed the tall and red alleles will go together into a gamete and
the short and yellow alleles will go into other gametes These are called the parental genotypes because they
have been inherited intact from the parents of the individual producing gametes But unlike if the genes were on
different chromosomes there will be no gametes with tall and yellow alleles and no gametes with short and red
alleles If you create the Punnett square with these gametes you will see that the classical Mendelian prediction
of a 9331 outcome of a dihybrid cross would not apply As the distance between two genes increases the
probability of one or more crossovers between them increases and the genes behave more like they are
on separate chromosomes Geneticists have used the proportion of recombinant gametes the ones not like
the parents as a measure of how far apart genes are on a chromosome Using this information they have
constructed elaborate maps of genes on chromosomes for wellstudied organisms including humans
Mendels seminal publication makes no mention of linkage and many researchers have questioned whether
he encountered linkage but chose not to publish those crosses out of concern that they would invalidate his
independent assortment postulate The garden pea has seven chromosomes and some have suggested that
his choice of seven characteristics was not a coincidence However even if the genes he examined were not
located on separate chromosomes it is possible that he simply did not observe linkage because of the extensive
shuffling effects of recombination
