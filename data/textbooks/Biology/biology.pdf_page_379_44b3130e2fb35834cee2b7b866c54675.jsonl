Figure 136 Nondisjunction occurs when homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during
meiosis resulting in an abnormal chromosome number Nondisjunction may occur during meiosis I or meiosis II
Which of the following statements about nondisjunction is true
a
Nondisjunction only results in gametes with n1 or n1 chromosomes
b
Nondisjunction occurring during meiosis II results in 50 percent normal gametes
c
Nondisjunction during meiosis I results in 50 percent normal gametes
d
Nondisjunction always results in four different kinds of gametes
Aneuploidy
Scientists call an individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species euploid In humans
euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes An individual with an error
in chromosome number is described as aneuploid a term that includes monosomy losing one chromosome
or trisomy gaining an extraneous chromosome Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an
autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential genes This underscores the importance
of gene dosage in humans Most autosomal trisomies also fail to develop to birth however duplications of
some smaller chromosomes 13 15 18 21 or 22 can result in offspring that survive for several weeks to many
years Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance an excess in gene dose Individuals
with an extra chromosome may synthesize an abundance of the gene products which that chromosome
encodes This extra dose 150 percent of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and
often precludes development The most common trisomy among viable births is that of chromosome 21 which
corresponds to Down Syndrome Short stature and stunted digits facial distinctions that include a broad skull
and large tongue and significant developmental delays characterize individuals with this inherited disorder We
can correlate the incidence of Down syndrome with maternal age Older women are more likely to become
pregnant with fetuses carrying the trisomy 21 genotype Figure 137
