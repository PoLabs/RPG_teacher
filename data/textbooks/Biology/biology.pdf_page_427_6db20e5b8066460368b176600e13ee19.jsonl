RNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs
that includes the 5S prerRNA transfer preRNAs pretRNAs and small nuclear pre RNAs The tRNAs
have a critical role in translation they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mRNA template and the
growing polypeptide chain Small nuclear RNAs have a variety of functions including splicing premRNAs and
regulating transcription factors
A scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase transcribes it by testing whether the gene
is expressed in the presence of amanitin an oligopeptide toxin produced by the fly agaric toadstool mushroom
and other species of Amanita Interestingly the amanitin affects the three polymerases very differently Table
151 RNA polymerase I is completely insensitive to amanitin meaning that the polymerase can transcribe
DNA in vitro in the presence of this poison RNA polymerase III is moderately sensitive to the toxin In contrast
RNA polymerase II is extremely sensitive to amanitin The toxin prevents the enzyme from progressing down
the DNA and thus inhibits transcription Knowing the transcribing polymerase can provide clues as to the
general function of the gene being studied Because RNA polymerase II transcribes the vast majority of genes
we will focus on this polymerase in our subsequent discussions about eukaryotic transcription factors and
promoters
RNA Polymerase II Promoters and Transcription Factors
Eukaryotic promoters are much larger and more intricate than prokaryotic promoters However both have a
sequence similar to the 10 sequence of prokaryotes In eukaryotes this sequence is called the TATA box and
has the consensus sequence TATAAA on the coding strand It is located at 25 to 35 bases relative to the
initiation 1 site Figure 1510 This sequence is not identical to the E coli 10 box but it conserves the
AT rich element The thermostability of AT bonds is low and this helps the DNA template to locally unwind in
preparation for transcription
Instead of the simple  factor that helps bind the prokaryotic RNA polymerase to its promoter eukaryotes
assemble a complex of transcription factors required to recruit RNA polymerase II to a protein coding gene
Transcription factors that bind to the promoter are called basal transcription factors These basal factors are all
called TFII for Transcription Factorpolymerase II plus an additional letter AJ The core complex is TFIID
which includes a TATAbinding protein TBP The other transcription factors systematically fall into place on the
DNA template with each one further stabilizing the preinitiation complex and contributing to the recruitment of
RNA polymerase II
