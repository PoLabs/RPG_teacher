A pheromone is a secreted chemical signal used to obtain a response from another individual of the same
species The purpose of pheromones is to elicit a specific behavior from the receiving individual Pheromones
are especially common among social insects but they are used by many species to attract the opposite sex
to sound alarms to mark food trails and to elicit other more complex behaviors Even humans are thought to
respond to certain pheromones called axillary steroids These chemicals influence human perception of other
people and in one study were responsible for a group of women synchronizing their menstrual cycles The role
of pheromones in humantohuman communication is not fully understood and continues to be researched
Songs are an example of an aural signal one that needs to be heard by the recipient Perhaps the best known
of these are songs of birds which identify the species and are used to attract mates Other wellknown songs
are those of whales which are of such low frequency that they can travel long distances underwater Dolphin
species communicate with each other and occasionally even with other species of dolphins using a wide variety
of vocalizations Male crickets make chirping sounds using a specialized organ to attract a mate repel other
males and to announce a successful mating
Courtship displays are a series of ritualized visual behaviors signals designed to attract and convince a
member of the opposite sex to mate These displays are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom Often these displays
involve a series of steps including an initial display by one member followed by a response from the other If at
any point the display is performed incorrectly or a proper response is not given the mating ritual is abandoned
and the mating attempt will be unsuccessful The mating display of the common stork is shown in Figure 4537
Aggressive displays are also common in the animal kingdom For example a dog bares its teeth when it
wants another dog to back down Presumably these displays communicate not only the willingness of the animal
to fight but also its fighting ability Although these displays do signal aggression on the part of the sender it
is thought that these displays are actually a mechanism to reduce the amount of actual fighting that occurs
between members of the same species they allow individuals to assess the fighting ability of their opponent and
thus decide whether it is worth the fight The testing of certain hypotheses using game theory has led to the
conclusion that some of these displays may overstate an animals actual fighting ability and are used to bluff
the opponent This type of interaction even if dishonest would be favored by natural selection if it is successful
more times than not

Distraction displays are seen in birds and some fish They are designed to attract a predator away from the
nest This is an example of an altruistic behavior it benefits the young more than the individual performing the
display which is putting itself at risk by doing so
Many animals especially primates communicate with other members in the group through touch Activities such
as grooming touching the shoulder or root of the tail embracing lip contact and greeting ceremonies have
all been observed in the Indian langur an Old World monkey Similar behaviors are found in other primates
especially in the great apes
