CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
19 The Triassic Period was marked by the increase
in number and variety of angiosperms Insects also
diversified enormously during the same period Can
you propose the reason or reasons that could foster
coevolution
20 What role did the adaptations of seed and pollen
play in the development and expansion of seed
plants
21 The Mediterranean landscape along the sea
shore is dotted with pines and cypresses The
weather is not cold and the trees grow at sea level
What evolutionary adaptation of conifers makes them
suitable to the Mediterranean climate
22 What are the four modernday phyla of
gymnosperms
23 Some cycads are considered endangered
species and their trade is severely restricted
Customs officials stop suspected smugglers who
claim that the plants in their possession are palm
trees not cycads How would a botanist distinguish
