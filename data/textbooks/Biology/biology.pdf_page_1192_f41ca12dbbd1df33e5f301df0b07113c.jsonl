allowing for movement The skeletal system in vertebrates is divided into the axial skeleton which consists of
the skull vertebral column and rib cage and the appendicular skeleton which consists of the shoulders limb
bones the pectoral girdle and the pelvic girdle

Human Axial Skeleton
The axial skeleton forms the central axis of the body and includes the bones of the skull ossicles of the middle
ear hyoid bone of the throat vertebral column and the thoracic cage ribcage Figure 385 The function of
the axial skeleton is to provide support and protection for the brain the spinal cord and the organs in the ventral
body cavity It provides a surface for the attachment of muscles that move the head neck and trunk performs
respiratory movements and stabilizes parts of the appendicular skeleton

The Skull
The bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain The skull consists of 22 bones
which are divided into two categories cranial bones and facial bones The cranial bones are eight bones that
form the cranial cavity which encloses the brain and serves as an attachment site for the muscles of the head
and neck The eight cranial bones are the frontal bone two parietal bones two temporal bones occipital bone
sphenoid bone and the ethmoid bone Although the bones developed separately in the embryo and fetus in the
adult they are tightly fused with connective tissue and adjoining bones do not move Figure 386
