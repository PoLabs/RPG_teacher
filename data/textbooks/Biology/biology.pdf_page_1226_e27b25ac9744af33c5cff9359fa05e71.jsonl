movement of a bone upward such as when the shoulders are shrugged lifting the scapulae
process of bone development from hyaline cartilage
skeleton of living cells that produces a hard mineralized tissue located within the soft tissue of
organisms
region between the diaphysis and epiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of
long bones
rounded end of bone covered with articular cartilage and filled with red bone marrow which
produces blood cells
movement of the sole of the foot outward away from the midline of the body opposite of inversion
a secreted cellular product external skeleton that consists of a hard encasement on the surface of
an organism
movement in which the angle between the bones of a joint increases opposite of flexion
one of the 14 bones that form the face provides cavities for the sense organs eyes mouth and
nose and attachment points for facial muscles
also thighbone longest heaviest and strongest bone in the body
joint held together by fibrous connective tissue
also calf bone parallels and articulates with the tibia
thin and relatively broad bone found where extensive protection of organs is required or where broad
surfaces of muscle attachment are required
movement in which the angle between the bones decreases opposite of extension
extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones the ulna and the radius
when relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other
the joint in which the tooth fits into the socket like a peg
contains the bones blood vessels and nerve fibers
slightly rounded end of one bone fits into the slightly hollow end of the other bone
only bone of the arm
skeleton that consists of aqueous fluid held under pressure in a closed body
compartment
lies below the mandible in the front of the neck
extension past the regular anatomical position
composed of fibrous cartilage lies between adjacent vertebrae from the second cervical
vertebra to the sacrum
process of bone development from fibrous membranes
soles of the feet moving inward toward the midline of the body
bone with complex shapes examples include vertebrae and hip bones
point at which two or more bones meet
