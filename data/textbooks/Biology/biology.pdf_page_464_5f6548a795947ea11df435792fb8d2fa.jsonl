cellular activity Too many miRNAs could dramatically decrease the RNA population leading to a decrease in
protein expression Several studies have demonstrated a change in the miRNA population in specific cancer
types It appears that the subset of miRNAs expressed in breast cancer cells is quite different from the subset
expressed in lung cancer cells or even from normal breast cells This suggests that alterations in miRNA activity
can contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells These types of studies also suggest that if some miRNAs
are specifically expressed only in cancer cells they could be potential drug targets It would therefore be
conceivable that new drugs that turn off miRNA expression in cancer could be an effective method to treat
cancer
Cancer and TranslationalPosttranslational Control
There are many examples of how translational or posttranslational modifications of proteins arise in cancer
Modifications are found in cancer cells from the increased translation of a protein to changes in protein
phosphorylation to alternative splice variants of a protein An example of how the expression of an alternative
form of a protein can have dramatically different outcomes is seen in colon cancer cells The cFlip protein a
protein involved in mediating the celldeath pathway comes in two forms long cFLIPL and short cFLIPS
Both forms appear to be involved in initiating controlled celldeath mechanisms in normal cells However in
colon cancer cells expression of the long form results in increased cell growth instead of cell death Clearly the
expression of the wrong protein dramatically alters cell function and contributes to the development of cancer
New Drugs to Combat Cancer Targeted Therapies
Scientists are using what is known about the regulation of gene expression in disease states including cancer to
develop new ways to treat and prevent disease development Many scientists are designing drugs on the basis
of the gene expression patterns within individual tumors This idea that therapy and medicines can be tailored
to an individual has given rise to the field of personalized medicine With an increased understanding of gene
regulation and gene function medicines can be designed to specifically target diseased cells without harming
healthy cells Some new medicines called targeted therapies have exploited the overexpression of a specific
protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat disease One such example is the use
of antiEGF receptor medications to treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have very high levels of the
EGF protein Undoubtedly more targeted therapies will be developed as scientists learn more about how gene
expression changes can cause cancer
Clinical Trial Coordinator
A clinical trial coordinator is the person managing the proceedings of the clinical trial This job includes
coordinating patient schedules and appointments maintaining detailed notes building the database to track
patients especially for longterm followup studies ensuring proper documentation has been acquired and
accepted and working with the nurses and doctors to facilitate the trial and publication of the results A
clinical trial coordinator may have a science background like a nursing degree or other certification People
who have worked in science labs or in clinical offices are also qualified to become a clinical trial coordinator
These jobs are generally in hospitals however some clinics and doctors offices also conduct clinical trials
and may hire a coordinator
