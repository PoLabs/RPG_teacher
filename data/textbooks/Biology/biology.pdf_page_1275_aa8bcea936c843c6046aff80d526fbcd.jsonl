The autonomous beating of cardiac muscle cells is regulated by the hearts internal pacemaker that uses
electrical signals to time the beating of the heart The electrical signals and mechanical actions illustrated in
Figure 4014 are intimately intertwined The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial SA node which is
located near the wall of the right atrium Electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the
two atria to contract in unison The pulse reaches a second node called the atrioventricular AV node between
the right atrium and right ventricle where it pauses for approximately 01 second before spreading to the walls of
the ventricles From the AV node the electrical impulse enters the bundle of His then to the left and right bundle
branches extending through the interventricular septum Finally the Purkinje fibers conduct the impulse from the
apex of the heart up the ventricular myocardium and then the ventricles contract This pause allows the atria
to empty completely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood The electrical impulses in the
heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using electrodes
This information can be observed as an electrocardiogram ECGa recording of the electrical impulses of the
cardiac muscle
