A prokaryote is a simple mostly singlecelled unicellular organism that lacks a nucleus or any other
membranebound organelle We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes
Prokaryotic DNA is in the cells central part the nucleoid Figure 45
Figure 45 This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell All prokaryotes have chromosomal DNA
localized in a nucleoid ribosomes a cell membrane and a cell wall The other structures shown are present in some
but not all bacteria
Most prokaryotes have a peptidoglycan cell wall and many have a polysaccharide capsule Figure 45 The
cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection helps the cell maintain its shape and prevents dehydration The
capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its environment Some prokaryotes have flagella pili or fimbriae
Flagella are used for locomotion Pili exchange genetic material during conjugation the process by which one
bacterium transfers genetic material to another through direct contact Bacteria use fimbriae to attach to a host
cell
Microbiologist
The most effective action anyone can take to prevent the spread of contagious illnesses is to wash his or
her hands Why Because microbes organisms so tiny that they can only be seen with microscopes are
ubiquitous They live on doorknobs money your hands and many other surfaces If someone sneezes
into his hand and touches a doorknob and afterwards you touch that same doorknob the microbes from
the sneezers mucus are now on your hands If you touch your hands to your mouth nose or eyes those
microbes can enter your body and could make you sick
However not all microbes also called microorganisms cause disease most are actually beneficial You
have microbes in your gut that make vitamin K Other microorganisms are used to ferment beer and wine
Microbiologists are scientists who study microbes Microbiologists can pursue a number of careers Not only
do they work in the food industry they are also employed in the veterinary and medical fields They can work
in the pharmaceutical sector serving key roles in research and development by identifying new antibiotic
sources that can treat bacterial infections
Environmental microbiologists may look for new ways to use specially selected or genetically engineered
microbes to remove pollutants from soil or groundwater as well as hazardous elements from contaminated
sites We call using these microbes bioremediation technologies Microbiologists can also work in the
bioinformatics field providing specialized knowledge and insight for designing developing and specificity
of computer models of for example bacterial epidemics
Cell Size
At 01 to 50 m in diameter prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells which have
diameters ranging from 10 to 100 m Figure 46 The prokaryotes small size allows ions and organic
