Figure 192 When populations are in the HardyWeinberg equilibrium the allelic frequency is stable from
generation to generation and we can determine the allele distribution from the HardyWeinberg equation If the
allelic frequency measured in the field differs from the predicted value scientists can make inferences about what
evolutionary forces are at play
In plants violet flower color V is dominant over white v If p  08 and q  02 in a population of 500
plants how many individuals would you expect to be homozygous dominant VV heterozygous Vv and
homozygous recessive vv How many plants would you expect to have violet flowers and how many
would have white flowers
In theory if a population is at equilibriumthat is there are no evolutionary forces acting upon itgeneration
after generation would have the same gene pool and genetic structure and these equations would all hold
true all of the time Of course even Hardy and Weinberg recognized that no natural population is immune
to evolution Populations in nature are constantly changing in genetic makeup due to drift mutation possibly
migration and selection As a result the only way to determine the exact distribution of phenotypes in a
population is to go out and count them However the HardyWeinberg principle gives scientists a mathematical
baseline of a nonevolving population to which they can compare evolving populations and thereby infer what
evolutionary forces might be at play If the frequencies of alleles or genotypes deviate from the value expected
