19 Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo is a
disorder where some of the calcium carbonate
crystals in the utricle migrate into the semicircular
canals Why does this condition cause periods of
dizziness
a
The hair cells in the semicircular canals will
be constantly activated
b
The hair cells in the semicircular canals will
now be stimulated by gravity
c
The utricle will no longer recognize
acceleration

semicircular canals for them to detect
motion
