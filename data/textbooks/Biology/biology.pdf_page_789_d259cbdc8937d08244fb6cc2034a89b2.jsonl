Figure 2714 An evolutionary timeline a Earths history is divided into eons eras and periods Note that the
Ediacaran period starts in the Proterozoic eon and ends in the Cambrian period of the Phanerozoic eon b Stages on

Most Ediacaran biota were just a few mm or cm long but some of the featherlike forms could reach lengths of
over a meter Recently there has been increasing scientific evidence suggesting that more varied and complex
animal species lived during this time and likely even before the Ediacaran period
Fossils believed to represent the oldest animals with hard body parts were recently discovered in South
Australia These spongelike fossils named Coronacollina acula date back as far as 560 million years and are
believed to show the existence of hard body parts and spicules that extended 2040 cm from the thimbleshaped
body estimated about 5 cm long Other fossils from the Ediacaran period are shown in Figure 2715a b c

Another recent fossil discovery may represent the earliest animal species ever found While the validity of this
claim is still under investigation these primitive fossils appear to be small onecentimeter long spongelike
creatures irregularly shaped and with internal tubes or canals These ancient fossils from South Australia date
back 650 million years actually placing the putative animal before the great ice age extinction event that marked
the transition between the Cryogenian period and the Ediacaran period Until this discovery most scientists
believed that there was no animal life prior to the Ediacaran period Many scientists now believe that animals
may in fact have evolved during the Cryogenian period
The Cambrian Explosion of Animal Life
If the fossils of the Ediacaran and Cryogenian periods are enigmatic those of the following Cambrian period
are far less so and include body forms similar to those living today The Cambrian period occurring between
approximately 542488 million years ago marks the most rapid evolution of new animal phyla and animal
diversity in Earths history The rapid diversification of animals that appeared during this period including most
of the animal phyla in existence today is often referred to as the Cambrian explosion Figure 2716 Animals
resembling echinoderms mollusks worms arthropods and chordates arose during this period What may have
been a top predator of this period was an arthropodlike creature named Anomalocaris over a meter long
