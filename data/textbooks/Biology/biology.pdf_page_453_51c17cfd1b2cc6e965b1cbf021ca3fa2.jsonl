Figure 166 DNA is folded around histone proteins to create a nucleosome complexes These nucleosomes control
the access of proteins to the underlying DNA When viewed through an electron microscope b the nucleosomes look
like beads on a string credit micrograph modification of work by Chris Woodcock
These beads histone proteins can move along the string DNA to expose different sections of the molecule If
DNA encoding a specific gene is to be transcribed into RNA the nucleosomes surrounding that region of DNA
can slide down the DNA to open that specific chromosomal region and allow for the transcriptional machinery
RNA polymerase to initiate transcription Figure 167
Figure 167 Nucleosomes can slide along DNA When nucleosomes are spaced closely together top
transcription factors cannot bind and gene expression is turned off When the nucleosomes are spaced far apart
bottom the DNA is exposed Transcription factors can bind allowing gene expression to occur Modifications to
the histones and DNA affect nucleosome spacing
In females one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated during embryonic development because of
epigenetic changes to the chromatin What impact do you think these changes would have on nucleosome
packing
