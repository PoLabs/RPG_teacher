Figure 186 In this a display fossil hominids are arranged from oldest bottom to newest top As hominids evolved
the skulls shape changed An artists rendition of b extinct species of the genus Equus reveals that these ancient
species resembled the modern horse Equus ferus but varied in size

Another type of evidence for evolution is the presence of structures in organisms that share the same basic form
For example the bones in human dog bird and whale appendages all share the same overall construction
Figure 187 resulting from their origin in a common ancestors appendages Over time evolution led to
changes in the bones shapes and sizes different species but they have maintained the same overall layout
Scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures
Figure 187 The similar construction of these appendages indicates that these organisms share a common ancestor
Some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all and appear to be residual parts from a
past common ancestor We call these unused structures without function vestigial structures Other examples
of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds leaves on some cacti and hind leg bones in whales
Visit this interactive site httpopenstaxcollegeorglbone_structures to guess which bone structures
are homologous and which are analogous and see examples of evolutionary adaptations to illustrate these
concepts
Another evidence of evolution is the convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments For
example species of unrelated animals such as the arctic fox and ptarmigan living in the arctic region have
been selected for seasonal white phenotypes during winter to blend with the snow and ice Figure 188 These
