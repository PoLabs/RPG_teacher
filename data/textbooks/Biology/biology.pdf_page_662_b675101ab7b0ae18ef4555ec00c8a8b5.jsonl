Figure 2325 Conjugation in Paramecium The complex process of sexual reproduction in Paramecium creates
eight daughter cells from two original cells Each cell has a macronucleus and a micronucleus During sexual
reproduction the macronucleus dissolves and is replaced by a micronucleus credit micrograph modification of
work by Ian Sutton scalebar data from Matt Russell
Which of the following statements about Paramecium sexual reproduction is false
a
The macronuclei are derived from micronuclei
b
Both mitosis and meiosis occur during sexual reproduction
c
The conjugate pair swaps macronucleii
d
Each parent produces four daughter cells
Stramenopiles Diatoms Brown Algae Golden Algae and Oomycetes
The other subgroup of chromalveolates the stramenopiles includes photosynthetic marine algae and
heterotrophic protists The chloroplast of these algae is derived from red alga The identifying feature of this
group is the presence of a textured or hairy flagellum Many stramenopiles also have an additional flagellum
