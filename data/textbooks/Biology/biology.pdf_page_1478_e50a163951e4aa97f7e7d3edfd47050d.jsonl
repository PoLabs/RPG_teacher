ecosystem which affects the ecosystem overall Furthermore as humans have the ability to greatly and rapidly
alter the species content and habitat of an ecosystem the need for predictive models that enable understanding
of how ecosystems respond to these changes becomes more crucial
Analytical models often use simple linear components of ecosystems such as food chains and are known to be
complex mathematically therefore they require a significant amount of mathematical knowledge and expertise
Although analytical models have great potential their simplification of complex ecosystems is thought to limit
their accuracy Simulation models that use computer programs are better able to deal with the complexities of
ecosystem structure
A recent development in simulation modeling uses supercomputers to create and run individualbased
simulations which accounts for the behavior of individual organisms and their effects on the ecosystem as a
whole These simulations are considered to be the most accurate and predictive of the complex responses of
ecosystems to disturbances

462  Energy Flow through Ecosystems
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how organisms acquire energy in a food web and in associated food chains

Explain how the efficiency of energy transfers between trophic levels affects ecosystem structure and
dynamics

Discuss trophic levels and how ecological pyramids are used to model them
All living things require energy in one form or another Energy is required by most complex metabolic pathways
often in the form of adenosine triphosphate ATP especially those responsible for building large molecules
from smaller compounds and life itself is an energydriven process Living organisms would not be able to
assemble macromolecules proteins lipids nucleic acids and complex carbohydrates from their monomeric
subunits without a constant energy input
It is important to understand how organisms acquire energy and how that energy is passed from one organism to
another through food webs and their constituent food chains Food webs illustrate how energy flows directionally
through ecosystems including how efficiently organisms acquire it use it and how much remains for use by
other organisms of the food web
How Organisms Acquire Energy in a Food Web
Energy is acquired by living things in three ways photosynthesis chemosynthesis and the consumption and
digestion of other living or previously living organisms by heterotrophs
Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms are both grouped into a category known as autotrophs
organisms capable of synthesizing their own food more specifically capable of using inorganic carbon as
a carbon source Photosynthetic autotrophs photoautotrophs use sunlight as an energy source whereas
chemosynthetic autotrophs chemoautotrophs use inorganic molecules as an energy source Autotrophs are
critical for all ecosystems Without these organisms energy would not be available to other living organisms and
life itself would not be possible
Photoautotrophs such as plants algae and photosynthetic bacteria serve as the energy source for a majority of
the worlds ecosystems These ecosystems are often described by grazing food webs Photoautotrophs harness
