Age structures of areas with slow growth including developed countries such as the United States still have a
pyramidal structure but with many fewer young and reproductiveaged individuals and a greater proportion of
older individuals Other developed countries such as Italy have zero population growth The age structure of
these populations is more conical with an even greater percentage of middleaged and older individuals The
actual growth rates in different countries are shown in Figure 4517 with the highest rates tending to be in the
less economically developed countries of Africa and Asia
Figure 4516 Typical age structure diagrams are shown The rapid growth diagram narrows to a point indicating
that the number of individuals decreases rapidly with age In the slow growth model the number of individuals
decreases steadily with age Stable population diagrams are rounded on the top showing that the number of
individuals per age group decreases gradually and then increases for the older part of the population
Age structure diagrams for rapidly growing slow growing and stable populations are shown in stages 1
through 3 What type of population change do you think stage 4 represents
Figure 4517 The percent growth rate of population in different countries is shown Notice that the highest growth is
occurring in less economically developed countries in Africa and Asia
LongTerm Consequences of Exponential Human Population Growth
Many dire predictions have been made about the worlds population leading to a major crisis called the
population explosion In the 1968 book The Population Bomb biologist Dr Paul R Ehrlich wrote The battle
to feed all of humanity is over In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any
crash programs embarked upon now At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world

While many experts view this statement as incorrect based on evidence the laws of exponential
population growth are still in effect and unchecked human population growth cannot continue indefinitely
Several nations have instituted policies aimed at influencing population Efforts to control population growth led
