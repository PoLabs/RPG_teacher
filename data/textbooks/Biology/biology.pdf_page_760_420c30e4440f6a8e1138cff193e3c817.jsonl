Eudicots
Eudicots or true dicots are characterized by the presence of two cotyledons in the developing shoot Veins
form a network in leaves and flower parts come in four five or many whorls Vascular tissue forms a ring in
the stem in monocots vascular tissue is scattered in the stem Eudicots can be herbaceous not woody or
produce woody tissues Most eudicots produce pollen that is trisulcate or triporate with three furrows or pores
The root system is usually anchored by one main root developed from the embryonic radicle Eudicots comprise
twothirds of all flowering plants The major differences between monocots and eudicots are summarized in
Table 261 However some species may exhibit characteristics usually associated with the other group so
identification of a plant as a monocot or a eudicot is not always straightforward
