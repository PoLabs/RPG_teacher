The Prokaryotic Cell
Recall that prokaryotes are unicellular organisms that lack membranebound organelles or other internal
membranebound structures Figure 2210 Their chromosomeusually singleconsists of a piece of circular
doublestranded DNA located in an area of the cell called the nucleoid Most prokaryotes have a cell wall
outside the plasma membrane The cell wall functions as a protective layer and it is responsible for the
organisms shape Some bacterial species have a capsule outside the cell wall The capsule enables the
organism to attach to surfaces protects it from dehydration and attack by phagocytic cells and makes
pathogens more resistant to our immune responses Some species also have flagella singular flagellum used
for locomotion and pili singular pilus used for attachment to surfaces including the surfaces of other cells
Plasmids which consist of extrachromosomal DNA are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea
Figure 2210 The features of a typical prokaryotic cell Flagella capsules and pili are not found in all prokaryotes
Recall that prokaryotes are divided into two different domains Bacteria and Archaea which together with
Eukarya comprise the three domains of life Figure 2211
