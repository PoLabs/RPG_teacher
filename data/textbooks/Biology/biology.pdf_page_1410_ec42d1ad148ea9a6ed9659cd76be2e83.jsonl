carbon dioxide has increased from about 280 ppm to 382 ppm in 2006 In 2011 the atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentration was 392 ppm However the planet would not be inhabitable by current life forms if water vapor did
not produce its drastic greenhouse warming effect
Scientists look at patterns in data and try to explain differences or deviations from these patterns The
atmospheric carbon dioxide data reveal a historical pattern of carbon dioxide increasing and decreasing cycling
between a low of 180 ppm and a high of 300 ppm Scientists have concluded that it took around 50000 years
for the atmospheric carbon dioxide level to increase from its low minimum concentration to its higher maximum
concentration However beginning only a few centuries ago atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have
increased beyond the historical maximum of 300 ppm The current increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide have
happened very quicklyin a matter of hundreds of years rather than thousands of years What is the reason for
this difference in the rate of change and the amount of increase in carbon dioxide A key factor that must be
recognized when comparing the historical data and the current data is the presence and industrial activities of
modern human society no other driver of climate change has yielded changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide
levels at this rate or to this magnitude
Human activity releases carbon dioxide and methane two of the most important greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere in several ways The primary mechanism that releases carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil
fuels such as gasoline coal and natural gas Figure 4429 Deforestation cement manufacture animal
agriculture the clearing of land and the burning of forests are other human activities that release carbon dioxide
Methane CH4 is produced when bacteria break down organic matter under anaerobic conditions Anaerobic
conditions can happen when organic matter is trapped underwater such as in rice paddies or in the intestines
of herbivores Methane can also be released from natural gas fields and the decomposition of animal and plant
material that occurs in landfills Another source of methane is the melting of clathrates Clathrates are frozen
chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean When water warms these chunks of ice melt
and methane is released As the oceans water temperature increases the rate at which clathrates melt is
increasing releasing even more methane This leads to increased levels of methane in the atmosphere which
further accelerates the rate of global warming This is an example of the positive feedback loop that is leading to
the rapid rate of increase of global temperatures

Documented Results of Climate Change Past and Present
Scientists have geological evidence of the consequences of longago climate change Modernday phenomena
such as retreating glaciers and melting polar ice cause a continual rise in sea level Meanwhile changes in
climate can negatively affect organisms
