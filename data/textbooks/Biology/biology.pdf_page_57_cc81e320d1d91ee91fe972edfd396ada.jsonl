Water is a polar molecule with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial
negative charge This occurs because the oxygen atoms nucleus is more attractive to the hydrogen atoms
electrons than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygens electrons Thus oxygen has a higher electronegativity
than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen atoms
nucleus giving the oxygen and hydrogen atoms slightly negative and positive charges respectively Another
way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than
finding it near a hydrogen nucleus Either way the atoms relative electronegativity contributes to developing
partial charges whenever one element is significantly more electronegative than the other and the charges that
these polar bonds generate may then be used to form hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite
partial charges Hydrogen bonds which we discuss in detail below are weak bonds between slightly positively
charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively charged atoms in other molecules Since macromolecules often
have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity polar bonds are often present in organic molecules
Nonpolar Covalent Bonds
Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that
share electrons equally For example molecular oxygen O2 is nonpolar because the electrons distribute
equally between the two oxygen atoms
Figure 212 also shows another example of a nonpolar covalent bondmethane CH4 Carbon has four
electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it It obtains these four from four hydrogen atoms each
atom providing one making a stable outer shell of eight electrons Carbon and hydrogen do not have the same
electronegativity but are similar thus nonpolar bonds form The hydrogen atoms each need one electron for
their outermost shell which is filled when it contains two electrons These elements share the electrons equally
among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms creating a nonpolar covalent molecule
Figure 212 Whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar depends both on bond type and molecular shape Both water and
carbon dioxide have polar covalent bonds but carbon dioxide is linear so the partial charges on the molecule cancel
each other out
Hydrogen Bonds and Van Der Waals Interactions
Ionic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent
which determines their behavior in biological systems However not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds
Weaker bonds can also form between molecules Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds
and van der Waals interactions Without these two types of bonds life as we know it would not exist Hydrogen
bonds provide many of the critical lifesustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins
and DNA the building block of cells
When polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge
because hydrogens electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen
Because the hydrogen is slightly positive it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges When this
happens a weak interaction occurs between the hydrogens  from one molecule and another molecules
