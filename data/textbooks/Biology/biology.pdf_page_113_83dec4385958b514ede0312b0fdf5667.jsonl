CHAPTER SUMMARY
31 Synthesis of Biological Macromolecules
Proteins carbohydrates nucleic acids and lipids are the four major classes of biological
macromoleculeslarge molecules necessary for life that are built from smaller organic molecules
Macromolecules are comprised of single units scientists call monomers that are joined by covalent bonds to
form larger polymers The polymer is more than the sum of its parts it acquires new characteristics and leads
to an osmotic pressure that is much lower than that formed by its ingredients This is an important advantage in
maintaining cellular osmotic conditions A monomer joins with another monomer with water molecule release
leading to a covalent bond forming Scientists call these dehydration or condensation reactions When
polymers break down into smaller units monomers they use a water molecule for each bond broken by these
reactions Such reactions are hydrolysis reactions Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are similar for all
macromolecules but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific to its class Dehydration reactions
typically require an investment of energy for new bond formation while hydrolysis reactions typically release
energy by breaking bonds
32 Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are a group of macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the cell and provide structural
support to plant cells fungi and all of the arthropods that include lobsters crabs shrimp insects and spiders
Scientists classify carbohydrates as monosaccharides disaccharides and polysaccharides depending on the
number of monomers in the molecule Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds that form as a result of
dehydration reactions forming disaccharides and polysaccharides with eliminating a water molecule for each
bond formed Glucose galactose and fructose are common monosaccharides whereas common
disaccharides include lactose maltose and sucrose Starch and glycogen examples of polysaccharides are
the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals respectively The long polysaccharide chains may be
branched or unbranched Cellulose is an example of an unbranched polysaccharide whereas amylopectin a
constituent of starch is a highly branched molecule Glucose storage in the form of polymers like starch of
glycogen makes it slightly less accessible for metabolism however this prevents it from leaking out of the cell
or creating a high osmotic pressure that could cause the cell to uptake excessive water
33 Lipids
Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature Major types include fats and
oils waxes phospholipids and steroids Fats are a stored form of energy and are also known as
triacylglycerols or triglycerides Fats are comprised of fatty acids and either glycerol or sphingosine Fatty acids
may be unsaturated or saturated depending on the presence or absence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon
chain If only single bonds are present they are saturated fatty acids Unsaturated fatty acids may have one or
more double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain Phospholipids comprise the membranes matrix They have a
glycerol or sphingosine backbone to which two fatty acid chains and a phosphatecontaining group are
attached Steroids are another class of lipids Their basic structure has four fused carbon rings Cholesterol is a
type of steroid and is an important constituent of the plasma membrane where it helps to maintain the
membranes fluid nature It is also the precursor of steroid hormones such as testosterone
34 Proteins
Proteins are a class of macromolecules that perform a diverse range of functions for the cell They help in
metabolism by acting as enzymes carriers or hormones and provide structural support The building blocks of
proteins monomers are amino acids Each amino acid has a central carbon that bonds to an amino group a
carboxyl group a hydrogen atom and an R group or side chain There are 20 commonly occurring amino
acids each of which differs in the R group A peptide bond links each amino acid to its neighbors A long amino
acid chain is a polypeptide
Proteins are organized at four levels primary secondary tertiary and optional quaternary The primary
structure is the amino acids unique sequence The polypeptides local folding to form structures such as the
helix and pleated sheet constitutes the secondary structure The overall threedimensional structure is the
tertiary structure When two or more polypeptides combine to form the complete protein structure the
configuration is the proteins quaternary structure Protein shape and function are intricately linked Any change
in shape caused by changes in temperature or pH may lead to protein denaturation and a loss in function
