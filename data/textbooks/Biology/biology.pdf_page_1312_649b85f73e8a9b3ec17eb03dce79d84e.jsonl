421  Innate Immune Response
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe physical and chemical immune barriers

Explain immediate and induced innate immune responses

Discuss natural killer cells

Describe major histocompatibility class I molecules

Summarize how the proteins in a complement system function to destroy extracellular pathogens
The immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses Innate immunity occurs naturally
because of genetic factors or physiology it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to reduce the
workload for the adaptive immune response Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve
secreted proteins receptormediated signaling and intricate celltocell communication The innate immune
system developed early in animal evolution roughly a billion years ago as an essential response to infection
Innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets any pathogenic threat triggers a consistent sequence
of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection independently or mobilize a highly
specialized adaptive immune response For example tears and mucus secretions contain microbicidal factors
Physical and Chemical Barriers
Before any immune factors are triggered the skin functions as a continuous impassable barrier to potentially
infectious pathogens Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation drying out and by the
skins acidity In addition beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with invading pathogens
preventing infection Regions of the body that are not protected by skin such as the eyes and mucus
membranes have alternative methods of defense such as tears and mucus secretions that trap and rinse away
pathogens and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push the mucus with the pathogens out of
the body Throughout the body are other defenses such as the low pH of the stomach which inhibits the growth
of pathogens blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell membranes and the process of urination which
flushes pathogens from the urinary tract
Despite these barriers pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures or by collecting on
mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the mucus or cilia Some pathogens have evolved specific
mechanisms that allow them to overcome physical and chemical barriers When pathogens do enter the body
the innate immune system responds with inflammation pathogen engulfment and secretion of immune factors
and proteins
Pathogen Recognition
An infection may be intracellular or extracellular depending on the pathogen All viruses infect cells and
replicate within those cells intracellularly whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate intracellularly or
extracellularly depending on the species The innate immune system must respond accordingly by identifying
the extracellular pathogen andor by identifying host cells that have already been infected When a pathogen
enters the body cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogenassociated molecular patterns
PAMPs on the pathogens surface PAMPs are carbohydrate polypeptide and nucleic acid signatures
that are expressed by viruses bacteria and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells The
immune system has specific cells described in Figure 422 and shown in Figure 423 with receptors that
recognize these PAMPs A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens
Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors PRRs PRRs are
molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment A monocyte
is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after
it moves into infected tissue Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen
engulfment and destruction Tolllike receptors TLRs are a type of PRR that recognizes molecules that are
shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules TLRs are present in invertebrates as well as
vertebrates and appear to be one of the most ancient components of the immune system TLRs have also been
identified in the mammalian nervous system
