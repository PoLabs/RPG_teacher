6 Why are steroids able to diffuse across the plasma
membrane
a
Their transport protein moves them through
the membrane
b
They are amphipathic allowing them to
interact with the entire phospholipid
c
Cells express channels that let hormones
flow down their concentration gradient into
the cells
d
They are nonpolar molecules
7 A new antagonist molecule has been discovered
that binds to and blocks plasma membrane
receptors What effect will this antagonist have on
testosterone a steroid hormone
a
It will block testosterone from binding to its
receptor
b
It will block testosterone from activating
cAMP signaling
c
It will increase testosteronemediated
signaling
d
It will not affect testosteronemediated
signaling
8 What effect will a cAMP inhibitor have on a peptide
hormonemediated signaling pathway
a
It will prevent the hormone from binding its
receptor
b
It will prevent activation of a Gprotein
c
It will prevent activation of adenylate
cyclase
d
It will prevent activation of protein kinases
9 When insulin binds to its receptor the complex is
endocytosed into the cell This is an example of

receptor downregulation
10 Drinking alcoholic beverages causes an increase
in urine output This most likely occurs because

female
b
Patients would appear phenotypically male

characteristics
c
Patients would appear phenotypically male
but cannot produce sperm
d
Patients would express both male and
female secondary sex characteristics
15 A rise in blood glucose levels triggers release of
insulin from the pancreas This mechanism of
hormone production is stimulated by
a
humoral stimuli
b
hormonal stimuli
c
neural stimuli
d
negative stimuli
16 Which mechanism of hormonal stimulation would
be affected if signaling and hormone release from the
hypothalamus was blocked
