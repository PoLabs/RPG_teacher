immune response T cells are able to recognize antigens credit modification of work by NCI scalebar data from Matt

T and B cells exhibit a common theme of recognitionbinding of specific antigens via a complementary receptor
followed by activation and selfamplificationmaturation to specifically bind to the particular antigen of the
infecting pathogen T and B lymphocytes are also similar in that each cell only expresses one type of antigen
receptor Any individual may possess a population of T and B cells that together express a near limitless variety
of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing virtually any infecting pathogen T and B cells are activated
when they recognize small components of antigens called epitopes presented by APCs illustrated in Figure
4210 Note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire antigen for this reason
epitopes are known as antigenic determinants In the absence of information from APCs T and B cells remain
inactive or nave and are unable to prepare an immune response The requirement for information from the
APCs of innate immunity to trigger B cell or T cell activation illustrates the essential nature of the innate immune
response to the functioning of the entire immune system
Figure 4210 An antigen is a macromolecule that reacts with components of the immune system A given antigen may
contain several motifs that are recognized by immune cells Each motif is an epitope In this figure the entire structure
is an antigen and the orange salmon and green components projecting from it represent potential epitopes
Nave T cells can express one of two different molecules CD4 or CD8 on their surface as shown in Figure
4211 and are accordingly classified as CD4 or CD8 cells These molecules are important because they
regulate how a T cell will interact with and respond to an APC Nave CD4 cells bind APCs via their antigen
embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T TH lymphocytes cells that go on to
stimulate B cells or cytotoxic T cells directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about
the pathogenic threat In contrast CD8 cells engage antigenembedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are
stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTLs which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit
cytokines to amplify the immune response The two populations of T cells have different mechanisms of immune
protection but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell receptors TCRs The CD4 or
CD8 surface molecules differentiate whether the TCR will engage an MHC II or an MHC I molecule Because
they assist in binding specificity the CD4 and CD8 molecules are described as coreceptors
