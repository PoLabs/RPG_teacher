transport of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the waters concentration
gradient across the membrane that results from the presence of solute that cannot pass through the
membrane
method of transporting material through a membrane that does not require energy
protein at the plasma membranes surface either on its exterior or interior side
a variation of endocytosis that imports macromolecules that the cell needs from the extracellular
fluid
detaching the cell membrane from the cell wall and constricting the cell membrane when a plant
cell is in a hypertonic solution
variation of pinocytosis that uses a different coating protein caveolin on the plasma membranes
cytoplasmic side
active transport that moves ions or small molecules across a membrane and may
create a difference in charge across that membrane
active transport mechanism that works against electrochemical gradients
variation of endocytosis that involves using specific binding proteins in the
plasma membrane for specific molecules or particles and clathrincoated pits that become clathrincoated
vesicles

membrane characteristic that allows some substances through
substance dissolved in a liquid to form a solution
transporter that carries two different ions or small molecules both in the same direction
amount of solute in a solution
membrane protein that facilitates a substances passage across a membrane by binding it
specific carrier proteins or pumps that facilitate movement
transporter that carries one specific ion or molecule
CHAPTER SUMMARY
51 Components and Structure
Modern scientists refer to the plasma membrane as the fluid mosaic model A phospholipid bilayer comprises
the plasma membrane with hydrophobic fatty acid tails in contact with each other The membranes landscape
is studded with proteins some which span the membrane Some of these proteins serve to transport materials
into or out of the cell Carbohydrates are attached to some of the proteins and lipids on the membranes
outwardfacing surface forming complexes that function to identify the cell to other cells The membranes fluid
nature is due to temperature fatty acid tail configuration some kinked by double bonds cholesterol presence
embedded in the membrane and the mosaic nature of the proteins and proteincarbohydrate combinations
which are not firmly fixed in place Plasma membranes enclose and define the cells borders Not static they
are dynamic and constantly in flux
52 Passive Transport
The passive transport forms diffusion and osmosis move materials of small molecular weight across
membranes Substances diffuse from high to lower concentration areas and this process continues until the
substance evenly distributes itself in a system In solutions containing more than one substance each molecule
