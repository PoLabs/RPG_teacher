352  How Neurons Communicate
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the basis of the resting membrane potential

Explain the stages of an action potential and how action potentials are propagated

Explain the similarities and differences between chemical and electrical synapses

Describe longterm potentiation and longterm depression
All functions performed by the nervous systemfrom a simple motor reflex to more advanced functions like
making a memory or a decisionrequire neurons to communicate with one another While humans use words
and body language to communicate neurons use electrical and chemical signals Just like a person in a
committee one neuron usually receives and synthesizes messages from multiple other neurons before making
the decision to send the message on to other neurons
Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron
For the nervous system to function neurons must be able to send and receive signals These signals are
possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane a voltage difference between the inside
and the outside and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules
released from other neurons and environmental stimuli To understand how neurons communicate one must
first understand the basis of the baseline or resting membrane charge
Neuronal Charged Membranes
The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions To enter
or exit the neuron ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane
Ion channels have different configurations open closed and inactive as illustrated in Figure 359 Some
ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell These ion
channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly Ion channels that change
their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltagegated ion channels Voltagegated ion channels
regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell The difference in total charge
between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential
