CHAPTER SUMMARY
321 Reproductive Development and Structure
The flower contains the reproductive structures of a plant All complete flowers contain four whorls the calyx
corolla androecium and gynoecium The stamens are made up of anthers in which pollen grains are
produced and a supportive strand called the filament The pollen contains two cells a generative cell and a
tube celland is covered by two layers called the intine and the exine The carpels which are the female
reproductive structures consist of the stigma style and ovary The female gametophyte is formed from mitotic
divisions of the megaspore forming an eightnuclei ovule sac This is covered by a layer known as the
integument The integument contains an opening called the micropyle through which the pollen tube enters the
embryo sac
The diploid sporophyte of angiosperms and gymnosperms is the conspicuous and longlived stage of the life
cycle The sporophytes differentiate specialized reproductive structures called sporangia which are dedicated
to the production of spores The microsporangium contains microspore mother cells which divide by meiosis to
produce haploid microspores The microspores develop into male gametophytes that are released as pollen
The megasporangium contains megaspore mother cells which divide by meiosis to produce haploid
megaspores A megaspore develops into a female gametophyte containing a haploid egg A new diploid
sporophyte is formed when a male gamete from a pollen grain enters the ovule sac and fertilizes this egg
322 Pollination and Fertilization
For fertilization to occur in angiosperms pollen has to be transferred to the stigma of a flower a process known
as pollination Gymnosperm pollination involves the transfer of pollen from a male cone to a female cone
When the pollen of the flower is transferred to the stigma of the same flower it is called selfpollination Cross
pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from one flower to another flower on the same plant or another
plant Crosspollination requires pollinating agents such as water wind or animals and increases genetic
diversity After the pollen lands on the stigma the tube cell gives rise to the pollen tube through which the
generative nucleus migrates The pollen tube gains entry through the micropyle on the ovule sac The
generative cell divides to form two sperm cells one fuses with the egg to form the diploid zygote and the other
fuses with the polar nuclei to form the endosperm which is triploid in nature This is known as double
fertilization After fertilization the zygote divides to form the embryo and the fertilized ovule forms the seed The
walls of the ovary form the fruit in which the seeds develop The seed when mature will germinate under
favorable conditions and give rise to the diploid sporophyte
323 Asexual Reproduction
Many plants reproduce asexually as well as sexually In asexual reproduction part of the parent plant is used to
generate a new plant Grafting layering and micropropagation are some methods used for artificial asexual
reproduction The new plant is genetically identical to the parent plant from which the stock has been taken
Asexually reproducing plants thrive well in stable environments
Plants have different life spans dependent on species genotype and environmental conditions Parts of the
plant such as regions containing meristematic tissue continue to grow while other parts experience
programmed cell death Leaves that are no longer photosynthetically active are shed from the plant as part of
senescence and the nutrients from these leaves are recycled by the plant Other factors including the
presence of hormones are known to play a role in delaying senescence
VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS
1 Figure 323 If the anther is missing what type of
reproductive structure will the flower be unable to
produce What term is used to describe a flower that
is normally lacking the androecium What term
describes a flower lacking a gynoecium
2 Figure 328 An embryo sac is missing the
synergids What specific impact would you expect
this to have on fertilization
a
The pollen tube will be unable to form
b
The pollen tube will form but will not be
guided toward the egg
c
Fertilization will not occur because the
synergid is the egg
d
Fertilization will occur but the embryo will
not be able to grow
