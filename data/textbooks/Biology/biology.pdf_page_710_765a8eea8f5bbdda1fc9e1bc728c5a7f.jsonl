a
Human consumption of fungal insecticides
would not make a person sick but ingestion
of chemical pesticides can be harmful to
humans
b
A single fungal insecticide would kill a wider
variety of insects than a chemical pesticide
c
Fungal insecticides can eliminate both
harmful insects and plant pathogens while
chemical pesticides only kill insects
d
Fungal insecticides will decompose dying
plants enhancing the nitrogen content of
the soil while chemical pesticides are not
decomposers
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
23 What are the evolutionary advantages for an
organism to reproduce both asexually and sexually
24 Compare plants animals and fungi considering
these components cell wall chloroplasts plasma
membrane food source and polysaccharide storage
Be sure to indicate fungis similarities and differences
to plants and animals
25 Why is the large surface area of the mycelium
essential for nutrient acquisition by fungi
26 What is the advantage for a basidiomycete to
produce a showy and fleshy fruiting body
27 For each of the four groups of perfect fungi
Chytridiomycota Zygomycota Ascomycota and
Basidiomycota compare the body structure and
features and provide an example
28 Why does protection from light actually benefit
the photosynthetic partner in lichens
29 Ambrosia bark beetles carry Ambrosiella fungal
spores to trees then bore holes and lay their eggs
with the fungus When the new larvae hatch they eat
the fungus that has germinated in the holes Describe
how this relationship can be classified as mutualistic
30 Ecologists often attempt to introduce new plants
to restore degraded land In an arid climate
scientists recommend introducing plants with
arbuscular mycorrhizae How would the mycorrhizae
increase the plants survival compared to plants
without mycorrhizae
31 Why can superficial mycoses in humans lead to
bacterial infections
32 Explain how the Red Queen Hypothesis
describes the continuously evolving relationship
between red grapes and Botrytis cinerea
33 Historically artisanal breads were produced by
capturing wild yeasts from the air Prior to the
development of modern yeast strains the production
of artisanal breads was long and laborious because
many batches of dough ended up being discarded
Can you explain this fact
34 How would treating an area of a forest with a
broadspectrum fungicide alter the carbon and
nitrogen cycles in the area
