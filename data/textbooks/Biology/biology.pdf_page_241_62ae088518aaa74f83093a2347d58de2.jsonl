The Two Parts of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages the lightdependent reactions and the lightindependent
reactions In the lightdependent reactions energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy
is converted into stored chemical energy In the lightindependent reactions the chemical energy harvested
during the lightdependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide Therefore
although the lightindependent reactions do not use light as a reactant they require the products of the light
dependent reactions to function In addition however several enzymes of the lightindependent reactions are
activated by light The lightdependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily store the energy These
are referred to as energy carriers The energy carriers that move energy from lightdependent reactions to light
independent reactions can be thought of as full because they are rich in energy After the energy is released
the empty energy carriers return to the lightdependent reaction to obtain more energy Figure 87 illustrates
the components inside the chloroplast where the lightdependent and lightindependent reactions take place
Figure 87 Photosynthesis takes place in two stages lightdependent reactions and the Calvin cycle Lightdependent
reactions which take place in the thylakoid membrane use light energy to make ATP and NADPH The Calvin cycle
which takes place in the stroma uses energy derived from these compounds to make GA3P from CO2
