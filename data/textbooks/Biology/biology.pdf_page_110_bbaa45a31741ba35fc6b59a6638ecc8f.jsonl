ribosomes on which the mRNA binds The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the Ribosomes
The ribosomes rRNA also has an enzymatic activity peptidyl transferase and catalyzes peptide bond formation
between two aligned amino acids Transfer RNA tRNA is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA usually
7090 nucleotides long It carries the correct amino acid to the protein synthesis site It is the base pairing
between the tRNA and mRNA that allows for the correct amino acid to insert itself in the polypeptide chain
MicroRNAs are the smallest RNA molecules and their role involves regulating gene expression by interfering
with the expression of certain mRNA messages Table 32 summarizes DNA and RNA features

Even though the RNA is single stranded most RNA types show extensive intramolecular base pairing between
complementary sequences creating a predictable threedimensional structure essential for their function
As you have learned information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein DNA dictates
the structure of mRNA in a process scientists call transcription and RNA dictates the proteins structure in
a process scientists call translation This is the Central Dogma of Life which holds true for all organisms
however exceptions to the rule occur in connection with viral infections
