the solar energy of the sun by converting it to chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADP The energy
stored in ATP is used to synthesize complex organic molecules such as glucose
Chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available
such as in those associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean Figure 469
Many chemoautotrophs in hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide H2S which is released from the vents as
a source of chemical energy This allows chemoautotrophs to synthesize complex organic molecules such as
glucose for their own energy and in turn supplies energy to the rest of the ecosystem
Figure 469 Swimming shrimp a few squat lobsters and hundreds of vent mussels are seen at a hydrothermal vent
at the bottom of the ocean As no sunlight penetrates to this depth the ecosystem is supported by chemoautotrophic
bacteria and organic material that sinks from the oceans surface This picture was taken in 2006 at the submerged NW
Eifuku volcano off the coast of Japan by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA The summit of
this highly active volcano lies 1535 m below the surface
Productivity within Trophic Levels
Productivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem
incorporated into biomass in a particular trophic level Biomass is the total mass in a unit area at the time
of measurement of living or previously living organisms within a trophic level Ecosystems have characteristic
amounts of biomass at each trophic level For example in the English Channel ecosystem the primary producers
account for a biomass of 4 gm2 grams per square meter while the primary consumers exhibit a biomass of 21
gm2
The productivity of the primary producers is especially important in any ecosystem because these organisms
bring energy to other living organisms by photoautotrophy or chemoautotrophy The rate at which photosynthetic
primary producers incorporate energy from the sun is called gross primary productivity An example of gross
primary productivity is shown in the compartment diagram of energy flow within the Silver Springs aquatic
ecosystem as shown Figure 468 In this ecosystem the total energy accumulated by the primary producers
gross primary productivity was shown to be 20810 kcalm2yr
Because all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions like respiration and resulting
metabolic heat loss scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem Net primary
productivity is the energy that remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organisms respiration
and heat loss The net productivity is then available to the primary consumers at the next trophic level In our
Silver Springs example 13187 of the 20810 kcalm2yr were used for respiration or were lost as heat leaving
7633 kcalm2yr of energy for use by the primary consumers
Ecological Efficiency The Transfer of Energy between Trophic Levels
As illustrated in Figure 468 as energy flows from primary producers through the various trophic levels the
ecosystem loses large amounts of energy The main reason for this loss is the second law of thermodynamics
