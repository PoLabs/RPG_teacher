363  Taste and Smell
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain in what way smell and taste stimuli differ from other sensory stimuli

Identify the five primary tastes that can be distinguished by humans

Explain in anatomical terms why a dogs sense of smell is more acute than a humans
Taste also called gustation and smell also called olfaction are the most interconnected senses in that both
involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors Smell lets an animal sense the
presence of food or other animalswhether potential mates predators or preyor other chemicals in the
environment that can impact their survival Similarly the sense of taste allows animals to discriminate between
types of foods While the value of a sense of smell is obvious what is the value of a sense of taste Different
tasting foods have different attributes both helpful and harmful For example sweettasting substances tend to
be highly caloric which could be necessary for survival in lean times Bitterness is associated with toxicity and
sourness is associated with spoiled food Salty foods are valuable in maintaining homeostasis by helping the
body retain water and by providing ions necessary for cells to function
Tastes and Odors
Both taste and odor stimuli are molecules taken in from the environment The primary tastes detected by humans
are sweet sour bitter salty and umami The first four tastes need little explanation The identification of umami
as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recentlyit was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda
while he worked with seaweed broth but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically
distinguished until many years later The taste of umami also known as savoriness is attributable to the taste
of the amino acid Lglutamate In fact monosodium glutamate or MSG is often used in cooking to enhance the
savory taste of certain foods What is the adaptive value of being able to distinguish umami Savory substances
tend to be high in protein
All odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe If a substance does not release molecules
into the air from its surface it has no smell And if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that
recognizes a specific molecule then that molecule has no smell Humans have about 350 olfactory receptor
subtypes that work in various combinations to allow us to sense about 10000 different odors Compare that to
mice for example which have about 1300 olfactory receptor types and therefore probably sense more odors
Both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specific chemoreceptors Although humans commonly
distinguish taste as one sense and smell as another they work together to create the perception of flavor A
persons perception of flavor is reduced if he or she has congested nasal passages
Reception and Transduction
Odorants odor molecules enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium the mucosa at the back of
the nasal cavity as illustrated in Figure 368 The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory
receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans Recall that sensory cells
are neurons An olfactory receptor which is a dendrite of a specialized neuron responds when it binds certain
molecules inhaled from the environment by sending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain Humans
have about 12 million olfactory receptors distributed among hundreds of different receptor types that respond to
different odors Twelve million seems like a large number of receptors but compare that to other animals rabbits
have about 100 million most dogs have about 1 billion and bloodhoundsdogs selectively bred for their sense
of smellhave about 4 billion The overall size of the olfactory epithelium also differs between species with that
of bloodhounds for example being many times larger than that of humans
Olfactory neurons are bipolar neurons neurons with two processes from the cell body Each neuron has a
single dendrite buried in the olfactory epithelium and extending from this dendrite are 5 to 20 receptorladen
hairlike cilia that trap odorant molecules The sensory receptors on the cilia are proteins and it is the variations
in their amino acid chains that make the receptors sensitive to different odorants Each olfactory sensory neuron
has only one type of receptor on its cilia and the receptors are specialized to detect specific odorants so
the bipolar neurons themselves are specialized When an odorant binds with a receptor that recognizes it the
