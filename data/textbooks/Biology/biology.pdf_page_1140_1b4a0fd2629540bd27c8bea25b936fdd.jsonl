ascending projections to the pons thalamus and cerebellum Connections to the cerebellum are important
for coordinated movements There are also projections to the temporal cortex which account for feelings of
dizziness projections to autonomic nervous system areas in the brainstem which account for motion sickness
and projections to the primary somatosensory cortex which monitors subjective measurements of the external
world and selfmovement People with lesions in the vestibular area of the somatosensory cortex see vertical
objects in the world as being tilted Finally the vestibular signals project to certain optic muscles to coordinate
eye and head movements

365  Vision
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how electromagnetic waves differ from sound waves

Trace the path of light through the eye to the point of the optic nerve

Explain tonic activity as it is manifested in photoreceptors in the retina
Vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images Animals
are bombarded with sensory information and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic
Fortunately the visual systems of species have evolved to attend to the mostimportant stimuli The importance
of vision to humans is further substantiated by the fact that about onethird of the human cerebral cortex is
dedicated to analyzing and perceiving visual information
Light
As with auditory stimuli light travels in waves The compression waves that compose sound must travel in a
mediuma gas a liquid or a solid In contrast light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs no
medium light can travel in a vacuum Figure 3617 The behavior of light can be discussed in terms of the
behavior of waves and also in terms of the behavior of the fundamental unit of lighta packet of electromagnetic
radiation called a photon A glance at the electromagnetic spectrum shows that visible light for humans is just a
small slice of the entire spectrum which includes radiation that we cannot see as light because it is below the
frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible violet light
Certain variables are important when discussing perception of light Wavelength which varies inversely with
frequency manifests itself as hue Light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths and is
lower frequency while light at the violet end has shorter wavelengths and is higher frequency The wavelength
of light is expressed in nanometers nm one nanometer is one billionth of a meter Humans perceive light
that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740 nm Some other animals though can detect wavelengths
outside of the human range For example bees see nearultraviolet light in order to locate nectar guides on
flowers and some nonavian reptiles sense infrared light heat that prey gives off
