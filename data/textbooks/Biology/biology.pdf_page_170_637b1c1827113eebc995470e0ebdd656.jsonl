subjects die Why do you think a potassium solution injection is lethal
Moving Against a Gradient
To move substances against a concentration or electrochemical gradient the cell must use energy This
energy comes from ATP generated through the cells metabolism Active transport mechanisms or pumps
work against electrochemical gradients Small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes Active
transport maintains concentrations of ions and other substances that living cells require in the face of these
passive movements A cell may spend much of its metabolic energy supply maintaining these processes A red
blood cell uses most of its metabolic energy to maintain the imbalance between exterior and interior sodium and
potassium levels that the cell requires Because active transport mechanisms depend on a cells metabolism for
energy they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the ATP supply
Two mechanisms exist for transporting smallmolecular weight material and small molecules Primary active
transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane which
is directly dependent on ATP Secondary active transport does not directly require ATP instead it is the
movement of material due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport
Carrier Proteins for Active Transport
An important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps
to facilitate movement there are three protein types or transporters Figure 517 A uniporter carries one
specific ion or molecule A symporter carries two different ions or molecules both in the same direction An
antiporter also carries two different ions or molecules but in different directions All of these transporters can
also transport small uncharged organic molecules like glucose These three types of carrier proteins are also
in facilitated diffusion but they do not require ATP to work in that process Some examples of pumps for active
transport are NaK ATPase which carries sodium and potassium ions and HK ATPase which carries
