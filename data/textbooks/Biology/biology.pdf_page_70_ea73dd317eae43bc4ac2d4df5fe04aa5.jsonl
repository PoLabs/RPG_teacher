linear fatty acids that are able to pack tightly together at room temperature and form solid fats In the human diet
trans fats are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease so many food manufacturers have reduced
or eliminated their use in recent years In contrast to unsaturated fats we call triglycerides without double bonds
between carbon atoms saturated fats meaning that they contain all the hydrogen atoms available Saturated
fats are a solid at room temperature and usually of animal origin
Figure 225 These spacefilling models show a cis oleic acid and a trans eliadic acid fatty acid Notice the bend in
the molecule caused by the cis configuration
Enantiomers
Enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three
dimensional placement of atoms so that they are nonsuperimposable mirror images Figure 226 shows an
amino acid alanine example where the two structures are nonsuperimposable In nature only the Lforms of
amino acids make proteins Some D forms of amino acids are seen in the cell walls of bacteria but never in their
proteins Similarly the Dform of glucose is the main product of photosynthesis and we rarely see the molecules
Lform in nature
Figure 226 Dalanine and Lalanine are examples of enantiomers or mirror images Only the Lforms of amino acids
are used to make proteins
Functional Groups
Functional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to
those molecules We find them along the carbon backbone of macromolecules Chains andor rings of carbon
atoms with the occasional substitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen form this carbon backbone
Molecules with other elements in their carbon backbone are substituted hydrocarbons
The functional groups in a macromolecule are usually attached to the carbon backbone at one or several
different places along its chain andor ring structure Each of the four types of macromoleculesproteins lipids
carbohydrates and nucleic acidshas its own characteristic set of functional groups that contributes greatly to
