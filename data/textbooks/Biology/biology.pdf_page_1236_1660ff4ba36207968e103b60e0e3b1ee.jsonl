Tracheal Systems
Insect respiration is independent of its circulatory system therefore the blood does not play a direct role in
oxygen transport Insects have a highly specialized type of respiratory system called the tracheal system which
consists of a network of small tubes that carries oxygen to the entire body The tracheal system is the most direct
and efficient respiratory system in active animals The tubes in the tracheal system are made of a polymeric
material called chitin
Insect bodies have openings called spiracles along the thorax and abdomen These openings connect to the
tubular network allowing oxygen to pass into the body Figure 396 and regulating the diffusion of CO2 and
water vapor Air enters and leaves the tracheal system through the spiracles Some insects can ventilate the
tracheal system with body movements
Figure 396 Insects perform respiration via a tracheal system
Mammalian Systems
In mammals pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation breathing During inhalation air enters the body
through the nasal cavity located just inside the nose Figure 397 As air passes through the nasal cavity the
air is warmed to body temperature and humidified The respiratory tract is coated with mucus to seal the tissues
from direct contact with air Mucus is high in water As air crosses these surfaces of the mucous membranes
it picks up water These processes help equilibrate the air to the body conditions reducing any damage that
cold dry air can cause Particulate matter that is floating in the air is removed in the nasal passages via mucus
and cilia The processes of warming humidifying and removing particles are important protective mechanisms
that prevent damage to the trachea and lungs Thus inhalation serves several purposes in addition to bringing
oxygen into the respiratory system
