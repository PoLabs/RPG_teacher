Dialysis Technician
Dialysis is a medical process of removing wastes and excess water from the blood by diffusion and
ultrafiltration When kidney function fails dialysis must be done to artificially rid the body of wastes This is
a vital process to keep patients alive In some cases the patients undergo artificial dialysis until they are
eligible for a kidney transplant In others who are not candidates for kidney transplants dialysis is a lifelong
necessity
Dialysis technicians typically work in hospitals and clinics While some roles in this field include equipment
development and maintenance most dialysis technicians work in direct patient care Their onthejob
duties which typically occur under the direct supervision of a registered nurse focus on providing dialysis
treatments This can include reviewing patient history and current condition assessing and responding to
patient needs before and during treatment and monitoring the dialysis process Treatment may include
taking and reporting a patients vital signs and preparing solutions and equipment to ensure accurate and
sterile procedures
412  The Kidneys and Osmoregulatory Organs
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how the kidneys serve as the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems

Describe the structure of the kidneys and the functions of the parts of the kidney

Describe how the nephron is the functional unit of the kidney and explain how it actively filters blood and
generates urine

Detail the three steps in the formation of urine glomerular filtration tubular reabsorption and tubular
secretion
Although the kidneys are the major osmoregulatory organ the skin and lungs also play a role in the process
Water and electrolytes are lost through sweat glands in the skin which helps moisturize and cool the skin
surface while the lungs expel a small amount of water in the form of mucous secretions and via evaporation of
water vapor
Kidneys The Main Osmoregulatory Organ
The kidneys illustrated in Figure 414 are a pair of beanshaped structures that are located just below and
posterior to the liver in the peritoneal cavity The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the
suprarenal glands Kidneys filter blood and purify it All the blood in the human body is filtered many times a day
by the kidneys these organs use up almost 25 percent of the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to perform this
function Oxygen allows the kidney cells to efficiently manufacture chemical energy in the form of ATP through
aerobic respiration The filtrate coming out of the kidneys is called urine
