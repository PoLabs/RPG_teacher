Figure 352 Nervous systems vary in structure and complexity In a cnidarians nerve cells form a decentralized nerve
net In b echinoderms nerve cells are bundled into fibers called nerves In animals exhibiting bilateral symmetry
such as c planarians neurons cluster into an anterior brain that processes information In addition to a brain d
arthropods have clusters of nerve cell bodies called peripheral ganglia located along the ventral nerve cord Mollusks
such as squid and e octopi which must hunt to survive have complex brains containing millions of neurons In f
vertebrates the brain and spinal cord comprise the central nervous system while neurons extending into the rest of
the body comprise the peripheral nervous system credit e modification of work by Michael Vecchione Clyde FE

Compared to invertebrates vertebrate nervous systems are more complex centralized and specialized While
there is great diversity among different vertebrate nervous systems they all share a basic structure a CNS that
contains a brain and spinal cord and a PNS made up of peripheral sensory and motor nerves One interesting
difference between the nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates is that the nerve cords of many
invertebrates are located ventrally whereas the vertebrate spinal cords are located dorsally There is debate
among evolutionary biologists as to whether these different nervous system plans evolved separately or whether
the invertebrate body plan arrangement somehow flipped during the evolution of vertebrates
