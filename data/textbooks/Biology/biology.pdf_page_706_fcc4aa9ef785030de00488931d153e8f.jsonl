KEY TERMS
mycorrhizal association in which the fungal hyphae enter the root cells and form
extensive networks
mycorrhizae commonly involving Glomeromycetes in which the fungal hyphae
penetrate the cell walls of the plant root cells but not the cell membranes
fruiting body of ascomycetes
also sac fungi phylum of fungi that store spores in a sac called ascus
fruiting body that protrudes from the ground and bears the basidia
also club fungi phylum of fungi that produce clubshaped structures basidia that contain
spores
clubshaped fruiting body of basidiomycetes
also chytrids primitive phylum of fungi that live in water and produce gametes with flagella
single hypha that lacks septa and contains many nuclei
symbiotic relationship in which one member benefits while the other member is not affected
former form phylum of fungi that do not have a known sexual reproductive cycle presently
members of two phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota
mycorrhizal fungi that surround the roots with a mantle and have a Hartig net that extends into
the roots between cells
mycorrhizae in which the fungal hyphae do not penetrate the root cells of the plant
organisms that can perform both aerobic and anaerobic respiration and can survive in
oxygenrich and oxygenpoor environment
phylum of fungi that form symbiotic relationships with the roots of trees
modified hyphae on many parasitic fungi that penetrate the tissues of their hosts release digestive
enzymes andor absorb nutrients from the host
describes when only one mating type is present in an individual mycelium
describes when both mating types are present in mycelium
fungal filament composed of one or more cells
fusion of nuclei
close association of a fungus with a photosynthetic alga or bacterium that benefits both partners
tangle of visible mycelia with a fuzzy appearance
mass of fungal hyphae
ingestion of toxins in poisonous mushrooms
scientific study of fungi
mutualistic association between fungi and vascular plant roots
a mutualistic relationship between a plant and a fungus Mycorrhizae are connections between
fungal hyphae which provide soil minerals to the plant and plant roots which provide carbohydrates to the
