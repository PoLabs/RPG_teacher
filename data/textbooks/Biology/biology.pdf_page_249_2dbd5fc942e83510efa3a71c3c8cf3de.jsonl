required to form one molecule of diatomic O2 gas About 10 percent of the oxygen is used by mitochondria in the
leaf to support oxidative phosphorylation The remainder escapes to the atmosphere where it is used by aerobic
organisms to support respiration
As electrons move through the proteins that reside between PSII and PSI they lose energy This energy is used
to move hydrogen atoms from the stromal side of the membrane to the thylakoid lumen Those hydrogen atoms
plus the ones produced by splitting water accumulate in the thylakoid lumen and will be used synthesize ATP
in a later step Because the electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at PSI they must be reenergized by
PSI hence another photon is absorbed by the PSI antenna That energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center
called P700 P700 is oxidized and sends a highenergy electron to NADP to form NADPH Thus PSII captures
the energy to create proton gradients to make ATP and PSI captures the energy to reduce NADP into NADPH
The two photosystems work in concert in part to guarantee that the production of NADPH will roughly equal the
production of ATP Other mechanisms exist to finetune that ratio to exactly match the chloroplasts constantly
changing energy needs
Generating an Energy Carrier ATP
As in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during cellular respiration the buildup of hydrogen ions
inside the thylakoid lumen creates a concentration gradient The passive diffusion of hydrogen ions from high
concentration in the thylakoid lumen to low concentration in the stroma is harnessed to create ATP just as in
the electron transport chain of cellular respiration The ions build up energy because of diffusion and because
they all have the same electrical charge repelling each other
To release this energy hydrogen ions will rush through any opening similar to water jetting through a hole in a
dam In the thylakoid that opening is a passage through a specialized protein channel called the ATP synthase
The energy released by the hydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate group to
ADP which forms a molecule of ATP Figure 816 The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called
chemiosmosis because the ions move from an area of high to an area of low concentration through a semi
permeable structure of the thylakoid

83  Using Light Energy to Make Organic Molecules
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the Calvin cycle

Define carbon fixation

Explain how photosynthesis works in the energy cycle of all living organisms
After the energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy and temporarily stored in ATP and NADPH
molecules the cell has the fuel needed to build carbohydrate molecules for longterm energy storage The
products of the lightdependent reactions ATP and NADPH have lifespans in the range of millionths of seconds
whereas the products of the lightindependent reactions carbohydrates and other forms of reduced carbon can
survive almost indefinitely The carbohydrate molecules made will have a backbone of carbon atoms But where
does the carbon come from It comes from carbon dioxidethe gas that is a waste product of respiration in
microbes fungi plants and animals
