can fit inside a eukaryotic nucleus
31 Briefly describe the events that occur in each
phase of interphase
32 Chemotherapy drugs such as vincristine derived
from Madagascar periwinkle plants and colchicine
derived from autumn crocus plants disrupt mitosis
by binding to tubulin the subunit of microtubules
and interfering with microtubule assembly and
disassembly Exactly what mitotic structure is
targeted by these drugs and what effect would that
have on cell division
33 Describe the similarities and differences between
the cytokinesis mechanisms found in animal cells
versus those in plant cells
34 List some reasons why a cell that has just
completed cytokinesis might enter the G0 phase
instead of the G1 phase
35 What cellcycle events will be affected in a cell
that produces mutated nonfunctional cohesin
protein
36 Describe the general conditions that must be met
at each of the three main cellcycle checkpoints
37 Compare and contrast the roles of the positive
cellcycle regulators negative regulators
38 What steps are necessary for Cdk to become
fully active
39 Rb is a negative regulator that blocks the cell
cycle at the G1 checkpoint until the cell achieves a
requisite size What molecular mechanism does Rb
employ to halt the cell cycle
40 Outline the steps that lead to a cell becoming
cancerous
41 Explain the difference between a protooncogene
and a tumorsuppressor gene
42 List the regulatory mechanisms that might be lost
in a cell producing faulty p53
43 p53 can trigger apoptosis if certain cellcycle
events fail How does this regulatory outcome benefit
a multicellular organism
44 Name the common components of eukaryotic cell
division and binary fission
45 Describe how the duplicated bacterial
chromosomes are distributed into new daughter cells
without the direction of the mitotic spindle
