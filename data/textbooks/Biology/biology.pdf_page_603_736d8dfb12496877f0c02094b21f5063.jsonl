Figure 225 Radiationtolerant prokaryotes Deinococcus radiodurans visualized in this false color transmission
electron micrograph is a prokaryote that can tolerate very high doses of ionizing radiation It has developed DNA repair
mechanisms that allow it to reconstruct its chromosome even if it has been broken into hundreds of pieces by radiation

Prokaryotes in the Dead Sea
One example of a very harsh environment is the Dead Sea a hypersaline basin that is located between Jordan
and Israel Hypersaline environments are essentially concentrated seawater In the Dead Sea the sodium
concentration is 10 times higher than that of seawater and the water contains high levels of magnesium about
40 times higher than in seawater that would be toxic to most living things Iron calcium and magnesium
elements that form divalent ions Fe2 Ca2 and Mg2 produce what is commonly referred to as hard water
Taken together the high concentration of divalent cations the acidic pH 60 and the intense solar radiation flux
make the Dead Sea a unique and uniquely hostile ecosystem

What sort of prokaryotes do we find in the Dead Sea The extremely salttolerant bacterial mats include
Halobacterium Haloferax volcanii which is found in other locations not only the Dead Sea Halorubrum
sodomense and Halobaculum gomorrense and the archaean Haloarcula marismortui among others

Unculturable Prokaryotes and the ViablebutNonCulturable State
The process of culturing bacteria is complex and is one of the greatest discoveries of modern science German
physician Robert Koch is credited with discovering the techniques for pure culture including staining and using
