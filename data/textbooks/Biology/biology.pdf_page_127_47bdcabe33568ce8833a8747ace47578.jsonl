The Nucleolus
We already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes but how does it do this Some
chromosomes have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA A darkly staining area within the nucleus
called the nucleolus plural  nucleoli aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the
ribosomal subunits that are then transported out through the pores in the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm
Ribosomes
Ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis When we view them through an electron
microscope ribosomes appear either as clusters polyribosomes or single tiny dots that float freely in the
cytoplasm They may be attached to the plasma membranes cytoplasmic side or the endoplasmic reticulums
cytoplasmic side and the nuclear envelopes outer membrane Figure 48 Electron microscopy shows us
that ribosomes which are large protein and RNA complexes consist of two subunits large and small Figure
413 Ribosomes receive their orders for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA transcribes
into messenger RNA mRNA The mRNA travels to the ribosomes which translate the code provided by the
sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids in a protein Amino acids
are the building blocks of proteins

ribosomes assemble amino acids into proteins
