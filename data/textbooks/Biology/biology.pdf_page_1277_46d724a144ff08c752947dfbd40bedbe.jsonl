Figure 4015 The major human arteries and veins are shown credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal
Arterioles diverge into capillary beds Capillary beds contain a large number 10 to 100 of capillaries that
branch among the cells and tissues of the body Capillaries are narrowdiameter tubes that can fit red blood
cells through in single file and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients waste and oxygen with tissues at the
cellular level Fluid also crosses into the interstitial space from the capillaries The capillaries converge again into
venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide
back to the heart Veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart The major veins drain blood from
the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply Fluid is also brought back to the heart via the lymphatic
system
The structure of the different types of blood vessels reflects their function or layers There are three distinct
layers or tunics that form the walls of blood vessels Figure 4016 The first tunic is a smooth inner lining
of endothelial cells that are in contact with the red blood cells The endothelial tunic is continuous with the
endocardium of the heart In capillaries this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon
dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and
exocytosis The movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by vasoconstriction narrowing of
the blood vessels and vasodilation widening of the blood vessels this is important in the overall regulation of
blood pressure
Veins and arteries both have two further tunics that surround the endothelium the middle tunic is composed of
smooth muscle and the outermost layer is connective tissue collagen and elastic fibers The elastic connective
tissue stretches and supports the blood vessels and the smooth muscle layer helps regulate blood flow by
altering vascular resistance through vasoconstriction and vasodilation The arteries have thicker smooth muscle
and connective tissue than the veins to accommodate the higher pressure and speed of freshly pumped blood
The veins are thinner walled as the pressure and rate of flow are much lower In addition veins are structurally
different than arteries in that veins have valves to prevent the backflow of blood Because veins have to work
against gravity to get blood back to the heart contraction of skeletal muscle assists with the flow of blood back
to the heart
