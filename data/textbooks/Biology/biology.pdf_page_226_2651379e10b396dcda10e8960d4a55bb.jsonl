Figure 714 Lactic acid fermentation is common in muscle cells that have run out of oxygen
Tremetol a metabolic poison found in the white snakeroot plant prevents the metabolism of lactate When
cows eat this plant tremetol is concentrated in the milk they produce Humans who consume the milk
can become seriously ill Symptoms of this disease which include vomiting abdominal pain and tremors
become worse after exercise Why do you think this is the case
Alcohol Fermentation
Another familiar fermentation process is alcohol fermentation Figure 715 which produces ethanol The first
chemical reaction of alcohol fermentation is the following CO2 does not participate in the second reaction
pyruvic acid  H CO2  acetaldehyde  NADH  H ethanol  NAD
The first reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase a cytoplasmic enzyme with a coenzyme of thiamine
pyrophosphate TPP derived from vitamin B1 and also called thiamine A carboxyl group is removed from
pyruvic acid releasing carbon dioxide as a gas The loss of carbon dioxide reduces the size of the molecule
by one carbon producing acetaldehyde The second reaction is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase to oxidize
NADH to NAD and reduce acetaldehyde to ethanol The fermentation of pyruvic acid by yeast produces the
ethanol found in alcoholic beverages Ethanol tolerance of yeast is variable ranging from about 5 percent to 21
percent depending on the yeast strain and environmental conditions
