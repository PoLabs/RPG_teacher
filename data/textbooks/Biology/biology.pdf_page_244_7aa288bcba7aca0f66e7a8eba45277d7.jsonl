Figure 811 The sun emits energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation This radiation exists at different
wavelengths each of which has its own characteristic energy All electromagnetic radiation including visible light is
characterized by its wavelength
Each type of electromagnetic radiation travels at a particular wavelength The longer the wavelength the less
energy it carries Short tight waves carry the most energy This may seem illogical but think of it in terms of a
piece of moving heavy rope It takes little effort by a person to move a rope in long wide waves To make a rope
move in short tight waves a person would need to apply significantly more energy
The electromagnetic spectrum Figure 811 shows several types of electromagnetic radiation originating from
the sun including Xrays and ultraviolet UV rays The higherenergy waves can penetrate tissues and damage
cells and DNA which explains why both Xrays and UV rays can be harmful to living organisms
Absorption of Light
Light energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb specific wavelengths of visible light
Organic pigments whether in the human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid have a narrow range of energy
levels that they can absorb Energy levels lower than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an
orbital electron to a excited quantum state Energy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear
the molecules apart in a process called bleaching Our retinal pigments can only see absorb wavelengths
between 700 nm and 400 nm of light a spectrum that is therefore called visible light For the same reasons
plants pigment molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm plant physiologists
refer to this range for plants as photosynthetically active radiation
The visible light seen by humans as white light actually exists in a rainbow of colors Certain objects such as
a prism or a drop of water disperse white light to reveal the colors to the human eye The visible light portion
of the electromagnetic spectrum shows the rainbow of colors with violet and blue having shorter wavelengths
and therefore higher energy At the other end of the spectrum toward red the wavelengths are longer and have
lower energy Figure 812
