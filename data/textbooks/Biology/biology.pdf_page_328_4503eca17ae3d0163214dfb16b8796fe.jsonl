Sexual reproduction was likely an early evolutionary innovation after the appearance of eukaryotic cells It
appears to have been very successful because most eukaryotes are able to reproduce sexually and in many
animals it is the only mode of reproduction And yet scientists also recognize some real disadvantages to
sexual reproduction On the surface creating offspring that are genetic clones of the parent appears to be a
better system If the parent organism is successfully occupying a habitat offspring with the same traits should
be similarly successful There is also the obvious benefit to an organism that can produce offspring whenever
circumstances are favorable by asexual budding fragmentation or by producing eggs asexually These methods
of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite sex Indeed some organisms that lead a solitary
lifestyle have retained the ability to reproduce asexually In addition in asexual populations every individual
is capable of reproduction In sexual populations the males are not producing the offspring themselves so
hypothetically an asexual population could grow twice as fast
However multicellular organisms that exclusively depend on asexual reproduction are exceedingly rare Why
are meiosis and sexual reproductive strategies so common These are important and as yet unanswered
questions in biology even though they have been the focus of much research beginning in the latter half of the
20th century There are several possible explanations one of which is that the variation that sexual reproduction
creates among offspring is very important to the survival and reproduction of the population Thus on average
a sexually reproducing population will leave more descendants than an otherwise similar asexually reproducing
population The only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation Mutations that take place during the
formation of germ cell lines are also the ultimate source of variation in sexually reproducing organisms However
in contrast to mutation during asexual reproduction the mutations during sexual reproduction can be continually
reshuffled from one generation to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes
are mixed into different combinations by crossovers during prophase I and random assortment at metaphase I
The Red Queen Hypothesis
Genetic variation is the outcome of sexual reproduction but why are ongoing variations necessary even
under seemingly stable environmental conditions Enter the Red Queen hypothesis first proposed by Leigh
Van Valen in 1973

The concept was named in reference to the Red Queens race in Lewis Carrolls book
Through the LookingGlass
All species coevolve evolve together with other organisms For example predators evolve with their prey
and parasites evolve with their hosts Each tiny advantage gained by favorable variation gives a species
a reproductive edge over close competitors predators parasites or even prey However survival of any
given genotype or phenotype in a population is dependent on the reproductive fitness of other genotypes
or phenotypes within a given species The only method that will allow a coevolving species to maintain
its own share of the resources is to also continually improve its fitness the capacity of the members to
produce more reproductively viable offspring relative to others within a species As one species gains an
advantage this increases selection on the other species they must also develop an advantage or they will
be outcompeted No single species progresses too far ahead because genetic variation among the progeny
of sexual reproduction provides all species with a mechanism to improve rapidly Species that cannot keep
up become extinct The Red Queens catchphrase was It takes all the running you can do to stay in the
same place This is an apt description of coevolution between competing species
Life Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms
Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles What happens between these two events depends
on the organisms reproductive strategy The process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half
Fertilization the joining of two haploid gametes restores the diploid condition Some organisms have a
multicellular diploid stage that is most obvious and only produce haploid reproductive cells Animals including
humans have this type of life cycle Other organisms such as fungi have a multicellular haploid stage that is
most obvious Plants and some algae have alternation of generations in which they have multicellular diploid
and haploid life stages that are apparent to different degrees depending on the group
Nearly all animals employ a diploiddominant lifecycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the
