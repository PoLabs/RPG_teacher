Figure 426 Lymphocytes such as NK cells are characterized by their large nuclei that actively absorb Wright stain
and therefore appear dark colored under a microscope
An infected cell or a tumor cell is usually incapable of synthesizing and displaying MHC I molecules
appropriately The metabolic resources of cells infected by some viruses produce proteins that interfere with
MHC I processing andor trafficking to the cell surface The reduced MHC I on host cells varies from virus to virus
and results from active inhibitors being produced by the viruses This process can deplete host MHC I molecules
on the cell surface which NK cells detect as unhealthy or abnormal while searching for cellular MHC I
molecules Similarly the dramatically altered gene expression of tumor cells leads to expression of extremely
deformed or absent MHC I molecules that also signal unhealthy or abnormal
NK cells are always active an interaction with normal intact MHC I molecules on a healthy cell disables the
killing sequence and the NK cell moves on After the NK cell detects an infected or tumor cell its cytoplasm
secretes granules comprised of perforin a destructive protein that creates a pore in the target cell Granzymes
are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse A granzyme is a protease that digests
cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo programmed cell death or apoptosis Phagocytic cells
then digest the cell debris left behind NK cells are constantly patrolling the body and are an effective mechanism
for controlling potential infections and preventing cancer progression
Complement
An array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins called a complement system functions to destroy
extracellular pathogens Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously
these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting
microorganisms The complement system is so named because it is complementary to the antibody response of
the adaptive immune system Complement proteins bind to the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly
attracted to pathogens that are already bound by antibodies Binding of complement proteins occurs in a specific
and highly regulated sequence with each successive protein being activated by cleavage andor structural
changes induced upon binding of the preceding proteins After the first few complement proteins bind a
cascade of sequential binding events follows in which the pathogen rapidly becomes coated in complement
proteins
Complement proteins perform several functions The proteins serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a
pathogen to phagocytic cells such as macrophages and B cells and enhance engulfment this process is called
opsonization Certain complement proteins can combine to form attack complexes that open pores in microbial
cell membranes These structures destroy pathogens by causing their contents to leak as illustrated in Figure
