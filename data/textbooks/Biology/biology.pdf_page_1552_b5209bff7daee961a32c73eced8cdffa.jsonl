A 6 C 8 C 10 C 12 A 14 A 16 A closed circulatory system is a closedloop system in which blood is not free in
a cavity Blood is separate from the bodily interstitial fluid and contained within blood vessels In this type of system
blood circulates unidirectionally from the heart around the systemic circulatory route and then returns to the heart 18
Red blood cells are coated with proteins called antigens made of glycolipids and glycoproteins When type A and type
B blood are mixed the blood agglutinates because of antibodies in the plasma that bind with the opposing antigen
Type O blood has no antigens The Rh blood group has either the Rh antigen Rh or no Rh antigen Rh 20
Lymph capillaries take fluid from the blood to the lymph nodes The lymph nodes filter the lymph by percolation through
connective tissue filled with white blood cells The white blood cells remove infectious agents such as bacteria and
viruses to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream 22 The capillaries basically exchange materials with
their surroundings Their walls are very thin and are made of one or two layers of cells where gases nutrients and
waste are diffused They are distributed as beds complex networks that link arteries as well as veins

1 Figure 415 C 3 Figure 418 Loop diuretics decrease the excretion of salt into the renal medulla thereby reducing
its osmolality As a result less water is excreted into the medulla by the descending limb and more water is excreted
as urine 4 B 6 A 8 B 10 C 12 D 14 C 16 C 18 Excretion allows an organism to rid itself of waste molecules that
could be toxic if allowed to accumulate It also allows the organism to keep the amount of water and dissolved solutes
in balance 20 The loop of Henle is part of the renal tubule that loops into the renal medulla In the loop of Henle
the filtrate exchanges solutes and water with the renal medulla and the vasa recta the peritubular capillary network
The vasa recta acts as the countercurrent exchanger The kidneys maintain the osmolality of the rest of the body at a
constant 300 mOsm by concentrating the filtrate as it passes through the loop of Henle 22 The removal of wastes
which could otherwise be toxic to an organism is extremely important for survival Having organs that specialize in
this process and that operate separately from other organs provides a measure of safety for the organism 24 It
is believed that the urea cycle evolved to adapt to a changing environment when terrestrial life forms evolved Arid
conditions probably led to the evolution of the uric acid pathway as a means of conserving water 26 Hormones
are small molecules that act as messengers within the body Different regions of the nephron bear specialized cells
which have receptors to respond to chemical messengers and hormones The hormones carry messages to the
kidney These hormonal cues help the kidneys synchronize the osmotic needs of the body Hormones like epinephrine
norepinephrine reninangiotensin aldosterone antidiuretic hormone and atrial natriuretic peptide help regulate the
needs of the body as well as the communication between the different organ systems

1 Figure 4211 C 3 Figure 4216 If the blood of the mother and fetus mixes memory cells that recognize the Rh
antigen can form late in the first pregnancy During subsequent pregnancies these memory cells launch an immune
attack on the fetal blood cells Injection of antiRh antibody during the first pregnancy prevents the immune response
from occurring 4 D 6 A 8 D 10 B 12 D 14 C 16 C 18 D 20 C 22 If the MHC I molecules expressed on donor
cells differ from the MHC I molecules expressed on recipient cells NK cells may identify the donor cells as non
self and produce perforin and granzymes to induce the donor cells to undergo apoptosis which would destroy the
transplanted organ 24 An antigen is a molecule that reacts with some component of the immune response antibody
B cell receptor T cell receptor An epitope is the region on the antigen through which binding with the immune
component actually occurs 26 The TH1 response involves the secretion of cytokines to stimulate macrophages and
CTLs and improve their destruction of intracellular pathogens and tumor cells It is associated with inflammation The
TH2 response is involved in the stimulation of B cells into plasma cells that synthesize and secrete antibodies 28 T
cells bind antigens that have been digested and embedded in MHC molecules by APCs In contrast B cells function
themselves as APCs to bind intact unprocessed antigens 30 Cross reactivity of antibodies can be beneficial when it
allows an individuals immune system to respond to an array of similar pathogens after being exposed to just one of
them A potential cost of cross reactivity is an antibody response to parts of the body self in addition to the appropriate
antigen

D 31 Sexual reproduction produces a new combination of genes in the offspring that may better enable them to
survive changes in the environment and assist in the survival of the species 33 External fertilization can create large
numbers of offspring without requiring specialized delivery or reproductive support organs Offspring develop and
mature quickly compared to internally fertilizing species A disadvantage is that the offspring are out in the environment
and predation can account for large loss of offspring The embryos are susceptible to changes in the environment
which further depletes their numbers Internally fertilizing species control their environment and protect their offspring
from predators but must have specialized organs to complete these tasks and usually produce fewer embryos 35 In
phase one excitement vasodilation leads to vasocongestion and enlargement of erectile tissues Vaginal secretions
are released to lubricate the vagina during intercourse In phase two plateau stimulation continues the outer third
