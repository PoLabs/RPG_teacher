in size to modernday mosses although some could reach one meter in height The later genus Cooksonia
which flourished during the Silurian has been extensively studied from wellpreserved examples Imprints
of Cooksonia show slender branching stems ending in what appear to be sporangia From the recovered
specimens it is not possible to establish for certain whether Cooksonia possessed vascular tissues Fossils
indicate that by the end of the Devonian period ferns horsetails and seed plants populated the landscape
giving rising to trees and forests This luxuriant vegetation helped enrich the atmosphere with oxygen making
it easier for airbreathing animals to colonize dry land Plants also established early symbiotic relationships with
fungi creating mycorrhizae a relationship in which the fungal network of filaments increases the efficiency of the
plant root system and the plants provide the fungi with byproducts of photosynthesis
Paleobotanist
How organisms acquired traits that allow them to colonize new environmentsand how the contemporary
ecosystem is shapedare fundamental questions of evolution Paleobotany the study of extinct plants
addresses these questions through the analysis of fossilized specimens retrieved from field studies
reconstituting the morphology of organisms that disappeared long ago Paleobotanists trace the evolution of
plants by following the modifications in plant morphology shedding light on the connection between existing
plants by identifying common ancestors that display the same traits This field seeks to find transitional
species that bridge gaps in the path to the development of modern organisms Fossils are formed when
organisms are trapped in sediments or environments where their shapes are preserved Paleobotanists
collect fossil specimens in the field and place them in the context of the geological sediments and other
fossilized organisms surrounding them The activity requires great care to preserve the integrity of the
delicate fossils and the layers of rock in which they are found
One of the most exciting recent developments in paleobotany is the use of analytical chemistry and
molecular biology to study fossils Preservation of molecular structures requires an environment free of
oxygen since oxidation and degradation of material through the activity of microorganisms depend on its
presence One example of the use of analytical chemistry and molecular biology is the identification of
oleanane a compound that deters pests Up to this point oleanane appeared to be unique to flowering
plants however it has now been recovered from sediments dating from the Permian much earlier than
the current dates given for the appearance of the first flowering plants Paleobotanists can also study fossil
DNA which can yield a large amount of information by analyzing and comparing the DNA sequences of
extinct plants with those of living and related organisms Through this analysis evolutionary relationships
can be built for plant lineages
Some paleobotanists are skeptical of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of molecular fossils For
example the chemical materials of interest degrade rapidly when exposed to air during their initial isolation
as well as in further manipulations There is always a high risk of contaminating the specimens with
extraneous material mostly from microorganisms Nevertheless as technology is refined the analysis of
DNA from fossilized plants will provide invaluable information on the evolution of plants and their adaptation
to an everchanging environment
The Major Divisions of Land Plants
The green algae and land plants are grouped together into a subphylum called the Streptophyta and thus are
called Streptophytes In a further division land plants are classified into two major groups according to the
absence or presence of vascular tissue as detailed in Figure 256 Plants that lack vascular tissue which is
formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients are referred to as nonvascular plants
Liverworts mosses and hornworts are seedless nonvascular plants that likely appeared early in land plant
evolution Vascular plants developed a network of cells that conduct water and solutes The first vascular
plants appeared in the late Ordovician 500 to 435 MYA and were probably similar to lycophytes which
include club mosses not to be confused with the mosses and the pterophytes ferns horsetails and whisk
ferns Lycophytes and pterophytes are referred to as seedless vascular plants because they do not produce
seeds The seed plants or spermatophytes form the largest group of all existing plants and hence dominate
the landscape Seed plants include gymnosperms most notably conifers which produce naked seeds and
the most successful of all plants the flowering plants angiosperms Angiosperms protect their seeds inside
