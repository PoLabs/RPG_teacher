inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms Larger
elements have additional orbitals comprising the third electron shell While the concepts of electron shells
and orbitals are closely related orbitals provide a more accurate depiction of an atoms electron configuration
because the orbital model specifies the different shapes and special orientations of all the places that electrons
may occupy

Chemical Reactions and Molecules
All elements are most stable when their outermost shell is filled with electrons according to the octet rule This
is because it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable However
since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells atoms form chemical bonds with
other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration When two or
more atoms chemically bond with each other the resultant chemical structure is a molecule The familiar water
molecule H2O consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom These bond together to form water as
Figure 29 illustrates Atoms can form molecules by donating accepting or sharing electrons to fill their outer
shells
Figure 29 Two or more atoms may bond with each other to form a molecule When two hydrogens and an oxygen
share electrons via covalent bonds it forms a water molecule
Chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms
break apart Scientists call the substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction reactants usually on
the left side of a chemical equation and we call the substances at the end of the reaction products usually on
the right side of a chemical equation We typically draw an arrow between the reactants and products to indicate
the chemical reactions direction This direction is not always a oneway street To create the water molecule
above the chemical equation would be
2H  O  H2 O
An example of a simple chemical reaction is breaking down hydrogen peroxide molecules each of which
consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to two oxygen atoms H2O2 The reactant hydrogen peroxide breaks
down into water containing one oxygen atom bound to two hydrogen atoms H2O and oxygen which consists
of two bonded oxygen atoms O2 In the equation below the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules
and two water molecules This is an example of a balanced chemical equation wherein each elements
