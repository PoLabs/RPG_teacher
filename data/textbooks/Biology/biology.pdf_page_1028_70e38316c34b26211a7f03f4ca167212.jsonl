Bone
Bone or osseous tissue is a connective tissue that has a large amount of two different types of matrix material
The organic matrix is similar to the matrix material found in other connective tissues including some amount
of collagen and elastic fibers This gives strength and flexibility to the tissue The inorganic matrix consists of
mineral saltsmostly calcium saltsthat give the tissue hardness Without adequate organic material in the
matrix the tissue breaks without adequate inorganic material in the matrix the tissue bends
There are three types of cells in bone osteoblasts osteocytes and osteoclasts Osteoblasts are active in
making bone for growth and remodeling Osteoblasts deposit bone material into the matrix and after the matrix
surrounds them they continue to live but in a reduced metabolic state as osteocytes Osteocytes are found
in lacunae of the bone Osteoclasts are active in breaking down bone for bone remodeling and they provide
access to calcium stored in tissues Osteoclasts are usually found on the surface of the tissue
Bone can be divided into two types compact and spongy Compact bone is found in the shaft or diaphysis
of a long bone and the surface of the flat bones while spongy bone is found in the end or epiphysis of a
long bone Compact bone is organized into subunits called osteons as illustrated in Figure 3315 A blood
vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the Haversian canal with radiating circles
of lacunae around it known as lamellae The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called
canaliculi they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells Spongy bone is made of tiny plates
called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength Over time these plates can
break causing the bone to become less resilient Bone tissue forms the internal skeleton of vertebrate animals
providing structure to the animal and points of attachment for tendons
