Figure 147 DNA has a a double helix structure and b phosphodiester bonds the dotted lines between Thymine
and Adenine and Guanine and Cytosine represent hydrogen bonds The c major and minor grooves are binding sites
for DNA binding proteins during processes such as transcription the copying of RNA from DNA and replication
DNA Sequencing Techniques
Until the 1990s the sequencing of DNA reading the sequence of DNA was a relatively expensive and long
process Using radiolabeled nucleotides also compounded the problem through safety concerns With currently
available technology and automated machines the process is cheaper safer and can be completed in a matter
of hours Fred Sanger developed the sequencing method used for the human genome sequencing project which
is widely used today Figure 148

sequencereading technique that resulted from Sangers work
The sequencing method is known as the dideoxy chain termination method The method is based on the use
of chain terminators the dideoxynucleotides ddNTPs The ddNTPSs differ from the deoxynucleotides by the
lack of a free 3 OH group on the fivecarbon sugar If a ddNTP is added to a growing DNA strand the chain
cannot be extended any further because the free 3 OH group needed to add another nucleotide is not available
By using a predetermined ratio of deoxyribonucleotides to dideoxynucleotides it is possible to generate DNA
fragments of different sizes
Figure 148 In Frederick Sangers dideoxy chain termination method dyelabeled dideoxynucleotides are used to
generate DNA fragments that terminate at different points The DNA is separated by capillary electrophoresis not
defined on the basis of size and from the order of fragments formed the DNA sequence can be read The DNA
sequence readout is shown on an electropherogram not defined that is generated by a laser scanner
The DNA sample to be sequenced is denatured separated into two strands by heating it to high temperatures
The DNA is divided into four tubes in which a primer DNA polymerase and all four nucleoside triphosphates
A T G and C are added In addition limited quantities of one of the four dideoxynucleoside triphosphates
