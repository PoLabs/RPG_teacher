154  RNA Processing in Eukaryotes
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the different steps in RNA processing

Understand the significance of exons introns and splicing for mRNAs

Explain how tRNAs and rRNAs are processed
After transcription eukaryotic premRNAs must undergo several processing steps before they can be translated
Eukaryotic and prokaryotic tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as
components in the proteinsynthesis machinery
mRNA Processing
The eukaryotic premRNA undergoes extensive processing before it is ready to be translated Eukaryotic
proteincoding sequences are not continuous as they are in prokaryotes The coding sequences exons are
interrupted by noncoding introns which must be removed to make a translatable mRNA The additional steps
involved in eukaryotic mRNA maturation also create a molecule with a much longer halflife than a prokaryotic
mRNA Eukaryotic mRNAs last for several hours whereas the typical E coli mRNA lasts no more than five
seconds
PremRNAs are first coated in RNAstabilizing proteins these protect the premRNA from degradation while it
is processed and exported out of the nucleus The three most important steps of premRNA processing are the
addition of stabilizing and signaling factors at the 5 and 3 ends of the molecule and the removal of the introns
Figure 1511 In rare cases the mRNA transcript can be edited after it is transcribed
Figure 1511 Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be spliced out A 5 cap and 3 polyA tail are also added
