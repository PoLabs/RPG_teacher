Opisthokonta
The Opisthokonts are named for the single posterior flagellum seen in flagellated cells of the group The flagella
of other protists are anterior and their movement pulls the cells along while the opisthokonts are pushed Protist
members of the opisthokonts include the animallike choanoflagellates which are believed to resemble the
common ancestor of sponges and perhaps all animals Choanoflagellates include unicellular and colonial forms
Figure 2316 and number about 244 described species In these organisms the single apical flagellum is
surrounded by a contractile collar composed of microvilli The collar is used to filter and collect bacteria for
ingestion by the protist A similar feeding mechanism is seen in the collar cells of sponges which suggests a
possible connection between choanoflagellates and animals
The Mesomycetozoa form a small group of parasites primarily of fish and at least one form that can parasitize
humans Their life cycles are poorly understood These organisms are of special interest because they appear
to be so closely related to animals In the past they were grouped with fungi and other protists based on their
morphology
