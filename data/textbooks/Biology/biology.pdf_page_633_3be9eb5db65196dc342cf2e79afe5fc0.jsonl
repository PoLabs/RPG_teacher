CHAPTER SUMMARY
221 Prokaryotic Diversity
Prokaryotes existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared Hot springs and hydrothermal
vents may have been the environments in which life began Microbial mats are thought to represent the earliest
forms of life on Earth A microbial mat is a multilayered sheet of prokaryotes that grows at interfaces between
different types of material mostly on moist surfaces Fossilized microbial mats are called stromatolites and
consist of laminated organosedimentary structures formed by precipitation of minerals by prokaryotes They
represent the earliest fossil record of life on Earth
During the first two billion years the atmosphere was anoxic and only anaerobic organisms were able to live
Cyanobacteria evolved from early phototrophs and began the oxygenation o the atmosphere The increase in
oxygen concentration allowed the evolution of other life forms
Bacteria and archaea grow in virtually every environment Those that survive under extreme conditions are
called extremophiles extreme lovers Some prokaryotes cannot grow in a laboratory setting but they are not
dead They are in the viablebutnonculturable VBNC state The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes enter
a dormant state in response to environmental stressors Most prokaryotes are colonial and prefer to live in
communities where interactions take place A biofilm is a microbial community held together in a gummy
textured matrix
222 Structure of Prokaryotes Bacteria and Archaea
Prokaryotes domains Archaea and Bacteria are singlecelled organisms that lack a nucleus They have a
single piece of circular DNA in the nucleoid area of the cell Most prokaryotes have a cell wall that lies outside
the boundary of the plasma membrane Some prokaryotes may have additional structures such as a capsule
flagella and pili Bacteria and Archaea differ in the lipid composition of their cell membranes and the
characteristics of the cell wall In archaeal membranes phytanyl units rather than fatty acids are linked to
glycerol Some archaeal membranes are lipid monolayers instead of bilayers
The cell wall is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis The chemical composition of cell
walls varies between species Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan Archaean cell walls do not have
peptidoglycan but they may have pseudopeptidoglycan polysaccharides glycoproteins or proteinbased cell
walls Bacteria can be divided into two major groups Gram positive and Gram negative based on the Gram
stain reaction Grampositive organisms have a thick peptidoglycan layer fortified with teichoic acids Gram
negative organisms have a thin cell wall and an outer envelope containing lipopolysaccharides and
lipoproteins
Prokaryotes can transfer DNA from one cell to another by three mechanisms transformation uptake of
environmental DNA transduction transfer of genomic DNA via viruses and conjugation transfer of DNA by
direct cell contact
223 Prokaryotic Metabolism
As the oldest living inhabitants of Earth prokaryotes are also the most metabolically diverse they flourish in
many different environments with various energy and carbon sources variable temperature pH pressure
oxygen and water availability Nutrients required in large amounts are called macronutrients whereas those
required in trace amounts are called micronutrients or trace elements Macronutrients include C H O N P S
K Mg Ca and Na In addition to these macronutrients prokaryotes require various metallic elements for
growth and enzyme function Prokaryotes use different sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from
smaller molecules Phototrophs obtain their energy from sunlight whereas chemotrophs obtain energy from
chemical compounds Energyproducing pathways may be either aerobic or anaerobic
Prokaryotes play roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycles Producers capture carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere and convert it to organic compounds Consumers animals and other chemoorganotrophic
organisms use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
by respiration Carbon dioxide is also returned to the atmosphere by the microbial decomposers of dead
organisms Nitrogen also cycles in and out of living organisms from organic compounds to ammonia
ammonium ions nitrite nitrate and nitrogen gas Prokaryotes are essential for most of these conversions
Gaseous nitrogen is transformed into ammonia through nitrogen fixation Ammonia is anaerobically catabolized
by some prokaryotes yielding N2 as the final product Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium into nitrite
