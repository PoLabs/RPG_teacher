Collenchyma cells are elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls Figure 306 They provide structural
support mainly to the stem and leaves These cells are alive at maturity and are usually found below the
epidermis The strings of a celery stalk are an example of collenchyma cells
Figure 306 Collenchyma cell walls are uneven in thickness as seen in this light micrograph They provide support to
plant structures credit modification of work by Carl Szczerski scalebar data from Matt Russell
Sclerenchyma cells also provide support to the plant but unlike collenchyma cells many of them are dead at
maturity There are two types of sclerenchyma cells fibers and sclereids Both types have secondary cell walls
that are thickened with deposits of lignin an organic compound that is a key component of wood Fibers are long
slender cells sclereids are smallersized Sclereids give pears their gritty texture Humans use sclerenchyma
fibers to make linen and rope Figure 307
