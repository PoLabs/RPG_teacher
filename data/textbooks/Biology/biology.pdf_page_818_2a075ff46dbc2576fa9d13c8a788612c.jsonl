Phylum Rotifera
The rotifers wheelbearer belong to a group of microscopic about 100 m to 2 mm mostly aquatic animals
that get their name from the coronaa pair of ciliated feeding structures that appear to rotate when viewed
under the light microscope Figure 2817 Although their taxonomic status is currently in flux one treatment
places the rotifers in three classes Bdelloidea Monogononta and Seisonidea In addition the parasitic spiny
headed worms currently in phylum Acanthocephala appear to be modified rotifers and will probably be placed
into the group in the near future Undoubtedly the rotifers will continue to be revised as more phylogenetic
evidence becomes available
The pseudocoelomate body of a rotifer is remarkably complex for such a small animal roughly the size of a
Paramecium and is divided into three sections a head which contains the corona a trunk which contains
most of the internal organs and the foot A cuticle rigid in some species and flexible in others covers the body
surface They have both skeletal muscle associated with locomotion and visceral muscles associated with the
gut both composed of single cells Rotifers are typically freeswimming or planktonic drifting organisms but the
toes or extensions of the foot can secrete a sticky material to help them adhere to surfaces The head contains
a number of eyespots and a bilobed brain with nerves extending into the body
Figure 2817 Rotifers Shown are examples from two of the three classes of rotifer a Species from the class
Bdelloidea are characterized by a large corona The whole animals in the center of this scanning electron micrograph
are shown surrounded by several sets of jaws from the mastax of rotifers b Polyarthra from the largest rotifer class
Monogononta has a smaller corona than bdelloid rotifers and a single gonad which give the class its name credit a

Rotifers are commonly found in freshwater and some saltwater environments throughout the world As filter
feeders they will eat dead material algae and other microscopic living organisms and are therefore very
important components of aquatic food webs A rotifers food is directed toward the mouth by the current created
from the movement of the coronal cilia The food particles enter the mouth and travel first to the mastaxa
muscular pharynx with toothy jawlike structures Examples of the jaws of various rotifers are seen in Figure
2817a Masticated food passes near digestive and salivary glands into the stomach and then to the intestines
Digestive and excretory wastes are collected in a cloacal bladder before being released out the anus

About 2200 species of rotifers have been identified Figure 2818 shows the anatomy of a rotifer belonging
to class Bdelloidea Some rotifers are dioecious organisms and exhibit sexual dimorphism males and females
have different forms In many dioecious species males are shortlived and smaller with no digestive system
