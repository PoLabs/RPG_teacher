its cytoplasmic surface give it a studded appearance when viewing it through an electron microscope Figure

Figure 419 This transmission electron micrograph shows the rough endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles in a
pancreatic cell credit modification of work by Louisa Howard
Ribosomes transfer their newly synthesized proteins into the RERs lumen where they undergo structural
modifications such as folding or acquiring side chains These modified proteins incorporate into cellular
membranesthe ER or the ERs or other organelles membranes The proteins can also secrete from the cell
such as protein hormones enzymes The RER also makes phospholipids for cellular membranes
If the phospholipids or modified proteins are not destined to stay in the RER they will reach their destinations
via transport vesicles that bud from the RERs membrane Figure 418
Since the RER is engaged in modifying proteins such as enzymes for example that secrete from the cell you
would be correct in assuming that the RER is abundant in cells that secrete proteins This is the case with liver
cells for example
Smooth ER
The smooth endoplasmic reticulum SER is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on
its cytoplasmic surface Figure 418 SER functions include synthesis of carbohydrates lipids and steroid
hormones detoxification of medications and poisons and storing calcium ions
In muscle cells a specialized SER the sarcoplasmic reticulum is responsible for storing calcium ions that are
needed to trigger the muscle cells coordinated contractions
