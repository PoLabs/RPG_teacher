What is biology In simple terms biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another
and their environments This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast Biologists may
study anything from the microscopic or submicroscopic view of a cell to ecosystems and the whole living planet
Figure 12 Listening to the daily news you will quickly realize how many aspects of biology we discuss every
day For example recent news topics include Escherichia coli Figure 13 outbreaks in spinach and Salmonella
contamination in peanut butter Other subjects include efforts toward finding a cure for AIDS Alzheimers
disease and cancer On a global scale many researchers are committed to finding ways to protect the planet
solve environmental issues and reduce the effects of climate change All of these diverse endeavors are related
to different facets of the discipline of biology

tracts that aid in absorbing vitamin K and other nutrients However virulent strains are sometimes responsible for
disease outbreaks credit Eric Erbe digital colorization by Christopher Pooley both of USDA ARS EMU
The Process of Science
Biology is a science but what exactly is science What does the study of biology share with other scientific
disciplines We can define science from the Latin scientia meaning knowledge as knowledge that covers
general truths or the operation of general laws especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method It
becomes clear from this definition that applying scientific method plays a major role in science The scientific
method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation
We will examine scientific method steps in detail later but one of the most important aspects of this method is
the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for
an event which one can test Although using the scientific method is inherent to science it is inadequate in
determining what science is This is because it is relatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines
