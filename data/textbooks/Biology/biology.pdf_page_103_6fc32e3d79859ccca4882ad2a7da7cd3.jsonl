Figure 328 The helix and pleated sheet are secondary structures of proteins that form because of hydrogen
bonding between carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide backbone Certain amino acids have a propensity to form
an helix while others have a propensity to form a pleated sheet
Every helical turn in an alpha helix has 36 amino acid residues The polypeptides R groups the variant groups
protrude out from the helix chain In the pleated sheet hydrogen bonding between atoms on the polypeptide
chains backbone form the pleats The R groups are attached to the carbons and extend above and below
the pleats folds The pleated segments align parallel or antiparallel to each other and hydrogen bonds form
between the partially positive nitrogen atom in the amino group and the partially negative oxygen atom in the
peptide backbones carbonyl group The helix and pleated sheet structures are in most globular and fibrous
proteins and they play an important structural role
Tertiary Structure
The polypeptides unique threedimensional structure is its tertiary structure Figure 329 This structure is in
part due to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain Primarily the interactions among R groups
create the proteins complex threedimensional tertiary structure The nature of the R groups in the amino
acids involved can counteract forming the hydrogen bonds we described for standard secondary structures
For example R groups with like charges repel each other and those with unlike charges are attracted to each
other ionic bonds When protein folding takes place the nonpolar amino acids hydrophobic R groups lie in the
proteins interior whereas the hydrophilic R groups lie on the outside Scientists also call the former interaction
types hydrophobic interactions Interaction between cysteine side chains forms disulfide linkages in the presence
of oxygen the only covalent bond that forms during protein folding
