electrons that reduce NAD to NADH and release carboxyl groups that form CO2 molecules Alphaketoglutarate
is the product of step three and a succinyl group is the product of step four CoA binds with the succinyl group
to form succinyl CoA The enzyme that catalyzes step four is regulated by feedback inhibition of ATP succinyl
CoA and NADH
Step 5 In step five a phosphate group is substituted for coenzyme A and a highenergy bond is formed This
energy is used in substratelevel phosphorylation during the conversion of the succinyl group to succinate to
form either guanine triphosphate GTP or ATP There are two forms of the enzyme called isoenzymes for this
step depending upon the type of animal tissue in which they are found One form is found in tissues that use
large amounts of ATP such as heart and skeletal muscle This form produces ATP The second form of the
enzyme is found in tissues that have a high number of anabolic pathways such as liver This form produces
GTP GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP however its use is more restricted In particular protein synthesis
primarily uses GTP
Step 6 Step six is a dehydration process that converts succinate into fumarate Two hydrogen atoms are
transferred to FAD reducing it to FADH2 Note the energy contained in the electrons of these hydrogens is
insufficient to reduce NAD but adequate to reduce FAD Unlike NADH this carrier remains attached to the
enzyme and transfers the electrons to the electron transport chain directly This process is made possible by the
localization of the enzyme catalyzing this step inside the inner membrane of the mitochondrion
Step 7 Water is added by hydrolysis to fumarate during step seven and malate is produced The last step in
the citric acid cycle regenerates oxaloacetate by oxidizing malate Another molecule of NADH is then produced
in the process

Products of the Citric Acid Cycle
Two carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group representing four out of the six carbons
of one glucose molecule Two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle however these
do not necessarily contain the most recently added carbon atoms The two acetyl carbon atoms will eventually be
released on later turns of the cycle thus all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are eventually
incorporated into carbon dioxide Each turn of the cycle forms three NADH molecules and one FADH2 molecule
These carriers will connect with the last portion of aerobic respiration the electron transport chain to produce
ATP molecules One GTP or ATP is also made in each cycle Several of the intermediate compounds in the
citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing nonessential amino acids therefore the cycle is amphibolic both
catabolic and anabolic
74  Oxidative Phosphorylation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how electrons move through the electron transport chain and explain what happens to their
energy levels during this process

Explain how a proton H gradient is established and maintained by the electron transport chain
You have just read about two pathways in glucose catabolismglycolysis and the citric acid cyclethat
generate ATP Most of the ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose however is not generated
directly from these pathways Instead it is derived from a process that begins by moving electrons through
a series of electron carriers that undergo redox reactions This process causes hydrogen ions to accumulate
within the matrix space Therefore a concentration gradient forms in which hydrogen ions diffuse out of the
