However unresolved questions about the animal diversification that took place during the Cambrian period
remain For example we do not understand how the evolution of so many species occurred in such a short
period of time Was there really an explosion of life at this particular time Some scientists question the
validity of this idea because there is increasing evidence to suggest that more animal life existed prior to the
Cambrian period and that other similar species socalled explosions or radiations occurred later in history as
well Furthermore the vast diversification of animal species that appears to have begun during the Cambrian
period continued well into the following Ordovician period Despite some of these arguments most scientists
agree that the Cambrian period marked a time of impressively rapid animal evolution and diversification of body
forms that is unmatched for any other time period

PostCambrian Evolution and Mass Extinctions
The periods that followed the Cambrian during the Paleozoic Era are marked by further animal evolution and
the emergence of many new orders families and species As animal phyla continued to diversify new species
adapted to new ecological niches During the Ordovician period which followed the Cambrian period plant life
first appeared on land This change allowed formerly aquatic animal species to invade land feeding directly on
plants or decaying vegetation Continual changes in temperature and moisture throughout the remainder of the
Paleozoic Era due to continental plate movements encouraged the development of new adaptations to terrestrial
existence in animals such as limbed appendages in amphibians and epidermal scales in reptiles
Changes in the environment often create new niches diversified living spaces that invite rapid speciation
and increased diversity On the other hand cataclysmic events such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes
that obliterate life can result in devastating losses of diversity to some clades yet provide new opportunities
for others to fill in the gaps and speciate Such periods of mass extinction Figure 2719 have occurred
repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life erasing some genetic lines while creating room for others to evolve
into the empty niches left behind The end of the Permian period and the Paleozoic Era was marked by the
