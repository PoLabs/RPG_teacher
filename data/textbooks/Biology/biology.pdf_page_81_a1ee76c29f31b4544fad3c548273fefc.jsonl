involve the formation of new bonds requiring energy while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and release energy
These reactions are similar for most macromolecules but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for
its class For example catalytic enzymes in the digestive system hydrolyze or break down the food we ingest
into smaller molecules This allows cells in our body to easily absorb nutrients in the intestine A specific
enzyme breaks down each macromolecule For instance amylase sucrase lactase or maltase break down
carbohydrates Enzymes called proteases such as pepsin and peptidase and hydrochloric acid break down
proteins Lipases break down lipids These broken down macromolecules provide energy for cellular activities

32  Carbohydrates
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the role of carbohydrates in cells and in the extracellular materials of animals and plants

Explain carbohydrate classifications

List common monosaccharides disaccharides and polysaccharides
Most people are familiar with carbohydrates one type of macromolecule especially when it comes to what we
eat To lose weight some individuals adhere to lowcarb diets Athletes in contrast often carbload before
important competitions to ensure that they have enough energy to compete at a high level Carbohydrates are in
fact an essential part of our diet Grains fruits and vegetables are all natural carbohydrate sources that provide
energy to the body particularly through glucose a simple sugar that is a component of starch and an ingredient
in many staple foods Carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans animals and plants
Molecular Structures
The stoichiometric formula CH2On where n is the number of carbons in the molecule represents
carbohydrates In other words the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 121 in carbohydrate molecules
This formula also explains the origin of the term carbohydrate the components are carbon carbo and
the
components
of
water
hence
hydrate
Scientists
classify
carbohydrates
into
three
subtypes
monosaccharides disaccharides and polysaccharides
Monosaccharides
Monosaccharides mono  one sacchar  sweet are simple sugars the most common of which is
glucose In monosaccharides the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven Most monosaccharide
names end with the suffix ose If the sugar has an aldehyde group the functional group with the structure R
CHO it is an aldose and if it has a ketone group the functional group with the structure RCOR it is a
ketose Depending on the number of carbons in the sugar they can be trioses three carbons pentoses five
carbons andor hexoses six carbons Figure 34 illustrates monosaccharides
