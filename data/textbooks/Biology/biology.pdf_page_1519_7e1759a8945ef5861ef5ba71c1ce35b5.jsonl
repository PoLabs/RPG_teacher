Early evidence suggests that another fungal pathogen Geomyces destructans introduced from Europe is
responsible for whitenose syndrome which infects cavehibernating bats in eastern North America and has
spread from a point of origin in western New York State Figure 4714 The disease has decimated bat
populations and threatens extinction of species already listed as endangered the Indiana bat Myotis sodalis
and potentially the Virginia bigeared bat Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus How the fungus was introduced
is unclear but one logical presumption would be that recreational cavers unintentionally brought the fungus on
clothes or equipment from Europe
