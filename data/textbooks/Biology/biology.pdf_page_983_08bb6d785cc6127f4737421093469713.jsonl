If the anther is missing what type of reproductive structure will the flower be unable to produce What term
is used to describe an incomplete flower lacking the androecium What term describes an incomplete flower
lacking a gynoecium
If all four whorls the calyx corolla androecium and gynoecium are present the flower is described as
complete If any of the four parts is missing the flower is known as incomplete Flowers that contain both
an androecium and a gynoecium are called perfect androgynous or hermaphrodites There are two types
of incomplete flowers staminate flowers contain only an androecium and carpellate flowers have only a
gynoecium Figure 324
