cross the membrane otherwise the solute crossing the membrane would balance concentrations on each side
If the solutions volume on both sides of the membrane is the same but the solutes concentrations are different
then there are different amounts of water the solvent on either side of the membrane
Figure 511 In osmosis water always moves from an area of higher water concentration to one of lower concentration
In the diagram the solute cannot pass through the selectively permeable membrane but the water can
To illustrate this imagine two full water glasses One has a single teaspoon of sugar in it whereas the second
one contains onequarter cup of sugar If the total volume of the solutions in both cups is the same which cup
contains more water Because the large sugar amount in the second cup takes up much more space than the
teaspoon of sugar in the first cup the first cup has more water in it
Returning to the beaker example recall that it has a solute mixture on either side of the membrane A principle
of diffusion is that the molecules move around and will spread evenly throughout the medium if they can
However only the material capable of getting through the membrane will diffuse through it In this example
the solute cannot diffuse through the membrane but the water can Water has a concentration gradient in this
system Thus water will diffuse down its concentration gradient crossing the membrane to the side where it
is less concentrated This diffusion of water through the membraneosmosiswill continue until the waters
concentration gradient goes to zero or until the waters hydrostatic pressure balances the osmotic pressure
Osmosis proceeds constantly in living systems
Tonicity
Tonicity describes how an extracellular solution can change a cells volume by affecting osmosis A solutions
tonicity often directly correlates with the solutions osmolarity Osmolarity describes the solutions total solute
concentration A solution with low osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of
solute particles A solution with high osmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles In a
situation in which a membrane permeable to water though not to the solute separates two different osmolarities
water will move from the membranes side with lower osmolarity and more water to the side with higher
osmolarity and less water This effect makes sense if you remember that the solute cannot move across
the membrane and thus the only component in the system that can movethe watermoves along its own
concentration gradient An important distinction that concerns living systems is that osmolarity measures the
number of particles which may be molecules in a solution Therefore a solution that is cloudy with cells may
have a lower osmolarity than a solution that is clear if the second solution contains more dissolved molecules
than there are cells
Hypotonic Solutions
Scientists use three termshypotonic isotonic and hypertonicto relate the cells osmolarity to the
extracellular fluids osmolarity that contains the cells In a hypotonic situation the extracellular fluid has lower
osmolarity than the fluid inside the cell and water enters the cell In living systems the point of reference is
always the cytoplasm so the prefix hypo means that the extracellular fluid has a lower solute concentration
or a lower osmolarity than the cell cytoplasm It also means that the extracellular fluid has a higher water
concentration in the solution than does the cell In this situation water will follow its concentration gradient and
enter the cell
Hypertonic Solutions
As for a hypertonic solution the prefix hyper refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than
the cells cytoplasm therefore the fluid contains less water than the cell does Because the cell has a relatively
higher water concentration water will leave the cell
