are generally assumed to be more stable environments and this stability might promote speciation into highly
specialized niches
Regardless of the mechanisms it is certainly true that all levels of biodiversity are greatest in the tropics
Additionally the rate of endemism is highest and there are more biodiversity hotspots However this richness
of diversity also means that knowledge of species is unfortunately very low and there is a high potential for
biodiversity loss
Conservation of Biodiversity
In 1988 British environmentalist Norman Myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in
species and at significant risk for species loss biodiversity hotspots Biodiversity hotspots are geographical
areas that contain high numbers of endemic species The purpose of the concept was to identify important
locations on the planet for conservation efforts a kind of conservation triage By protecting hotspots
governments are able to protect a larger number of species The original criteria for a hotspot included the
presence of 1500 or more endemic plant species and 70 percent of the area disturbed by human activity There
are now 34 biodiversity hotspots Figure 474 containing large numbers of endemic species which include half
of Earths endemic plants
Figure 474 Conservation International has identified 34 biodiversity hotspots which cover only 23 percent of the
Earths surface but have endemic to them 42 percent of the terrestrial vertebrate species and 50 percent of the worlds
plants
Biodiversity Change through Geological Time
The number of species on the planet or in any geographical area is the result of an equilibrium of two
evolutionary processes that are continuously ongoing speciation and extinction Both are natural birth and
death processes of macroevolution When speciation rates begin to outstrip extinction rates the number of
species will increase likewise the number of species will decrease when extinction rates begin to overtake
speciation rates Throughout Earths history these two processes have fluctuatedsometimes leading to
dramatic changes in the number of species on Earth as reflected in the fossil record Figure 475
