are generally yellow or orange in color Golden algae are found in both freshwater and marine environments
where they form a major part of the plankton community
The brown algae are primarily marine multicellular organisms that are known colloquially as seaweeds Giant
kelps are a type of brown alga Some brown algae have evolved specialized tissues that resemble terrestrial
plants with rootlike holdfasts stemlike stipes and leaflike blades that are capable of photosynthesis The
stipes of giant kelps are enormous extending in some cases for 60 meters Like the green algae brown algae
have a variety of life cycles including alternation of generations In the brown algae genus Laminaria haploid
spores develop into multicellular gametophytes which produce haploid gametes that combine to produce diploid
organisms that then become multicellular organisms with a different structure from the haploid form Figure

Figure 2328 Alternation of generations in a brown alga Several species of brown algae such as the Laminaria
shown here have evolved life cycles in which both the haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte forms
are multicellular The gametophyte is different in structure than the sporophyte credit laminaria photograph
modification of work by Claire Fackler CINMS NOAA Photo Library
Which of the following statements about the Laminaria life cycle is false
a
1n zoospores form in the sporangia
b
The sporophyte is the 2n plant
c
The gametophyte is diploid
d
Both the gametophyte and sporophyte stages are multicellular
The water molds oomycetes egg fungus were sonamed based on their funguslike morphology but
molecular data have shown that the water molds are not closely related to fungi The oomycetes are
characterized by a cellulosebased cell wall and an extensive network of filaments that allow for nutrient uptake
As diploid spores many oomycetes have two oppositely directed flagella one hairy and one smooth for
locomotion The oomycetes are nonphotosynthetic and include many saprobes and parasites The saprobes
appear as white fluffy growths on dead organisms Figure 2329 Most oomycetes are aquatic but some
parasitize terrestrial plants One plant pathogen is Phytophthora infestans the causative agent of late blight of
potatoes such as occurred in the nineteenth century Irish potato famine
