blood into an open cavity bathing the tissues As the blood diffuses through the tissue space it delivers nutrients in
exchange for receiving metabolic wastes The blood then diffuses back to the heart to be pumped again However
since this system relies on diffusion the size of animals that use an open circulatory system is limited to fairly small
volumes so that the blood can diffuse rapidly enough to efficiently exchange molecules with the tissues
33 Squamous
epithelia can be either simple or stratified As a single layer of cells it presents a very thin epithelia that minimally
inhibits diffusion As a stratified epithelia the surface cells can be sloughed off and the cells in deeper layers protect
the underlying tissues from damage 35 In multiple sclerosis the immune system attacks the oligodendrocytes The
death of oligodendrocytes results in the loss of the insulating sheath around the axon of the neurons When the sheath
is gone the electrical impulses travel much more slowly down the length of the axon
37 An adjustment to a change
in the internal or external environment requires a change in the direction of the stimulus A negative feedback loop
accomplishes this while a positive feedback loop would continue the stimulus and result in harm to the animal 39
Diabetes is often associated with a lack in production of insulin Without insulin blood glucose levels go up after a
meal but never go back down to normal levels

18 B 20 Animals with a polygastric
digestive system have a multichambered stomach The four compartments of the stomach are called the rumen
reticulum omasum and abomasum These chambers contain many microbes that breakdown the cellulose and
ferment the ingested food The abomasum is the true stomach and is the equivalent of a monogastric stomach
chamber where gastric juices are secreted The fourcompartment gastric chamber provides larger space and the
microbial support necessary for ruminants to digest plant material 22 Accessory organs play an important role in
producing and delivering digestive juices to the intestine during digestion and absorption Specifically the salivary
glands liver pancreas and gallbladder play important roles Malfunction of any of these organs can lead to disease
states 24 The stomach and the teeth both perform mechanical digestion which is physically as opposed to
chemically breaking the food into smaller components This exposes a larger surface area for chemical digestion
and release of nutrients The teeth are vital to mastication which breaks large bites of food down into smaller pieces
that are easily swallowed The stomachs muscle contractions churn the food to expose all particles to the acid and
digestive enzymes
26 Mineralssuch as potassium sodium and calciumare required for the functioning of many
cellular processes including muscle contraction and nerve conduction While minerals are required in trace amounts
not having minerals in the diet can be potentially harmful 28 Malnutrition often in the form of not getting enough
calories or not enough of the essential nutrients can have severe consequences Many malnourished children have
vision and dental problems and over the years may develop many serious health problems 30 Fats are an essential
component of a healthy diet and needed by the body to function Fats are essential for many processes including
the absorption of fatsoluble vitamins and production of some hormones Fats also send a satiation signal to the brain
that regulates hunger Without fats in their diets many people may have actually consumed more calories which
would have resulted in weight gain
32 The gut microbiome includes all the bacteria that aid in chemical digestion
in the intestines Changing its composition can change the way that food is digested since not all bacteria have
the same macromoleculedigesting enzymes Additionally changes in gut microbiome can lead to the establishment
of pathogenic bacteria populations that cause inflammation in the gut or other disease
34 Hormones control the
different digestive enzymes that are secreted in the stomach and the intestine during the process of digestion and
absorption For example the hormone gastrin stimulates stomach acid secretion in response to food intake The
hormone somatostatin stops the release of stomach acid 36 Somatostatin is the hormone that inhibits the release
of HCl into the stomach lumen after the chyme has moved to the intestine If the receptor for somatostatin is
nonfunctional somatostatin cannot signal to the stomach parietal cells to stop acid secretion Thus acid secretion
will continue when there is no food present and can cause damage to the stomach tissue However as long as the
stomach remains intact the mutation should not slow digestion since acid will always be present in the stomach to
digest any new boluses of food

24 Neurons contain
organelles common to all cells such as a nucleus and mitochondria They are unique because they contain dendrites
which can receive signals from other neurons and axons that can send these signals to other cells 26 A single
axon means that a neuron can only send one signal at a time one electrical impulse down the length of the axon
However since the axon has multiple terminals it can send the signal to several other cells at once This ensures
that the signal is rapidly propagated to the rest of the body
28 An action potential travels along an axon until it
depolarizes the membrane at an axon terminal Depolarization of the membrane causes voltagegated Ca2 channels
to open and Ca2 to enter the cell The intracellular calcium influx causes synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitter
to fuse with the presynaptic membrane The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors
on the postsynaptic membrane Depending on the specific neurotransmitter and postsynaptic receptor this action
can cause positive excitatory postsynaptic potential or negative inhibitory postsynaptic potential ions to enter the
