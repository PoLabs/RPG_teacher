54  Bulk Transport
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe endocytosis including phagocytosis pinocytosis and receptormediated endocytosis

Understand the process of exocytosis
In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane cells also need to remove and take in
larger molecules and particles see Table 52 for examples Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire
unicellular microorganisms You might have correctly hypothesized that when a cell uptakes and releases large
particles it requires energy A large particle however cannot pass through the membrane even with energy
that the cell supplies
Endocytosis
Endocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles such as large molecules parts of cells and
even whole cells into a cell There are different endocytosis variations but all share a common characteristic
the cells plasma membrane invaginates forming a pocket around the target particle The pocket pinches
off resulting in the particle containing itself in a newly created intracellular vesicle formed from the plasma
membrane
Phagocytosis
Phagocytosis the condition of cell eating is the process by which a cell takes in large particles such as
other cells or relatively large particles For example when microorganisms invade the human body a type of
white blood cell a neutrophil will remove the invaders through this process surrounding and engulfing the
microorganism which the neutrophil then destroys Figure 520
Figure 520 In phagocytosis the cell membrane surrounds the particle and engulfs it credit modification of work by

In preparation for phagocytosis a portion of the plasma membranes inwardfacing surface becomes coated with
the protein clathrin which stabilizes this membranes section The membranes coated portion then extends
from the cells body and surrounds the particle eventually enclosing it Once the vesicle containing the particle
