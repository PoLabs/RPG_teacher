Preventing Habitat Destruction with Wise Wood Choices
Most consumers are not aware that the home improvement products they buy might be contributing to
habitat loss and species extinctions Yet the market for illegally harvested tropical timber is huge and the
wood products often find themselves in building supply stores in the United States One estimate is that 10
percent of the imported timber stream in the United States which is the worlds largest consumer of wood
products is potentially illegally logged In 2006 this amounted to 36 billion in wood products Most of the
illegal products are imported from countries that act as intermediaries and are not the originators of the
wood
How is it possible to determine if a wood product such as flooring was harvested sustainably or even
legally The Forest Stewardship Council FSC certifies sustainably harvested forest products therefore
looking for their certification on flooring and other hardwood products is one way to ensure that the wood
has not been taken illegally from a tropical forest Certification applies to specific products not to a producer
some producers products may not have certification while other products are certified While there are other
industrybacked certifications other than the FSC these are unreliable due to lack of independence from
the industry Another approach is to buy domestic wood species While it would be great if there was a
list of legal versus illegal wood products it is not that simple Logging and forest management laws vary
from country to country what is illegal in one country may be legal in another Where and how a product is
harvested and whether the forest from which it comes is being maintained sustainably all factor into whether
a wood product will be certified by the FSC If you are in doubt it is always a good idea to ask questions
about where a wood product came from and how the supplier knows that it was harvested legally
Habitat destruction can affect ecosystems other than forests Rivers and streams are important ecosystems
that are frequently modified through land development damming channelizing or water removal Damming
affects the water flow to all parts of a river which can reduce or eliminate populations that had adapted to the
natural flow of the river For example an estimated 91 percent of United States rivers have been altered in some
way Modifications include dams to create energy or store water levees to prevent flooding and dredging or
rerouting to create land that is more suitable for human development Many fish and amphibian species and
numerous freshwater clams in the United States have seen declines caused by river damming and habitat loss
Overharvesting
Overharvesting is a serious threat to many species but particularly to aquatic both marine and freshwater
species Despite regulation and monitoring there are recent examples of fishery collapse The western Atlantic
cod fishery is the among the most significant While it was a hugely productive fishery for 400 years the
introduction of modern factory trawlers in the 1980s caused it to become unsustainable Fisheries collapse as
a result of both economic and political factors Fisheries are managed as a shared international resource even
when the fishing territory lies within an individual countrys territorial waters Common resources are subject to
an economic pressure known as the tragedy of the commons in which essentially no fisher has a motivation
to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when it is not owned by that fisher Overexploitation is a common
outcome This overexploitation is exacerbated when access to the fishery is open and unregulated and when
technology gives fishers the ability to overfish In a few fisheries the biological growth of the resource is less than
the potential growth of the profits made from fishing if that time and money were invested elsewhere In these
caseswhales are an exampleeconomic forces will always drive toward fishing the population to extinction
