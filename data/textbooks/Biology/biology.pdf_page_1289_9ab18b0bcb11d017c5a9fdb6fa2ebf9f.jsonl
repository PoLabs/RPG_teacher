Need for Osmoregulation
Biological systems constantly interact and exchange water and nutrients with the environment by way of
consumption of food and water and through excretion in the form of sweat urine and feces Without a
mechanism to regulate osmotic pressure or when a disease damages this mechanism there is a tendency to
accumulate toxic waste and water which can have dire consequences
Mammalian systems have evolved to regulate not only the overall osmotic pressure across membranes but
also specific concentrations of important electrolytes in the three major fluid compartments blood plasma
extracellular fluid and intracellular fluid Since osmotic pressure is regulated by the movement of water across
membranes the volume of the fluid compartments can also change temporarily Because blood plasma is one
of the fluid components osmotic pressures have a direct bearing on blood pressure
Transport of Electrolytes across Cell Membranes
Electrolytes such as sodium chloride ionize in water meaning that they dissociate into their component
ions In water sodium chloride NaCl dissociates into the sodium ion Na and the chloride ion Cl The
most important ions whose concentrations are very closely regulated in body fluids are the cations sodium
Na potassium K calcium Ca2 magnesium Mg2 and the anions chloride Cl carbonate CO32
bicarbonate HCO3 and phosphatePO3 Electrolytes are lost from the body during urination and perspiration
For this reason athletes are encouraged to replace electrolytes and fluids during periods of increased activity
and perspiration
Osmotic pressure is influenced by the concentration of solutes in a solution It is directly proportional to
the number of solute atoms or molecules and not dependent on the size of the solute molecules Because
electrolytes dissociate into their component ions they in essence add more solute particles into the solution
and have a greater effect on osmotic pressure per mass than compounds that do not dissociate in water such
as glucose
Water can pass through membranes by passive diffusion If electrolyte ions could passively diffuse across
membranes it would be impossible to maintain specific concentrations of ions in each fluid compartment
therefore they require special mechanisms to cross the semipermeable membranes in the body This movement
can be accomplished by facilitated diffusion and active transport Facilitated diffusion requires proteinbased
channels for moving the solute Active transport requires energy in the form of ATP conversion carrier proteins
or pumps in order to move ions against the concentration gradient
Concept of Osmolality and Milliequivalent
In order to calculate osmotic pressure it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured
The unit for measuring solutes is the mole One mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute
For example the molecular weight of sodium chloride is 5844 Thus one mole of sodium chloride weighs 5844
grams The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution The molality of a solution
is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent If the solvent is water one kilogram of water is equal
to one liter of water While molarity and molality are used to express the concentration of solutions electrolyte
concentrations are usually expressed in terms of milliequivalents per liter mEqL the mEqL is equal to the ion
concentration in millimoles multiplied by the number of electrical charges on the ion The unit of milliequivalent
takes into consideration the ions present in the solution since electrolytes form ions in aqueous solutions and
the charge on the ions
Thus for ions that have a charge of one one milliequivalent is equal to one millimole For ions that have
a charge of two like calcium one milliequivalent is equal to 05 millimoles Another unit for the expression
of electrolyte concentration is the milliosmole mOsm which is the number of milliequivalents of solute per
kilogram of solvent Body fluids are usually maintained within the range of 280 to 300 mOsm
Osmoregulators and Osmoconformers
Persons lost at sea without any freshwater to drink are at risk of severe dehydration because the human
body cannot adapt to drinking seawater which is hypertonic in comparison to body fluids Organisms such as
goldfish that can tolerate only a relatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as stenohaline About 90
percent of all bony fish are restricted to either freshwater or seawater They are incapable of osmotic regulation
in the opposite environment It is possible however for a few fishes like salmon to spend part of their life
in freshwater and part in seawater Organisms like the salmon and molly that can tolerate a relatively wide
