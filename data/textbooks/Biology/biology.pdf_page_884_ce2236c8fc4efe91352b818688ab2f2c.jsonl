Most lizards differ from snakes by having four limbs although these have often been lost or significantly reduced
in at least 60 lineages Snakes lack eyelids and external ears which are both present in lizards There are
about 6000 species of lizards ranging in size from tiny chameleons and geckos some of which are only a few
centimeters in length to the Komodo dragon which is about 3 meters in length
Some lizards are extravagantly decorated with spines crests and frills and many are brightly colored Some
lizards like chameleons Figure 2929 can change their skin color by redistributing pigment within
chromatophores in their skins Chameleons change color both for camouflage and for social signaling Lizards
have multiplecolored oil droplets in their retinal cells that give them a good range of color vision Lizards
unlike snakes can focus their eyes by changing the shape of the lens The eyes of chameleons can move
independently Several species of lizards have a hidden parietal eye similar to that in the tuatara Both lizards
and snakes use their tongues to sample the environment and a pit in the roof of the mouth Jacobsons organ is
used to evaluate the collected sample
Most lizards are carnivorous but some large species such as iguanas are herbivores Some predatory lizards
are ambush predators waiting quietly until their prey is close enough for a quick grab Others are patient
foragers moving slowly through their environment to detect possible prey Lizard tongues are long and sticky
and can be extended at high speed for capturing insects or other small prey Traditionally the only venomous
lizards are the Gila monster and the beaded lizard However venom glands have also been identified in several
species of monitors and iguanids but the venom is not injected directly and should probably be regarded as a
toxin delivered with the bite
Specialized features of the jaw are related to adaptations for feeding that have evolved to feed on relatively large
prey even though some current species have reversed this trend Snakes are thought to have descended from
either burrowing or aquatic lizards over 100 million years ago Figure 2930 They include about 3600 species
ranging in size from 10 centimeterlong thread snakes to 10 meterlong pythons and anacondas All snakes
are legless except for boids eg boa constrictors which have vestigial hindlimbs in the form of pelvic spurs
Like caecilian amphibians the narrow bodies of most snakes have only a single functional lung All snakes are
carnivorous and eat small animals birds eggs fish and insects
