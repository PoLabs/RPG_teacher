Figure 3032 In this example with a semipermeable membrane between two aqueous systems water will move
from a region of higher to lower water potential until equilibrium is reached Solutes s pressure p and
gravity g influence total water potential for each side of the tube totalright or left and therefore the difference
between total on each side  m  the potential due to interaction of water with solid substrates is ignored
in this example because glass is not especially hydrophilic Water moves in response to the difference in water
potential between two systems the left and right sides of the tube
Positive water potential is placed on the left side of the tube by increasing p such that the water level rises
on the right side Could you equalize the water level on each side of the tube by adding solute and if so
how
Pressure Potential
Pressure potential p also called turgor potential may be positive or negative Figure 3032 Because
pressure is an expression of energy the higher the pressure the more potential energy in a system and vice
versa Therefore a positive p compression increases total and a negative p tension decreases total
Positive pressure inside cells is contained by the cell wall producing turgor pressure Pressure potentials are
typically around 0608 MPa but can reach as high as 15 MPa in a wellwatered plant A p of 15 MPa
equates to 210 pounds per square inch 15 MPa x 140 lb in2 MPa1  210 lbin2 As a comparison most
automobile tires are kept at a pressure of 3034 psi An example of the effect of turgor pressure is the wilting of
leaves and their restoration after the plant has been watered Figure 3033 Water is lost from the leaves via
transpiration approaching p  0 MPa at the wilting point and restored by uptake via the roots
A plant can manipulate p via its ability to manipulate s and by the process of osmosis If a plant cell
increases the cytoplasmic solute concentration s will decline total will decline the  between the cell and
