dopamine receptors and decreasing dopamine neurotransmission in the brain This decrease in dopamine can
cause Parkinsons diseaselike symptoms in some patients While some classes of antipsychotics can be quite
effective at treating the disease they are not a cure and most patients must remain medicated for the rest of
their lives
Depression
Major depression affects approximately 67 percent of the adults in the United States each year and is one
of the most common mental disorders To be diagnosed with major depressive disorder a person must have
experienced a severely depressed mood lasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including
a loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously enjoyed changes in appetite and sleep schedules
difficulty concentrating feelings of worthlessness and suicidal thoughts The exact causes of major depression
are unknown and likely include both genetic and environmental risk factors Some research supports the
classic monoamine hypothesis which suggests that depression is caused by a decrease in norepinephrine
and serotonin neurotransmission One argument against this hypothesis is the fact that some antidepressant
medications cause an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin release within a few hours of beginning
treatmentbut clinical results of these medications are not seen until weeks later This has led to alternative
hypotheses for example dopamine may also be decreased in depressed patients or it may actually be
an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin that causes the disease and antidepressants force a feedback
loop that decreases this release Treatments for depression include psychotherapy electroconvulsive therapy
deepbrain stimulation and prescription medications There are several classes of antidepressant medications
that work through different mechanisms For example monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAO inhibitors block
the enzyme that degrades many neurotransmitters including dopamine serotonin norepinephrine resulting
in increased neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs block the
reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron This blockage results in an increase in serotonin in the
synaptic cleft Other types of drugs such as norepinephrinedopamine reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also used to treat depression
Other Neurological Disorders
There are several other neurological disorders that cannot be easily placed in the above categories These
include chronic pain conditions cancers of the nervous system epilepsy disorders and stroke Epilepsy and
stroke are discussed below
Epilepsy
Estimates suggest that up to three percent of people in the United States will be diagnosed with epilepsy in their
lifetime While there are several different types of epilepsy all are characterized by recurrent seizures Epilepsy
itself can be a symptom of a brain injury disease or other illness For example people who have intellectual
disability or ASD can experience seizures presumably because the developmental wiring malfunctions that
caused their disorders also put them at risk for epilepsy For many patients however the cause of their epilepsy
is never identified and is likely to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors Often seizures can be
controlled with anticonvulsant medications However for very severe cases patients may undergo brain surgery
to remove the brain area where seizures originate
Stroke
A stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage Without
the oxygen supplied by blood flow neurons in this brain region die This neuronal death can cause many different
symptomsdepending on the brain area affected including headache muscle weakness or paralysis speech
disturbances sensory problems memory loss and confusion Stroke is often caused by blood clots and can
also be caused by the bursting of a weak blood vessel Strokes are extremely common and are the third most
common cause of death in the United States On average one person experiences a stroke every 40 seconds
in the United States Approximately 75 percent of strokes occur in people older than 65 Risk factors for stroke
include high blood pressure diabetes high cholesterol and a family history of stroke Smoking doubles the risk
of stroke Because a stroke is a medical emergency patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go
to the emergency room where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed These
drugs will not work if the stroke was caused by a burst blood vessel or if the stroke occurred more than three
hours before arriving at the hospital Treatment following a stroke can include blood pressure medication to
prevent future strokes and sometimes intense physical therapy
