obtained from the diet are actively transported into follicle cells resulting in a concentration that is approximately
30 times higher than in blood The typical diet in North America provides more iodine than required due to the
addition of iodide to table salt Inadequate iodine intake which occurs in many developing countries results in
an inability to synthesize T3 and T4 hormones The thyroid gland enlarges in a condition called goiter which is
caused by overproduction of TSH without the formation of thyroid hormone Thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid
called colloid and TSH stimulation results in higher levels of colloid accumulation in the thyroid In the absence
of iodine this is not converted to thyroid hormone and colloid begins to accumulate more and more in the thyroid
gland leading to goiter
Disorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones Hypothyroidism
underproduction of the thyroid hormones can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain sensitivity
to cold and reduced mental activity among other symptoms In children hypothyroidism can cause cretinism
which can lead to mental retardation and growth defects Hyperthyroidism the overproduction of thyroid
hormones can lead to an increased metabolic rate and its effects weight loss excess heat production
sweating and an increased heart rate Graves disease is one example of a hyperthyroid condition
Hormonal Control of Blood Calcium Levels
Regulation of blood calcium concentrations is important for generation of muscle contractions and nerve
impulses which are electrically stimulated If calcium levels get too high membrane permeability to sodium
decreases and membranes become less responsive If calcium levels get too low membrane permeability to
sodium increases and convulsions or muscle spasms can result
Blood calcium levels are regulated by parathyroid hormone PTH which is produced by the parathyroid
glands as illustrated in Figure 3712 PTH is released in response to low blood Ca2 levels PTH increases
Ca2 levels by targeting the skeleton the kidneys and the intestine In the skeleton PTH stimulates osteoclasts
which causes bone to be reabsorbed releasing Ca2 from bone into the blood PTH also inhibits osteoblasts
reducing Ca2 deposition in bone In the intestines PTH increases dietary Ca2 absorption and in the kidneys
PTH stimulates reabsorption of the CA2 While PTH acts directly on the kidneys to increase Ca2 reabsorption
its effects on the intestine are indirect PTH triggers the formation of calcitriol an active form of vitamin D which
acts on the intestines to increase absorption of dietary calcium PTH release is inhibited by rising blood calcium
levels
