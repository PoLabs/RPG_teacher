a ratio that is similar to that seen in modern gorillas and orangutans In contrast modern human males are
approximately 15 to 20 percent larger than females The brain size of Australopithecus relative to its body mass
was also smaller than in modern humans and more similar to that seen in the great apes A key feature that
Australopithecus had in common with modern humans was bipedalism although it is likely that Australopithecus
also spent time in trees Hominin footprints similar to those of modern humans were found in Laetoli Tanzania
and dated to 36 million years ago They showed that hominins at the time of Australopithecus were walking
upright
There were a number of Australopithecus species which are often referred to as australopiths Australopithecus
anamensis lived about 42 million years ago More is known about another early species Australopithecus
afarensis which lived between 39 and 29 million years ago This species demonstrates a trend in human
evolution the reduction of the dentition and jaw in size A afarensis Figure 2947a had smaller canines and
molars compared to apes but these were larger than those of modern humans Its brain size was 380 to 450
cubic centimeters approximately the size of a modern chimpanzee brain It also had prognathic jaws which is
a relatively longer jaw than that of modern humans In the mid1970s the fossil of an adult female A afarensis
was found in the Afar region of Ethiopia and dated to 324 million years ago Figure 2948 The fossil which is
informally called Lucy is significant because it was the most complete australopith fossil found with 40 percent
of the skeleton recovered
Figure 2947 Australopithicene and modern human skulls The skull of a Australopithecus afarensis an early hominid
that lived between two and three million years ago resembled that of b modern humans but was smaller with a sloped
forehead larger teeth and a prominent jaw
