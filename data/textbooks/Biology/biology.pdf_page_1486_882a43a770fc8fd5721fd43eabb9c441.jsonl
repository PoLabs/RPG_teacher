Figure 4615 Carbon dioxide gas exists in the atmosphere and is dissolved in water Photosynthesis converts carbon
dioxide gas to organic carbon and respiration cycles the organic carbon back into carbon dioxide gas Longterm
storage of organic carbon occurs when matter from living organisms is buried deep underground and becomes
fossilized Volcanic activity and more recently human emissions bring this stored carbon back into the carbon cycle

The Biological Carbon Cycle
Living organisms are connected in many ways even between ecosystems A good example of this connection
is the exchange of carbon between autotrophs and heterotrophs within and between ecosystems by way of
atmospheric carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is the basic building block that most autotrophs use to build
multicarbon high energy compounds such as glucose The energy harnessed from the sun is used by these
organisms to form the covalent bonds that link carbon atoms together These chemical bonds thereby store this
energy for later use in the process of respiration Most terrestrial autotrophs obtain their carbon dioxide directly
from the atmosphere while marine autotrophs acquire it in the dissolved form carbonic acid H2CO3 However
carbon dioxide is acquired a byproduct of the process is oxygen The photosynthetic organisms are responsible
for depositing approximately 21 percent oxygen content of the atmosphere that we observe today
Heterotrophs and autotrophs are partners in biological carbon exchange especially the primary consumers
largely herbivores Heterotrophs acquire the highenergy carbon compounds from the autotrophs by consuming
them and breaking them down by respiration to obtain cellular energy such as ATP The most efficient type of
respiration aerobic respiration requires oxygen obtained from the atmosphere or dissolved in water Thus there
is a constant exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the autotrophs which need the carbon and the
heterotrophs which need the oxygen Gas exchange through the atmosphere and water is one way that the
carbon cycle connects all living organisms on Earth
