Antibiotics Are We Facing a Crisis
The word antibiotic comes from the Greek anti meaning against and bios meaning life An antibiotic is
a chemical produced either by microbes or synthetically that is hostile to or prevents the growth of other
organisms Todays media often address concerns about an antibiotic crisis Are the antibiotics that easily treated
bacterial infections in the past becoming obsolete Are there new superbugsbacteria that have evolved to
become more resistant to our arsenal of antibiotics Is this the beginning of the end of antibiotics All these
questions challenge the healthcare community
One of the main causes of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is overexposure to antibiotics The imprudent and
excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in the natural selection of resistant forms of bacteria The antibiotic kills
most of the infecting bacteria and therefore only the resistant forms remain These resistant forms reproduce
resulting in an increase in the proportion of resistant forms over nonresistant ones In addition to transmission
of resistance genes to progeny lateral transfer of resistance genes on plasmids can rapidly spread these genes
through a bacterial population A major misuse of antibiotics is in patients with viral infections like colds or the
flu against which antibiotics are useless Another problem is the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock The
routine use of antibiotics in animal feed promotes bacterial resistance as well In the United States 70 percent of
the antibiotics produced are fed to animals These antibiotics are given to livestock in low doses which maximize
the probability of resistance developing and these resistant bacteria are readily transferred to humans

One of the Superbugs MRSA
The imprudent use of antibiotics has paved the way for the expansion of resistant bacterial populations For
example Staphylococcus aureus often called staph is a common bacterium that can live in the human
body and is usually easily treated with antibiotics However a very dangerous strain methicillinresistant
Staphylococcus aureus MRSA has made the news over the past few years Figure 2225 This strain is
resistant to many commonly used antibiotics including methicillin amoxicillin penicillin and oxacillin MRSA
can cause infections of the skin but it can also infect the bloodstream lungs urinary tract or sites of injury
While MRSA infections are common among people in healthcare facilities they have also appeared in healthy
people who havent been hospitalized but who live or work in tight populations like military personnel and
prisoners Researchers have expressed concern about the way this latter source of MRSA targets a much
younger population than those residing in care facilities The Journal of the American Medical Association
reported that among MRSAafflicted persons in healthcare facilities the average age is 68 whereas people with
communityassociated MRSA  CAMRSA have an average age of 234
