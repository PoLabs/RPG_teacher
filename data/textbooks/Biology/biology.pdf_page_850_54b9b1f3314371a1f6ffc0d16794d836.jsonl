around the cloaca pump water in and out of these trees There are clusters of tentacles around the mouth
Some sea cucumbers feed on detritus while others are suspension feeders sifting out small organisms with
their oral tentacles Some species of sea cucumbers are unique among the echinoderms in that cells containing
hemoglobin circulate in the coelomic fluid the water vascular system andor the hemal system

Phylum Chordata
Animals in the phylum Chordata share five key features that appear at some stage of their development
a notochord a dorsal hollow nerve cord pharyngeal slits a postanal tail and an endostylethyroid gland
that secretes iodinated hormones In some groups some of these traits are present only during embryonic
development In addition to containing vertebrate classes the phylum Chordata contains two clades of
invertebrates Urochordata tunicates salps and larvaceans and Cephalochordata lancelets Most tunicates
live on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders Lancelets are suspension feeders that feed on phytoplankton
and other microorganisms The invertebrate chordates will be discussed more extensively in the following
