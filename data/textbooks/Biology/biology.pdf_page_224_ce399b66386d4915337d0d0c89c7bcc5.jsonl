75  Metabolism without Oxygen
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the fundamental difference between anaerobic cellular respiration and fermentation

Describe the type of fermentation that readily occurs in animal cells and the conditions that initiate that
fermentation
In aerobic respiration the final electron acceptor is an oxygen molecule O2 If aerobic respiration occurs then
ATP will be produced using the energy of highenergy electrons carried by NADH or FADH2 to the electron
transport chain If aerobic respiration does not occur NADH must be reoxidized to NAD for reuse as an electron
carrier for the glycolytic pathway to continue How is this done Some living systems use an organic molecule
as the final electron acceptor Processes that use an organic molecule to regenerate NAD from NADH are
collectively referred to as fermentation In contrast some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final
electron acceptor Both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration in which organisms convert energy
for their use in the absence of oxygen
Anaerobic Cellular Respiration
Certain prokaryotes including some species in the domains Bacteria and Archaea use anaerobic respiration
For example a group of archaeans called methanogens reduces carbon dioxide to methane to oxidize NADH
These microorganisms are found in soil and in the digestive tracts of ruminants such as cows and sheep
Similarly sulfatereducing bacteria most of which are anaerobic Figure 713 reduce sulfate to hydrogen
sulfide to regenerate NAD from NADH
Figure 713 The green color seen in these coastal waters is from an eruption of hydrogen sulfideproducing bacteria
These anaerobic sulfatereducing bacteria release hydrogen sulfide gas as they decompose algae in the water
