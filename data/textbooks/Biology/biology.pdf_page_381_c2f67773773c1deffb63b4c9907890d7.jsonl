Sex Chromosome Nondisjunction in Humans
Humans display dramatic deleterious effects with autosomal trisomies and monosomies Therefore it may seem
counterintuitive that human females and males can function normally despite carrying different numbers of the
X chromosome Rather than a gain or loss of autosomes variations in the number of sex chromosomes occur
with relatively mild effects In part this happens because of the molecular process X inactivation Early in
development when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells relative to trillions in the
newborn one X chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent dormant structure
or a Barr body The chance that an X chromosome maternally or paternally derived inactivates in each cell
is random but once this occurs all cells derived from that one will have the same inactive X chromosome or
Barr body By this process females compensate for their double genetic dose of X chromosome In socalled
tortoiseshell cats we observe embryonic X inactivation as color variegation Figure 139 Females that are
heterozygous for an Xlinked coat color gene will express one of two different coat colors over different regions
of their body corresponding to whichever X chromosome inactivates in that regions embryonic cell progenitor
Figure 139 In cats the gene for coat color is located on the X chromosome In female cats embryonic development
one of the two X chromosomes randomly inactivates in each cell resulting in a tortoiseshell pattern if the cat has
two different alleles for coat color Male cats having only one X chromosome never exhibit a tortoiseshell coat color

An individual carrying an abnormal number of X chromosomes will inactivate all but one X chromosome in each
of her cells However even inactivated X chromosomes continue to express a few genes and X chromosomes
must reactivate for the proper maturation of female ovaries As a result Xchromosomal abnormalities typically
occur with mild mental and physical defects as well as sterility If the X chromosome is absent altogether the
