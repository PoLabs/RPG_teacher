Table 453
Calculate the mortality rate for each age interval and
describe the trends in adult and childhood mortality
per 100000 births in the United States in 2013
32 Why is longterm parental care not associated
with having many offspring during a reproductive
episode
33 Describe the difference in evolutionary pressures
experienced by an animal that begins reproducing
early and an animal that reproduces late in its
lifecycle
34 Describe the rate of population growth that would
be expected at various parts of the Sshaped curve
of logistic growth
35 Describe how the population of a species that
survives a mass extinction event would change in
size and growth pattern over time beginning
immediately after the extinction event
36 Give an example of how densitydependent and
densityindependent factors might interact
37 Describe the age structures in rapidly growing
countries slowly growing countries and countries
with zero population growth
38 Since the introduction of the Endangered Species
Act the number of species on the protected list has
more than doubled Describe how the human
populations growth pattern contributes to the rise in
endangered species
39 Describe the competitive exclusion principle and
its effects on competing species
40 Jaguars are a keystone species in the Amazon
Describe how they can be so essential to the
ecosystem despite being significantly less abundant
than many other species
41 Describe Pavlovs dog experiments as an
example of classical conditioning
42 Describe the advantage of using an aural or
pheromone signal to attract a mate as opposed to a
visual signal How might the population density
contribute to the evolution of aural or visual mating
rituals
