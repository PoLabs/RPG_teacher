Eukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes Eukaryotes also
have a number of different linear chromosomes The human genome has 3 billion base pairs per haploid set of
chromosomes and 6 billion base pairs are replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle There are multiple
origins of replication on each eukaryotic chromosome humans can have up to 100000 origins of replication
across the genome The rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per second much slower than
prokaryotic replication In yeast which is a eukaryote special sequences known as autonomously replicating
sequences ARS are found on the chromosomes These are equivalent to the origin of replication in E coli
The number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than in prokaryotes 14 are known of which five
are known to have major roles during replication and have been well studied They are known as pol  pol 
pol  pol  and pol 
The essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes Before replication can start the DNA has to be
made available as a template Eukaryotic DNA is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form structures
called nucleosomes Histones must be removed and then replaced during the replication process which helps
to account for the lower replication rate in eukaryotes The chromatin the complex between DNA and proteins
may undergo some chemical modifications so that the DNA may be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible
to the enzymes of the DNA replication machinery At the origin of replication a prereplication complex is made
with other initiator proteins Helicase and other proteins are then recruited to start the replication process Table

A helicase using the energy from ATP hydrolysis opens up the DNA helix Replication forks are formed at each
replication origin as the DNA unwinds The opening of the double helix causes overwinding or supercoiling in
the DNA ahead of the replication fork These are resolved with the action of topoisomerases Primers are formed
by the enzyme primase and using the primer DNA pol can start synthesis Three major DNA polymerases are
then involved   and  DNA pol  adds a short 20 to 30 nucleotides DNA fragment to the RNA primer on both
strands and then hands off to a second polymerase While the leading strand is continuously synthesized by the
enzyme pol  the lagging strand is synthesized by pol  A sliding clamp protein known as PCNA proliferating
cell nuclear antigen holds the DNA pol in place so that it does not slide off the DNA As pol  runs into the primer
RNA on the lagging strand it displaces it from the DNA template The displaced primer RNA is then removed by
RNase H AKA flap endonuclease and replaced with DNA nucleotides The Okazaki fragments in the lagging
strand are joined after the replacement of the RNA primers with DNA The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA
ligase which forms the phosphodiester bond
Telomere replication
Unlike prokaryotic chromosomes eukaryotic chromosomes are linear As youve learned the enzyme DNA pol
can add nucleotides only in the 5 to 3 direction In the leading strand synthesis continues until the end of the
chromosome is reached On the lagging strand DNA is synthesized in short stretches each of which is initiated
by a separate primer When the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome there is no way to
replace the primer on the 5 end of the lagging strand The DNA at the ends of the chromosome thus remains
unpaired and over time these ends called telomeres may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide
