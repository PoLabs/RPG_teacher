Endocrinologist
An endocrinologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the endocrine glands
hormone systems and glucose and lipid metabolic pathways An endocrine surgeon specializes in the
surgical treatment of endocrine diseases and glands Some of the diseases that are managed by
endocrinologists disorders of the pancreas diabetes mellitus disorders of the pituitary gigantism
acromegaly and pituitary dwarfism disorders of the thyroid gland goiter and Graves disease and
disorders of the adrenal glands Cushings disease and Addisons disease
Endocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through extensive use of
laboratory tests Many endocrine diseases are diagnosed using tests that stimulate or suppress endocrine
organ functioning Blood samples are then drawn to determine the effect of stimulating or suppressing an
endocrine organ on the production of hormones For example to diagnose diabetes mellitus patients are
required to fast for 12 to 24 hours They are then given a sugary drink which stimulates the pancreas to
produce insulin to decrease blood glucose levels A blood sample is taken one to two hours after the sugar
drink is consumed If the pancreas is functioning properly the blood glucose level will be within a normal
range Another example is the A1C test which can be performed during blood screening The A1C test
measures average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months by examining how well the blood
glucose is being managed over a long time
Once a disease has been diagnosed endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes andor medications
to treat the disease Some cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise weight loss and a
healthy diet in other cases medications may be required to enhance insulin release If the disease cannot
be controlled by these means the endocrinologist may prescribe insulin injections
In addition to clinical practice endocrinologists may also be involved in primary research and development
activities For example ongoing islet transplant research is investigating how healthy pancreas islet cells
may be transplanted into diabetic patients Successful islet transplants may allow patients to stop taking
insulin injections
372  How Hormones Work
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how hormones work

Discuss the role of different types of hormone receptors
Hormones mediate changes in target cells by binding to specific hormone receptors In this way even though
hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types they only affect
cells that possess the necessary receptors Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on many different
cells or may be limited to a small number of specialized cells For example thyroid hormones act on many
different tissue types stimulating metabolic activity throughout the body Cells can have many receptors for the
same hormone but often also possess receptors for different types of hormones The number of receptors that
respond to a hormone determines the cells sensitivity to that hormone and the resulting cellular response
Additionally the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time resulting in increased or
decreased cell sensitivity In upregulation the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone
levels making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity When the number of
receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels called downregulation cellular activity is reduced
Receptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes
Depending on the location of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone
hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and modulating gene
transcription or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways
