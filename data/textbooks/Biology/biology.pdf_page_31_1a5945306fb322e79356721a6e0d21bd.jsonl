Reproduction
Singlecelled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares
to divide to form two new cells Multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive germline gamete
oocyte and sperm cells After fertilization the fusion of an oocyte and a sperm cell a new individual develops
When reproduction occurs DNA containing genes are passed along to an organisms offspring These genes
ensure that the offspring will belong to the same species and will have similar characteristics such as size and
shape
Growth and Development
Organisms grow and develop as a result of genes providing specific instructions that will direct cellular growth
and development This ensures that a species young Figure 112 will grow up to exhibit many of the same
characteristics as its parents

same characteristics credit Rocky Mountain Feline Rescue
Regulation
Even the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal
functions respond to stimuli and cope with environmental stresses Two examples of internal functions
regulated in an organism are nutrient transport and blood flow Organs groups of tissues working together
perform specific functions such as carrying oxygen throughout the body removing wastes delivering nutrients
to every cell and cooling the body
Homeostasis

temperature by generating heat and reducing heat loss through thick fur and a dense layer of fat under their skin

In order to function properly cells require appropriate conditions such as proper temperature pH and
appropriate concentration of diverse chemicals These conditions may however change from one moment to
the next Organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly despite
