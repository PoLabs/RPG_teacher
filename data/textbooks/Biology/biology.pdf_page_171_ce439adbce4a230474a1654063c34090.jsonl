hydrogen and potassium ions Both of these are antiporter carrier proteins Two other carrier proteins are Ca2
ATPase and H ATPase which carry only calcium and only hydrogen ions respectively Both are pumps
Figure 517 A uniporter carries one molecule or ion A symporter carries two different molecules or ions both in the
same direction An antiporter also carries two different molecules or ions but in different directions credit modification

Primary Active Transport
The primary active transport that functions with the active transport of sodium and potassium allows secondary
active transport to occur The second transport method is still active because it depends on using energy as
does primary transport Figure 518

electrogenic transport credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal
One of the most important pumps in animal cells is the sodiumpotassium pump NaK ATPase which
maintains the electrochemical gradient and the correct concentrations of Na and K in living cells The sodium
potassium pump moves K into the cell while moving Na out at the same time at a ratio of three Na for every
two K ions moved in The NaK ATPase exists in two forms depending on its orientation to the cells interior
or exterior and its affinity for either sodium or potassium ions The process consists of the following six steps
1
With the enzyme oriented towards the cells interior the carrier has a high affinity for sodium ions Three
ions bind to the protein
2
The protein carrier hydrolyzes ATP and a lowenergy phosphate group attaches to it
3
As a result the carrier changes shape and reorients itself towards the membranes exterior The proteins
affinity for sodium decreases and the three sodium ions leave the carrier
4
The shape change increases the carriers affinity for potassium ions and two such ions attach to the protein
Subsequently the lowenergy phosphate group detaches from the carrier
5
With the phosphate group removed and potassium ions attached the carrier protein repositions itself
towards the cells interior
6
The carrier protein in its new configuration has a decreased affinity for potassium and the two ions moves
