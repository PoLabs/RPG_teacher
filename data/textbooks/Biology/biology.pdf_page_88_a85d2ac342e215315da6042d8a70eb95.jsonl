Figure 310 In cellulose glucose monomers are linked in unbranched chains by  14 glycosidic linkages Because of
the way the glucose subunits are joined every glucose monomer is flipped relative to the next one resulting in a linear
fibrous structure
As Figure 310 shows every other glucose monomer in cellulose is flipped over and the monomers are packed
tightly as extended long chains This gives cellulose its rigidity and high tensile strengthwhich is so important
to plant cells While human digestive enzymes cannot break down the  14 linkage herbivores such as cows
koalas and buffalos are able with the help of the specialized flora in their stomach to digest plant material that
is rich in cellulose and use it as a food source In some of these animals certain species of bacteria and protists
reside in the rumen part of the herbivores digestive system and secrete the enzyme cellulase The appendix
of grazing animals also contains bacteria that digest cellulose giving it an important role in ruminants digestive
systems Cellulases can break down cellulose into glucose monomers that animals use as an energy source
Termites are also able to break down cellulose because of the presence of other organisms in their bodies that
secrete cellulases
Carbohydrates serve various functions in different animals Arthropods insects crustaceans and others have
an outer skeleton the exoskeleton which protects their internal body parts as we see in the bee in Figure
311 This exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule chitin which is a polysaccharidecontaining
nitrogen It is made of repeating Nacetyldglucosamine units which are a modified sugar Chitin is also a
major component of fungal cell walls Fungi are neither animals nor plants and form a kingdom of their own in
the domain Eukarya
