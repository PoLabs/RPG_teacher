KEY TERMS
modification added to the 5 end of premRNAs to protect mRNA from degradation and
assist translation
enzyme that charges tRNA molecules by catalyzing a bond between the tRNA
and a corresponding amino acid
threenucleotide sequence in a tRNA molecule that corresponds to an mRNA codon
GGCCAATCT essential eukaryotic promoter sequence involved in binding transcription factors
states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs which in turn specify the sequence of
proteins
three consecutive nucleotides in mRNA that specify the insertion of an amino acid or the release of a
polypeptide chain during translation
in terms of RNA and protein three units of RNA nucleotides specify one unit of protein amino
acid in a consecutive fashion
DNA sequence that is used by many species to perform the same or similar functions
prokaryotic RNA polymerase consisting of    and  but missing  this complex performs
elongation
of the genetic code describes that a given amino acid can be encoded by more than one
nucleotide triplet the code is degenerate but not ambiguous
nucleotides following the initiation site in the direction of mRNA transcription in general
sequences that are toward the 3 end relative to a site on the mRNA
sequence present in proteincoding mRNA after completion of premRNA splicing
complex that facilitates chromatin transcription by disassembling nucleosomes ahead of a transcribing
RNA polymerase II and reassembling them after the polymerase passes by
GGCG nonessential eukaryotic promoter sequence that binds cellular factors to increase the
efficiency of transcription may be present several times in a promoter
structure of RNA when it folds back on itself and forms intramolecular hydrogen bonds between
complementary nucleotides
prokaryotic RNA polymerase consisting of     and  this complex is responsible for
transcription initiation
nucleotide from which mRNA synthesis proceeds in the 5 to 3 direction denoted with a 1
in prokaryotes called tRNA f
Met  in eukaryotes called tRNAi a tRNA that interacts with a start
codon binds directly to the ribosome P site and links to a special methionine to begin a polypeptide chain
nonproteincoding intervening sequences that are spliced from mRNA during processing
determines the correct initiation AUG in a eukaryotic mRNA the following consensus sequence
must appear around the AUG 5GCCpurineCCAUGG3 the bolded bases are most important
one of the three mRNA codons that specifies termination of translation
strand of DNA that is not used to transcribe mRNA this strand is identical to the mRNA
except that T nucleotides in the DNA are replaced by U nucleotides in the mRNA
ATTTGCAT nonessential eukaryotic promoter sequence that binds cellular factors to increase
