61  Energy and Metabolism
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain metabolic pathways and describe the two major types

Discuss how chemical reactions play a role in energy transfer
Scientists use the term bioenergetics to discuss the concept of energy flow Figure 62 through living systems
such as cells Cellular processes such as building and breaking down complex molecules occur through
stepwise chemical reactions Some of these chemical reactions are spontaneous and release energy whereas
others require energy to proceed Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish what they
have used cells must continually produce more energy to replenish that which the many energyrequiring
chemical reactions that constantly take place use All of the chemical reactions that transpire inside cells
including those that use and release energy are the cells metabolism
Figure 62 Most life forms on earth obtain their energy from the sun Plants use photosynthesis to capture sunlight
and herbivores eat those plants to obtain energy Carnivores eat the herbivores and decomposers digest plant and
animal matter
Carbohydrate Metabolism
Sugar chemical reactions metabolism a simple carbohydrate is a classic example of the many cellular
processes that use and produce energy Living things consume sugar as a major energy source because sugar
molecules have considerable energy stored within their bonds The following equation describes the breakdown
of glucose a simple sugar
C6 H12 O6  6O2 6CO2  6H2 O  energy
Consumed carbohydrates have their origins in photosynthesizing organisms like plants Figure 63 During
photosynthesis plants use the energy of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide gas CO2 into sugar molecules like
