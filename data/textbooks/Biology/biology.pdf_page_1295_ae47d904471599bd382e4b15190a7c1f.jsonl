Kidney Function and Physiology
Kidneys filter blood in a threestep process First the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network
in the glomerulus Almost all solutes except for proteins are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called
glomerular filtration Second the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules Most of the solutes get reabsorbed
in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption In the loop of Henle the filtrate continues to exchange
solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network Water is also reabsorbed during
this step Then additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion
which is in essence the opposite process to tubular reabsorption The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming
from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae From here the papillae deliver the filtrate now called
urine into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the renal pelvis This entire process
is illustrated in Figure 417
