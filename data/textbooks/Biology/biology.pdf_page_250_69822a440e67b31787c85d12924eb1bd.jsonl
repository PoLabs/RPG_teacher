The Calvin Cycle
In plants carbon dioxide CO2 enters the leaves through stomata where it diffuses over short distances through
intercellular spaces until it reaches the mesophyll cells Once in the mesophyll cells CO2 diffuses into the stroma
of the chloroplastthe site of lightindependent reactions of photosynthesis These reactions actually have
several names associated with them Another term the Calvin cycle is named for the man who discovered
it and because these reactions function as a cycle Others call it the CalvinBenson cycle to include the name
of another scientist involved in its discovery The most outdated name is dark reaction because light is not
directly required Figure 817 However the term dark reaction can be misleading because it implies incorrectly
that the reaction only occurs at night or is independent of light which is why most scientists and instructors no
longer use it
Figure 817 Light reactions harness energy from the sun to produce chemical bonds ATP and NADPH These energy
carrying molecules are made in the stroma where carbon fixation takes place
The lightindependent reactions of the Calvin cycle can be organized into three basic stages fixation reduction
and regeneration
Stage 1 Fixation
In the stroma in addition to CO2 two other components are present to initiate the lightindependent reactions an
enzyme called ribulose15bisphosphate carboxylaseoxygenase RuBisCO and three molecules of ribulose
bisphosphate RuBP as shown in Figure 818 RuBP has five atoms of carbon flanked by two phosphates
