The mouth of a sea anemone is surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes The slitlike mouth opening
and flattened pharynx are lined with ectoderm This structure of the pharynx makes anemones bilaterally
symmetrical A ciliated groove called a siphonoglyph is found on two opposite sides of the pharynx and directs
water into it The pharynx is the muscular part of the digestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food
and may extend for up to twothirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity This
cavity is divided into several chambers by longitudinal septa called mesenteries Each mesentery consists of a
fold of gastrodermal tissue with a layer of mesoglea between the sheets of gastrodermis Mesenteries do not
divide the gastrovascular cavity completely and the smaller cavities coalesce at the pharyngeal opening The
adaptive benefit of the mesenteries appears to be an increase in surface area for absorption of nutrients and gas
exchange as well as additional mechanical support for the body of the anemone
Sea anemones feed on small fish and shrimp usually by immobilizing their prey with nematocysts Some sea
anemones establish a mutualistic relationship with hermit crabs when the crab seizes and attaches them to their
shell In this relationship the anemone gets food particles from prey caught by the crab and the crab is protected
from the predators by the stinging cells of the anemone Some species of anemone fish or clownfish are also
able to live with sea anemones because they build up an acquired immunity to the toxins contained within the
nematocysts and also secrete a protective mucus that prevents them from being stung
The structure of coral polyps is similar to that of anemones although the individual polyps are usually smaller
and part of a colony some of which are massive and the size of small buildings Coral polyps feed on smaller
planktonic organisms including algae bacteria and invertebrate larvae Some anthozoans have symbiotic
associations with dinoflagellate algae called zooxanthellae The mutually beneficial relationship between
zooxanthellae and modern coralswhich provides the algae with sheltergives coral reefs their colors and
supplies both organisms with nutrients This complex mutualistic association began more than 210 million years
ago according to a new study by an international team of scientists That this symbiotic relationship arose during
a time of massive worldwide coralreef expansion suggests that the interconnection of algae and coral is crucial
for the health of coral reefs which provide habitat for roughly onefourth of all marine life Reefs are threatened
by a trend in ocean warming that has caused corals to expel their zooxanthellae algae and turn white a process
called coral bleaching
Anthozoans remain polypoid note that this term is easily confused with polyploid throughout their lives
