Figure 153 Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA Ribosomes are able to read the genetic
information inscribed on a strand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a
protein
The Genetic Code Is Degenerate and Universal
Each amino acid is defined by a threenucleotide sequence called the triplet codon Given the different numbers
of letters in the mRNA and protein alphabets scientists theorized that single amino acids must be represented
by combinations of nucleotides Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid because
there are only 16 possible twonucleotide combinations 42 In contrast there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets
