continues to birth and some systems such as the nervous system and liver continue to develop after birth
The mother will be at her most uncomfortable during this trimester She may urinate frequently due to pressure
on the bladder from the fetus There may also be intestinal blockage and circulatory problems especially in her
legs Clots may form in her legs due to pressure from the fetus on returning veins as they enter the abdominal
cavity

Labor and Birth
Labor is the physical efforts of expulsion of the fetus and the placenta from the uterus during birth parturition
Toward the end of the third trimester estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the
hormone oxytocin At this time the baby reorients facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head
engaging the cervix uterine opening This causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the
hypothalamus which signals for the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary The oxytocin causes the
smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract At the same time the placenta releases prostaglandins into the
uterus increasing the contractions A positive feedback relay occurs between the uterus hypothalamus and
the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin As more smooth muscle cells are recruited the
contractions increase in intensity and force
There are three stages to labor During stage one the cervix thins and dilates This is necessary for the baby
and placenta to be expelled during birth The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm During stage two the
baby is expelled from the uterus The uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal
muscles to aid the delivery The last stage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has been born and
the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine wall If labor should stop before stage two is reached
synthetic oxytocin known as Pitocin can be administered to restart and maintain labor
An alternative to labor and delivery is the surgical delivery of the baby through a procedure called a Caesarian
section This is major abdominal surgery and can lead to postsurgical complications for the mother but in some
