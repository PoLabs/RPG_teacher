or speculation about something meaning that the knowledge implied by the theory is very weak 21 Organisms of
one species can arrive to an island together and then disperse throughout the chain each settling into different niches
and exploiting different food resources to reduce competition 23 The formation of gametes with new n numbers can
occur in one generation After a couple of generations enough of these new hybrids can form to reproduce together
as a new species 25 If the hybrid offspring are as fit or more fit than the parents reproduction would likely continue
between both species and the hybrids eventually bringing all organisms under the umbrella of one species

have violet flowers and plants with the vv genotype would have white flowers so a total of 480 plants would be
expected to have violet flowers and 20 plants would have white flowers 3 Figure 198 Moths have shifted to a lighter

200 homozygous blue flowers 400 heterozygous blue flowers and 200 red flowers 20 The theory of natural selection
stems from the observation that some individuals in a population survive longer and have more offspring than others
thus more of their genes are passed to the next generation For example a big powerful male gorilla is much more
likely than a smaller weaker one to become the populations silverback the packs leader who mates far more than
the other males of the group Therefore the pack leader will father more offspring who share half of his genes and are
likely to grow bigger and stronger like their father Over time the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in
the population and the average body size as a result will grow larger on average 22 The peacocks tail is a good
example of the handicap principle The tail which makes the males more visible to predators and less able to escape
is clearly a disadvantage to the birds survival But because it is a disadvantage only the most fit males should be able
to survive with it Thus the tail serves as an honest signal of quality to the females of the population therefore the
male will earn more matings and greater reproductive success

evolutionary events took place and in what order certain characteristics and organisms evolved in relation to others
It does not relate to time 18 domain kingdom phylum class order family genus species 20 Phylogenetic trees
are based on evolutionary connections If an analogous similarity were used on a tree this would be erroneous and
furthermore would cause the subsequent branches to be inaccurate 22 Some hypotheses propose that mitochondria
were acquired first followed by the development of the nucleus Others propose that the nucleus evolved first and
that this new eukaryotic cell later acquired the mitochondria Still others hypothesize that prokaryotes descended from
eukaryotes by the loss of genes and complexity

filters that eliminated all bacteria which were visible in the light microscopes at the time As the bacteriafree filtrate
could still cause infections when given to a healthy organism this observation demonstrated the existence of very
small infectious agents These agents were later shown to be unrelated to bacteria and were classified as viruses 24
Rabies virus is a  strand RNA virus that transcribes mRNAs from its genome Group V HIV1 is a singlestranded
RNA retrovirus that uses reverse transcriptase to create a doublestranded DNA copy of its genome which is integrated
into the host humans genome prior to making mRNAs Group VI The genome structure system classifies both viruses
as singlestranded RNA viruses with linear genomes Baltimore classification sorts Rabies virus and HIV1 into two
different groups indicating that the two viruses have very different life cycles However genome structure classification
does not distinguish between the two viruses This leaves out important information regarding virus function and
survival
26 Reverse transcriptase is needed to make more HIV1 viruses so targeting the reverse transcriptase
enzyme may be a way to inhibit the replication of the virus Importantly by targeting reverse transcriptase we do little
harm to the host cell since host cells do not make reverse transcriptase Thus we can specifically attack the virus and
not the host cell when we use reverse transcriptase inhibitors 28 Plant viruses infect crops causing crop damage
and failure and considerable economic losses 30 Rabies vaccine works after a bite because it takes a week for the
virus to travel from the site of the bite to the central nervous system where the most severe symptoms of the disease
occur Adults are not routinely vaccinated for rabies for two reasons first because the routine vaccination of domestic
animals makes it unlikely that humans will contract rabies from an animal bite second if one is bitten by a wild animal
or a domestic animal that one cannot confirm has been immunized there is still time to give the vaccine and avoid the
often fatal consequences of the disease 32 This prionbased disease is transmitted through human consumption of
infected meat 34 The botanist would need to isolate any foreign nucleic acids from infected plant cells and confirm
