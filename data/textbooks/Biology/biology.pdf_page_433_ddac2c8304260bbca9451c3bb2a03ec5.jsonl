Figure 1513 PremRNA splicing involves the precise removal of introns from the primary RNA transcript The
splicing process is catalyzed by protein complexes called spliceosomes that are composed of proteins and RNA
molecules called small nuclear RNAs snRNAs Spliceosomes recognize sequences at the 5 and 3 end of the
intron
Errors in splicing are implicated in cancers and other human diseases What kinds of mutations might lead
to splicing errors Think of different possible outcomes if splicing errors occur
Note that more than 70 individual introns can be present and each has to undergo the process of splicingin
addition to 5 capping and the addition of a polyA tailjust to generate a single translatable mRNA molecule

Processing of tRNAs and rRNAs
The tRNAs and rRNAs are structural molecules that have roles in protein synthesis however these RNAs
are not themselves translated PrerRNAs are transcribed processed and assembled into ribosomes in the
nucleolus PretRNAs are transcribed and processed in the nucleus and then released into the cytoplasm where
they are linked to free amino acids for protein synthesis
Most of the tRNAs and rRNAs in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are first transcribed as a long precursor molecule
that spans multiple rRNAs or tRNAs Enzymes then cleave the precursors into subunits corresponding to each
structural RNA Some of the bases of prerRNAs are methylated that is a CH3 methyl functional group is
added for stability PretRNA molecules also undergo methylation As with premRNAs subunit excision occurs
in eukaryotic preRNAs destined to become tRNAs or rRNAs
