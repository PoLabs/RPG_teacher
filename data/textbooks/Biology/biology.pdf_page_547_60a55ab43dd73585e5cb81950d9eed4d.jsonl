Introduction
This bee and Echinacea flower Figure 201 could not look more different yet they are related as are all living
organisms on Earth By following pathways of similarities and changesboth visible and geneticscientists
seek to map the evolutionary past of how life developed from singlecelled organisms to the tremendous
collection of creatures that have germinated crawled floated swum flown and walked on this planet
201  Organizing Life on Earth
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the need for a comprehensive classification system

List the different levels of the taxonomic classification system

Describe how systematics and taxonomy relate to phylogeny

Discuss a phylogenetic trees components and purpose
In scientific terms phylogeny is the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of organisms
A phylogeny describes the organisims relationships such as from which organisms it may have evolved or to
