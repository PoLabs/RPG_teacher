intracellular hormone receptor
a group of steroid hormones including estradiol and several others that are produced by the ovaries
and elicit secondary sex characteristics in females as well as control the maturation of the ova
the hormone that binds to a plasma membrane hormone receptor to trigger a signal
transduction pathway
hormone produced by the anterior pituitary that stimulates gamete
production
a membrane protein activated by the hormone first messenger to activate formation of cyclic AMP
condition caused by overproduction of GH in children
hormone produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas in response to low blood sugar functions to
raise blood sugar levels
corticosteroid that affects glucose metabolism
synthesis of glucose from amino acids
effect of GH that causes tissues to use fatty acids instead of glucose as an energy
source
breakdown of glycogen into glucose
enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by insufficient dietary iodine levels
hormone that regulates the gonads including FSH and LH
hormone produced by the anterior pituitary that promotes protein synthesis and body
growth
hormone produced by the hypothalamus that inhibits growth
hormone production also called somatostatin
hormone released by the hypothalamus that triggers the
release of GH
release of a hormone in response to another hormone
the cellular protein that binds to a hormone
control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the
ion concentration in the blood
high blood sugar level
overactivity of the thyroid gland
low blood sugar level
system of blood vessels that carries hormones from the hypothalamus to the
anterior pituitary
underactivity of the thyroid gland
hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas in response to high blood glucose levels functions
to lower blood glucose levels
