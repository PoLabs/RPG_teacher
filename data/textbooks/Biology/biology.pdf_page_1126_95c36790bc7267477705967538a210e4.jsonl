Figure 365 Four of the primary mechanoreceptors in human skin are shown Merkels disks which are
unencapsulated respond to light touch Meissners corpuscles Ruffini endings Pacinian corpuscles and Krause
end bulbs are all encapsulated Meissners corpuscles respond to touch and lowfrequency vibration Ruffini
endings detect stretch deformation within joints and warmth Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and
highfrequency vibration Krause end bulbs detect cold
Which of the following statements about mechanoreceptors is false
a
Pacinian corpuscles are found in both glabrous and hairy skin
b
Merkels disks are abundant on the fingertips and lips
c
Ruffini endings are encapsulated mechanoreceptors
d
Meissners corpuscles extend into the lower dermis
Meissners corpuscles shown in Figure 366 also known as tactile corpuscles are found in the upper dermis
but they project into the epidermis They too are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and
eyelids They respond to fine touch and pressure but they also respond to lowfrequency vibration or flutter
They are rapidly adapting fluidfilled encapsulated neurons with small welldefined borders and are responsive
to fine details Like Merkels disks Meissners corpuscles are not as plentiful in the palms as they are in the
fingertips
Figure 366 Meissner corpuscles in the fingertips such as the one viewed here using bright field light microscopy
allow for touch discrimination of fine detail credit modification of work by WbensmithWikimedia Commons scale

Deeper in the epidermis near the base are Ruffini endings which are also known as bulbous corpuscles They
are found in both glabrous and hairy skin These are slowadapting encapsulated mechanoreceptors that detect
skin stretch and deformations within joints so they provide valuable feedback for gripping objects and controlling
finger position and movement Thus they also contribute to proprioception and kinesthesia Ruffini endings also
