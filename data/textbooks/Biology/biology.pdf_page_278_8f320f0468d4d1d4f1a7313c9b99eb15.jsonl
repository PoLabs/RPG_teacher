Termination of the Signal Cascade
The aberrant signaling often seen in tumor cells is proof that the termination of a signal at the appropriate time
can be just as important as the initiation of a signal One method of stopping a specific signal is to degrade
the ligand or remove it so that it can no longer access its receptor One reason that hydrophobic hormones
like estrogen and testosterone trigger longlasting events is because they bind carrier proteins These proteins
allow the insoluble molecules to be soluble in blood but they also protect the hormones from degradation by
circulating enzymes
Inside the cell many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications that result from signaling cascades
For example phosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in
a process called dephosphorylation Cyclic AMP cAMP is degraded into AMP by phosphodiesterase and the
release of calcium stores is reversed by the Ca2 pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes
of the cell
94  Signaling in SingleCelled Organisms
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how singlecelled yeasts use cell signaling to communicate with one another

Relate the role of quorum sensing to the ability of some bacteria to form biofilms
Withincell signaling allows bacteria to respond to environmental cues such as nutrient levels Some single
celled organisms also release molecules to signal to each other
Signaling in Yeast
Yeasts are eukaryotes fungi and the components and processes found in yeast signals are similar to those
of cellsurface receptor signals in multicellular organisms Budding yeasts Figure 916 are able to participate
in a process that is similar to sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells cells with onehalf the normal
number of chromosomes combining to form a diploid cell a cell with two sets of each chromosome which is
what normal body cells contain In order to find another haploid yeast cell that is prepared to mate budding
yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor When mating factor binds to cellsurface receptors in
other yeast cells that are nearby they stop their normal growth cycles and initiate a cell signaling cascade that
