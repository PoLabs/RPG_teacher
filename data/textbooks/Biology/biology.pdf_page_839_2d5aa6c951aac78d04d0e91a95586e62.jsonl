Morphology
Characteristic features of the arthropods include the presence of jointed appendages body segmentation
and chitinized exoskeleton Fusion of adjacent groups of segments gave rise to functional body regions
called tagmata singular  tagma Tagmata may be in the form of a head thorax and abdomen or a
cephalothorax and abdomen or a head and trunk depending on the taxon Commonly described tagmata
may be composed of different numbers of segments for example the head of most insects results from the
fusion of six ancestral segments whereas the head of another arthropod may be made of fewer ancestral
segments due to independent evolutionary events Jointed arthropod appendages often in segmental pairs
have been specialized for various functions sensing their environment antennae capturing and manipulating
food mandibles and maxillae as well as for walking jumping digging and swimming
In the arthropod body a central cavity called the hemocoel or blood cavity is present and the hemocoel fluids
are moved by contraction of regions of the tubular dorsal blood vessel called hearts Groups of arthropods also
differ in the organs used for nitrogenous waste excretion with crustaceans possessing green glands and insects
using Malpighian tubules which work in conjunction with the hindgut to reabsorb water while ridding the body
of nitrogenous waste The nervous system tends to be distributed among the segments with larger ganglia in
segments with sensory structures or appendages The ganglia are connected by a ventral nerve cord
Respiratory systems vary depending on the group of arthropod Insects and myriapods use a series of tubes
tracheae that branch through the body ending in minute tracheoles These fine respiratory tubes perform
gas exchange directly between the air and cells within the organism The major tracheae open to the surface
of the cuticle via apertures called spiracles We should note that these tracheal systems of ventilation have
evolved independently in hexapods myriapods and arachnids Although the tracheal system works extremely
well in terrestrial environments it also works well in freshwater aquatic environments In fact numerous species
of aquatic insects in both immature and adult stages possess tracheal systems However although there are
insects that live on the surface of marine environments none is strictly marinemeaning that they complete
their entire metamorphosis in salt water
In contrast aquatic crustaceans utilize gills terrestrial chelicerates employ book lungs and aquatic chelicerates
use book gills Figure 2837 The book lungs of arachnids scorpions spiders ticks and mites contain a
vertical stack of hemocoel wall tissue that somewhat resembles the pages of a book Between each of the
pages of tissue is an air space This allows both sides of the tissue to be in contact with the air at all
times greatly increasing the efficiency of gas exchange The gills of crustaceans are filamentous structures that
exchange gases with the surrounding water
The cuticle is the hard covering of an arthropod It is made up of two layers the epicuticle which is a
thin waxy waterresistant outer layer containing no chitin and the layer beneath it the chitinous procuticle
which itself is composed of an exocuticle and a lower endocuticle all supported ultimately by a basement
membrane The exoskeleton is very protective it is sometimes difficult to squish a big beetle but does not
sacrifice flexibility or mobility Both the exocuticle which is secreted before a molt and an endocuticle which
is secreted after a molt are composed of chitin bound with a protein chitin is insoluble in water alkalis and
weak acids The procuticle is not only flexible and lightweight but also provides protection against dehydration
and other biological and physical stresses Some hexapods such as the crustaceans add calcium salts to their
exoskeleton which increases the strength of the cuticle but does reduce its flexibility In some cases such as
lobsters the amount of calcium salt deposited within the chitin is extreme In order to grow the arthropod must
shed the exoskeleton during the physiological process called molting following by the actual stripping of the
