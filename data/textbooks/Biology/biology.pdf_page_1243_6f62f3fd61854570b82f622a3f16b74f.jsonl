Patm the atmospheric pressure is the sum of all of the partial pressures of the atmospheric gases added
together
Patm  PN2   PO2   PH2 O  PCO2  760 mm Hg
 percent content in mixture
The pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 760 mm Hg Therefore the partial pressure of oxygen is
PO2  760 mm Hg 021  160 mm Hg
and for carbon dioxide
PCO2  760 mm Hg 00004  03 mm Hg
At high altitudes Patm decreases but concentration does not change the partial pressure decrease is due to the
reduction in Patm
When the air mixture reaches the lung it has been humidified The pressure of the water vapor in the lung does
not change the pressure of the air but it must be included in the partial pressure equation For this calculation
the water pressure 47 mm Hg is subtracted from the atmospheric pressure
760 mm Hg  47 mm Hg    713 mm Hg
and the partial pressure of oxygen is
760 mm Hg  47 mm Hg  021   150 mm Hg
These pressures determine the gas exchange or the flow of gas in the system Oxygen and carbon dioxide will
flow according to their pressure gradient from high to low Therefore understanding the partial pressure of each
gas will aid in understanding how gases move in the respiratory system
Gas Exchange across the Alveoli
In the body oxygen is used by cells of the bodys tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product The
ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption is the respiratory quotient RQ RQ varies between
07 and 10 If just glucose were used to fuel the body the RQ would equal one One mole of carbon dioxide
would be produced for every mole of oxygen consumed Glucose however is not the only fuel for the body
Protein and fat are also used as fuels for the body Because of this less carbon dioxide is produced than oxygen
is consumed and the RQ is on average about 07 for fat and about 08 for protein
The RQ is used to calculate the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar spaces within the lung the alveolar
PO2  Above the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs was calculated to be 150 mm Hg However lungs
never fully deflate with an exhalation therefore the inspired air mixes with this residual air and lowers the partial
pressure of oxygen within the alveoli This means that there is a lower concentration of oxygen in the lungs
than is found in the air outside the body Knowing the RQ the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli can be
calculated

With an RQ of 08 and a PCO2 in the alveoli of 40 mm Hg the alveolar PO2 is equal to

Notice that this pressure is less than the external air Therefore the oxygen will flow from the inspired air in the
lung  PO2  150 mm Hg into the bloodstream  PO2  100 mm Hg Figure 3913
In the lungs oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli Oxygen about
98 percent binds reversibly to the respiratory pigment hemoglobin found in red blood cells RBCs RBCs carry
oxygen to the tissues where oxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and diffuses into the cells of the tissues
More specifically alveolar PO2 is higher in the alveoli  PALVO 2  100 mm Hg than blood PO2 40 mm Hg in
the capillaries Because this pressure gradient exists oxygen diffuses down its pressure gradient moving out of
