develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions Fungal infections are generally very difficult to treat because
unlike bacteria fungi are eukaryotes Antibiotics only target prokaryotic cells whereas compounds that kill fungi
also harm the eukaryotic animal host
Many fungal infections are superficial that is they occur on the animals skin Termed cutaneous skin
mycoses they can have devastating effects For example the decline of the worlds frog population in recent
years is caused in part by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis This deadly fungus infects the
skin of frogs and presumably interferes with cutaneous gaseous exchange which is essential for amphibian
survival Similarly more than a million bats in the United States have been killed by whitenose syndrome which
appears as a white ring around the mouth of the bat It is caused by the coldloving fungus Pseudogymnoascus
destructans which disseminates its deadly spores in caves where bats hibernate Mycologists are researching
the transmission mechanism and control of P destructans to stop its spread
Fungi that cause the superficial mycoses of the epidermis hair and nails rarely spread to the underlying tissue
Figure 2427 These fungi are often misnamed dermatophytes from the Greek words dermis meaning skin
and phyte meaning plant although they are not plants Dermatophytes are also called ringworms because of
the red ring they cause on skin They secrete extracellular enzymes that break down keratin a protein found in
hair skin and nails causing conditions such as athletes foot and jock itch These conditions are usually treated
with overthecounter topical creams and powders and are easily cleared More persistent superficial mycoses
may require prescription oral medications

Systemic mycoses spread to internal organs most commonly entering the body through the respiratory system
For example coccidioidomycosis often called valley fever is commonly found in the southwestern United
States but as far north as Washington where the fungus resides in the dust Once inhaled the spores
develop in the lungs and cause symptoms similar to those of tuberculosis Histoplasmosis is caused by the
dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum In its human host Histoplasma grows as a yeast causing pulmonary
infections and in rarer cases swelling of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord Treatment of these and
many other fungal diseases requires the use of antifungal medications that have serious side effects
Opportunistic mycoses are fungal infections that are either common in all environments or part of the normal
biota They mainly affect individuals who have a compromised immune system Patients in the late stages of
AIDS suffer from opportunistic mycoses that can be life threatening The yeast Candida sp a common member
of the natural biota can grow unchecked and infect the vagina or mouth oral thrush if the pH of the surrounding
environment the persons immune defenses or the normal population of bacteria are altered
Mycetismus can occur when poisonous mushrooms are eaten It causes a number of human fatalities during
mushroompicking season Many edible fruiting bodies of fungi resemble highly poisonous relatives and
amateur mushroom hunters are cautioned to carefully inspect their harvest and avoid eating mushrooms of
doubtful origin The adage there are bold mushroom pickers and old mushroom pickers but are there no old
bold mushroom pickers is unfortunately true
