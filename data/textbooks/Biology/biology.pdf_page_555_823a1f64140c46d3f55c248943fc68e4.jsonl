Why Does Phylogeny Matter
Evolutionary biologists could list many reasons why understanding phylogeny is important to everyday life
in human society For botanists phylogeny acts as a guide to discovering new plants that can be used to
benefit people Think of all the ways humans use plantsfood medicine and clothing are a few examples
If a plant contains a compound that is effective in treating cancer scientists might want to examine all of the
compounds for other useful drugs
A research team in China identified a DNA segment that they thought to be common to some medicinal
plants in the family Fabaceae the legume family They worked to identify which species had this segment
Figure 209 After testing plant species in this family the team found a DNA marker a known location
on a chromosome that enabled them to identify the species present Then using the DNA to uncover
phylogenetic relationships the team could identify whether a newly discovered plant was in this family and
assess its potential medicinal properties
Figure 209 Dalbergia sissoo D sissoo is in the Fabaceae or legume family Scientists found that D sissoo
shares a DNA marker with species within the Fabaceae family that have antifungal properties Subsequently
researchers found that D sissoo had fungicidal activity supporting the idea that DNA markers are useful to screen
plants with potential medicinal properties
