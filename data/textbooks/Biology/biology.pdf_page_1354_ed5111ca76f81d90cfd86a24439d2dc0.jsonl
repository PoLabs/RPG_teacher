Female Reproductive Anatomy
A number of reproductive structures are exterior to the females body These include the breasts and the vulva
which consists of the mons pubis clitoris labia majora labia minora and the vestibular glands all illustrated in
Figure 4310 The location and functions of the female reproductive organs are summarized in Table 432 The
vulva is an area associated with the vestibule which includes the structures found in the inguinal groin area
of women The mons pubis is a round fatty area that overlies the pubic symphysis The clitoris is a structure
with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during
intercourse The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis
and enclose the other components of the vulva The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces
the scrotum in a male The labia minora are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the labia majora These
labia protect the openings to the vagina and urethra The mons pubis and the anterior portion of the labia majora
become covered with hair during adolescence the labia minora is hairless The greater vestibular glands are
found at the sides of the vaginal opening and provide lubrication during intercourse
