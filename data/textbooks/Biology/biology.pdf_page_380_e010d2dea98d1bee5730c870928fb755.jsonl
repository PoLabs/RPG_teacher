Polyploidy
We call an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets two for diploid species polyploid
For instance fertilizing an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote
Polyploid animals are extremely rare with only a few examples among the flatworms crustaceans amphibians
fish and lizards Polyploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally and instead produces
mostly aneuploid daughter cells that cannot yield viable zygotes Rarely polyploid animals can reproduce
asexually by haplodiploidy in which an unfertilized egg divides mitotically to produce offspring In contrast
polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom and polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than
euploids of their species Figure 138
