Soil Formation
Soil formation is the consequence of a combination of biological physical and chemical processes Soil should
ideally contain 50 percent solid material and 50 percent pore space About onehalf of the pore space should
contain water and the other half should contain air The organic component of soil serves as a cementing agent
returns nutrients to the plant allows soil to store moisture makes soil tillable for farming and provides energy for
soil microorganisms Most soil microorganismsbacteria algae or fungiare dormant in dry soil but become
active once moisture is available
Soil distribution is not homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers together the vertical
section of a soil is called the soil profile Within the soil profile soil scientists define zones called horizons A
horizon is a soil layer with distinct physical and chemical properties that differ from those of other layers Five
factors account for soil formation parent material climate topography biological factors and time
Parent Material
The organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material Mineral soils form directly from the
weathering of bedrock the solid rock that lies beneath the soil and therefore they have a similar composition to
the original rock Other soils form in materials that came from elsewhere such as sand and glacial drift Materials
located in the depth of the soil are relatively unchanged compared with the deposited material Sediments in
rivers may have different characteristics depending on whether the stream moves quickly or slowly A fast
moving river could have sediments of rocks and sand whereas a slowmoving river could have finetextured
material such as clay
Climate
Temperature moisture and wind cause different patterns of weathering and therefore affect soil characteristics
The presence of moisture and nutrients from weathering will also promote biological activity a key component
of a quality soil
Topography
Regional surface features familiarly called the lay of the land can have a major influence on the characteristics
and fertility of a soil Topography affects water runoff which strips away parent material and affects plant growth
Steeps soils are more prone to erosion and may be thinner than soils that are relatively flat or level
Biological factors
The presence of living organisms greatly affects soil formation and structure Animals and microorganisms can
produce pores and crevices and plant roots can penetrate into crevices to produce more fragmentation Plant
secretions promote the development of microorganisms around the root in an area known as the rhizosphere
Additionally leaves and other material that fall from plants decompose and contribute to soil composition
Time
Time is an important factor in soil formation because soils develop over long periods Soil formation is a dynamic
process Materials are deposited over time decompose and transform into other materials that can be used by
living organisms or deposited onto the surface of the soil
Physical Properties of the Soil
Soils are named and classified based on their horizons The soil profile has four distinct layers 1 O horizon
2 A horizon 3 B horizon or subsoil and 4 C horizon or soil base Figure 317 The O horizon has freshly
decomposing organic matterhumusat its surface with decomposed vegetation at its base Humus enriches
the soil with nutrients and enhances soil moisture retention Topsoilthe top layer of soilis usually two to
three inches deep but this depth can vary considerably For instance river deltas like the Mississippi River
delta have deep layers of topsoil Topsoil is rich in organic material microbial processes occur there and it
is the workhorse of plant production The A horizon consists of a mixture of organic material with inorganic
products of weathering and it is therefore the beginning of true mineral soil This horizon is typically darkly
colored because of the presence of organic matter In this area rainwater percolates through the soil and carries
materials from the surface The B horizon is an accumulation of mostly fine material that has moved downward
resulting in a dense layer in the soil In some soils the B horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium
carbonate The C horizon or soil base includes the parent material plus the organic and inorganic material
that is broken down to form soil The parent material may be either created in its natural place or transported
from elsewhere to its present location Beneath the C horizon lies bedrock
