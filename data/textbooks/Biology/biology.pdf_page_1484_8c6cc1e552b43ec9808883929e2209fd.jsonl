Water cycling is extremely important to ecosystem dynamics Water has a major influence on climate and
thus on the environments of ecosystems Most of the water on Earth is stored for long periods in the oceans
underground and as ice Figure 4613 illustrates the average time that an individual water molecule may spend
in the Earths major water reservoirs Residence time is a measure of the average time an individual water
molecule stays in a particular reservoir
Figure 4613 This graph shows the average residence time for water molecules in the Earths water reservoirs
There are various processes that occur during the cycling of water shown in Figure 4614 These processes
include the following

evaporationsublimation

condensationprecipitation

subsurface water flow

surface runoffsnowmelt

streamflow
The water cycle is driven by the suns energy as it warms the oceans and other surface waters This leads to
the evaporation water to water vapor of liquid surface water and the sublimation ice to water vapor of frozen
water which deposits large amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere Over time this water vapor condenses
into clouds as liquid or frozen droplets and is eventually followed by precipitation rain or snow which returns
water to the Earths surface Rain eventually permeates into the ground where it may evaporate again if it is
near the surface flow beneath the surface or be stored for long periods More easily observed is surface runoff
the flow of fresh water either from rain or melting ice Runoff can then make its way through streams and lakes
to the oceans or flow directly to the oceans themselves

Rain and surface runoff are major ways in which minerals including carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur
are cycled from land to water The environmental effects of runoff will be discussed later as these cycles are
