the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall The outer layer of cells is
called the epicardium of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium
that surrounds and protects the heart it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in
place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures
The heart has its own blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood The coronary arteries branch
from the aorta and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown They diverge into capillaries where the
heart muscle is supplied with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated
blood back to the right atrium where the blood will be reoxygenated through the pulmonary circuit The heart
muscle will die without a steady supply of blood Atherosclerosis is the blockage of an artery by the buildup of
fatty plaques Because of the size narrow of the coronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself
atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries The slowdown of blood flow and subsequent oxygen deprivation
that results from atherosclerosis causes severe pain known as angina and complete blockage of the arteries
will cause myocardial infarction the death of cardiac muscle tissue commonly known as a heart attack
The Cardiac Cycle
The main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body it does so in a repeating sequence called the
cardiac cycle The cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical
signals that cause the heart muscles to contract and relax The human heart beats over 100000 times per day
In each cardiac cycle the heart contracts  systole pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body this
is followed by a relaxation phase  diastole where the heart fills with blood as illustrated in Figure 4012 The
atria contract at the same time forcing blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles Closing of
the atrioventricular valves produces a monosyllabic lup sound Following a brief delay the ventricles contract
at the same time forcing blood through the semilunar valves into the aorta and the artery transporting blood to
the lungs via the pulmonary artery Closing of the semilunar valves produces a monosyllabic dup sound
Figure 4012 During a cardiac diastole the heart muscle is relaxed and blood flows into the heart During b atrial
systole the atria contract pushing blood into the ventricles During c atrial diastole the ventricles contract forcing
blood out of the heart
The pumping of the heart is a function of the cardiac muscle cells or cardiomyocytes that make up the heart
muscle Cardiomyocytes shown in Figure 4013 are distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal
muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle they are connected by intercalated disks
exclusive to cardiac muscle They are selfstimulated for a period of time and isolated cardiomyocytes will beat
if given the correct balance of nutrients and electrolytes
