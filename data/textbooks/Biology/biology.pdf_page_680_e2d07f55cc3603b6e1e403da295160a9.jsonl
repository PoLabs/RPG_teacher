polysaccharides called chitin and glucans Chitin NacetylDglucosamine also found in the exoskeleton of
arthropods such as insects gives structural strength to the cell walls of fungi The wall protects the cell from
desiccation and some predators Fungi have plasma membranes similar to those of other eukaryotes except
that the structure is stabilized by ergosterol a steroid molecule that replaces the cholesterol found in animal cell
membranes Most members of the kingdom Fungi are nonmotile However flagella are produced by the spores
and gametes in the primitive Phylum Chytridiomycota
Growth
The vegetative body of a fungus is a unicellular or multicellular thallus Unicellular fungi are called yeasts
Multicellular fungi produce threadlike hyphae singular hypha Dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular
to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions Saccharomyces cerevisiae bakers yeast and
Candida species the agents of thrush a common fungal infection are examples of unicellular fungi Figure

Figure 243 Candida albicans Candida albicans is a yeast cell and the agent of candidiasis and thrush This organism
has a similar morphology to coccus bacteria however yeast is a eukaryotic organism note the nucleus credit

Most fungi are multicellular organisms They display two distinct morphological stages the vegetative and
reproductive The vegetative stage consists of a tangle of hyphae whereas the reproductive stage can be more
conspicuous The mass of hyphae is a mycelium Figure 244 It can grow on a surface in soil or decaying
material in a liquid or even on living tissue Although individual hyphae must be observed under a microscope
the mycelium of a fungus can be very large with some species truly being the fungus humongous The giant
Armillaria solidipes honey mushroom is considered the largest organism on Earth spreading across more than
2000 acres of underground soil in eastern Oregon it is estimated to be at least 2400 years old
Figure 244 A fungal mycelium The mycelium of the fungus Neotestudina rosati can be pathogenic to humans The
fungus enters through a cut or scrape and develops a mycetoma a chronic subcutaneous infection credit CDC
Most fungal hyphae are divided into separate cells by endwalls called septa singular septum Figure 245a
