tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax
Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed it is painful because the inflammation increases
the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung

The Work of Breathing
The number of breaths per minute is the respiratory rate On average under nonexertion conditions the
human respiratory rate is 1215 breathsminute The respiratory rate contributes to the alveolar ventilation or
how much air moves into and out of the alveoli Alveolar ventilation prevents carbon dioxide buildup in the alveoli
There are two ways to keep the alveolar ventilation constant increase the respiratory rate while decreasing
the tidal volume of air per breath shallow breathing or decrease the respiratory rate while increasing the tidal
volume per breath In either case the ventilation remains the same but the work done and type of work needed
are quite different Both tidal volume and respiratory rate are closely regulated when oxygen demand increases
There are two types of work conducted during respiration flowresistive and elastic work Flowresistive refers
to the work of the alveoli and tissues in the lung whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal
muscles chest wall and diaphragm Increasing the respiration rate increases the flowresistive work of the
airways and decreases the elastic work of the muscles Decreasing the respiratory rate reverses the type of work
required
Surfactant
The airtissuewater interface of the alveoli has a high surface tension This surface tension is similar to the
surface tension of water at the liquidair interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water
molecules together Surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the
