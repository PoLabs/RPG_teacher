If the nucleolus were not able to carry out its function what other cellular organelles would be affected
The Plasma Membrane
Like prokaryotes eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane Figure 49 a phospholipid bilayer with
embedded proteins that separates the internal contents of the cell from its surrounding environment A
phospholipid is a lipid molecule with two fatty acid chains and a phosphatecontaining group The plasma
membrane controls the passage of organic molecules ions water and oxygen into and out of the cell Wastes
such as carbon dioxide and ammonia also leave the cell by passing through the plasma membrane
Figure 49 The eukaryotic plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with proteins and cholesterol embedded in it
The plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption fold into fingerlike projections that we call microvilli
singular  microvillus Figure 410 Such cells typically line the small intestine the organ that absorbs
nutrients from digested food This is an excellent example of form following function People with celiac disease
have an immune response to gluten which is a protein in wheat barley and rye The immune response
damages microvilli and thus afflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients This leads to malnutrition cramping
and diarrhea Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a glutenfree diet
Figure 410 Microvilli as they appear on cells lining the small intestine increase the surface area available for
absorption These microvilli are only on the area of the plasma membrane that faces the cavity from which substances
will be absorbed credit micrograph modification of work by Louisa Howard
The Cytoplasm
The cytoplasm is the cells entire region between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope a structure
we will discuss shortly It is comprised of organelles suspended in the gellike cytosol the cytoskeleton and
various chemicals Figure 48 Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water it has a semi
solid consistency which comes from the proteins within it However proteins are not the only organic molecules
