By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how hormones regulate the excretory system

Discuss the role of hormones in the reproductive system

Describe how hormones regulate metabolism

Explain the role of hormones in different diseases
Hormones have a wide range of effects and modulate many different body processes The key regulatory
processes that will be examined here are those affecting the excretory system the reproductive system
metabolism blood calcium concentrations growth and the stress response
Hormonal Regulation of the Excretory System
Maintaining a proper water balance in the body is important to avoid dehydration or overhydration
hyponatremia The water concentration of the body is monitored by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus
which detect the concentration of electrolytes in the extracellular fluid The concentration of electrolytes in the
blood rises when there is water loss caused by excessive perspiration inadequate water intake or low blood
volume due to blood loss An increase in blood electrolyte levels results in a neuronal signal being sent from
the osmoreceptors in hypothalamic nuclei The pituitary gland has two components anterior and posterior The
anterior pituitary is composed of glandular cells that secrete protein hormones The posterior pituitary is an
extension of the hypothalamus It is composed largely of neurons that are continuous with the hypothalamus
The hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as antidiuretic hormone ADH which is
transported to and released from the posterior pituitary gland The principal action of ADH is to regulate the
amount of water excreted by the kidneys As ADH which is also known as vasopressin causes direct water
reabsorption from the kidney tubules salts and wastes are concentrated in what will eventually be excreted as
urine The hypothalamus controls the mechanisms of ADH secretion either by regulating blood volume or the
concentration of water in the blood Dehydration or physiological stress can cause an increase of osmolarity
above 300 mOsmL which in turn raises ADH secretion and water will be retained causing an increase in blood
pressure ADH travels in the bloodstream to the kidneys Once at the kidneys ADH changes the kidneys to
become more permeable to water by temporarily inserting water channels aquaporins into the kidney tubules
Water moves out of the kidney tubules through the aquaporins reducing urine volume The water is reabsorbed
into the capillaries lowering blood osmolarity back toward normal As blood osmolarity decreases a negative
feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus and ADH secretion is reduced ADH
release can be reduced by certain substances including alcohol which can cause increased urine production
and dehydration
Chronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in diabetes insipidus If the posterior
pituitary does not release enough ADH water cannot be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine This causes
increased thirst but water taken in is lost again and must be continually consumed If the condition is not severe
dehydration may not occur but severe cases can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration
Another hormone responsible for maintaining electrolyte concentrations in extracellular fluids is aldosterone a
steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex In contrast to ADH which promotes the reabsorption
of water to maintain proper water balance aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na
reabsorption and K secretion from extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules Because it is produced in the
cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the concentrations of minerals Na and K aldosterone is referred to as
a mineralocorticoid a corticosteroid that affects ion and water balance Aldosterone release is stimulated by a
decrease in blood sodium levels blood volume or blood pressure or an increase in blood potassium levels It
also prevents the loss of Na from sweat saliva and gastric juice The reabsorption of Na also results in the
osmotic reabsorption of water which alters blood volume and blood pressure
Aldosterone production can be stimulated by low blood pressure which triggers a sequence of chemical release
as illustrated in Figure 377 When blood pressure drops the reninangiotensinaldosterone system RAAS
is activated Cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus which regulates the functions of the nephrons of the
