wastes The animals must detoxify ammonia by converting it into a relatively nontoxic form such as urea or uric
acid Mammals including humans produce urea whereas reptiles and many terrestrial invertebrates produce
uric acid Animals that secrete urea as the primary nitrogenous waste material are called ureotelic animals
Nitrogenous Waste in Terrestrial Animals The Urea Cycle
The urea cycle is the primary mechanism by which mammals convert ammonia to urea Urea is made in the liver
and excreted in urine The overall chemical reaction by which ammonia is converted to urea is 2 NH3 ammonia
 CO2  3 ATP  H2O  H2NCONH2 urea  2 ADP  4 Pi  AMP
The urea cycle utilizes five intermediate steps catalyzed by five different enzymes to convert ammonia to
urea as shown in Figure 4112 The amino acid Lornithine gets converted into different intermediates before
being regenerated at the end of the urea cycle Hence the urea cycle is also referred to as the ornithine cycle
The enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes a key step in the urea cycle and its deficiency can lead to
accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the body The first two reactions occur in the mitochondria and the
last three reactions occur in the cytosol Urea concentration in the blood called blood urea nitrogen or BUN is
used as an indicator of kidney function
