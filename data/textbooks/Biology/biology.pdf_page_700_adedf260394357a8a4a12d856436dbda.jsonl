FungusAnimal Mutualism
Fungi have evolved mutualisms with numerous insects in Phylum Arthropoda jointlegged invertebrates with
a chitinous exoskeleton Arthropods depend on the fungus for protection from predators and pathogens while
the fungus obtains nutrients and a way to disseminate spores into new environments The association between
species of Basidiomycota and scale insects is one example The fungal mycelium covers and protects the insect
colonies The scale insects foster a flow of nutrients from the parasitized plant to the fungus
In a second example leafcutter ants of Central and South America literally farm fungi They cut disks of
leaves from plants and pile them up in subterranean gardens Figure 2425 Fungi are cultivated in these disk
gardens digesting the cellulose in the leaves that the ants cannot break down Once smaller sugar molecules
are produced and consumed by the fungi the fungi in turn become a meal for the ants The insects also patrol
their garden preying on competing fungi Both ants and fungi benefit from this mutualistic association The
fungus receives a steady supply of leaves and freedom from competition while the ants feed on the fungi they
cultivate

Fungivores
Animal dispersal is important for some fungi because an animal may carry fungal spores considerable distances
from the source Fungal spores are rarely completely degraded in the gastrointestinal tract of an animal and
many are able to germinate when they are passed in the feces Some dung fungi actually require passage
through the digestive system of herbivores to complete their lifecycle The black trufflea prized gourmet
delicacyis the fruiting body of an underground ascomycete Almost all truffles are ectomycorrhizal and are
usually found in close association with trees Animals eat truffles and disperse the spores In Italy and France
truffle hunters use female pigs to sniff out truffles female pigs are attracted to truffles because the fungus
releases a volatile compound closely related to a pheromone produced by male pigs
244  Fungal Parasites and Pathogens
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe some fungal parasites and pathogens of plants

Describe the different types of fungal infections in humans

Explain why antifungal therapy is hampered by the similarity between fungal and animal cells
Parasitism describes a symbiotic relationship in which one member of the association benefits at the expense
of the other Both parasites and pathogens harm the host however pathogens cause disease damage to host
tissues or physiology whereas parasites usually do not but can cause serious damage and death by competition
