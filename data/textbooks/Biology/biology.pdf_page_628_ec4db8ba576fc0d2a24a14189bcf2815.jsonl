Microbes on the Human Body
The commensal bacteria that inhabit our skin and gastrointestinal tract do a host of good things for us They
protect us from pathogens help us digest our food and produce some of our vitamins and other nutrients
These activities have been known for a long time More recently scientists have gathered evidence that
these bacteria may also help regulate our moods influence our activity levels and even help control weight
by affecting our food choices and absorption patterns The Human Microbiome Project has begun the
process of cataloging our normal bacteria and archaea so we can better understand these functions
A particularly fascinating example of our normal flora relates to our digestive systems People who take
high doses of antibiotics tend to lose many of their normal gut bacteria allowing a naturally antibiotic
resistant species called Clostridium difficile to overgrow and cause severe gastric problems especially
chronic diarrhea Figure 2228 Obviously trying to treat this problem with antibiotics only makes it worse
However it has been successfully treated by giving the patients fecal transplants from healthy donors to
reestablish the normal intestinal microbial community Clinical trials are underway to ensure the safety and
effectiveness of this technique
Figure 2228 Clostridium difficile This scanning electron micrograph shows Clostridium difficile a Grampositive
rodshaped bacterium that causes severe diarrhea Infection commonly occurs after the normal gut fauna are
eradicated by antibiotics and in the hospital can be deadly to seriously ill patients credit modification of work by

Scientists are also discovering that the absence of certain key microbes from our intestinal tract may set
us up for a variety of problems This seems to be particularly true regarding the appropriate functioning of
the immune system There are intriguing findings that suggest that the absence of these microbes is an
important contributor to the development of allergies and some autoimmune disorders Research is currently
underway to test whether adding certain microbes to our internal ecosystem may help in the treatment of
these problems as well as in treating some forms of autism
Early Biotechnology Cheese Bread Wine Beer and Yogurt
According to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity biotechnology is any technological
application that uses biological systems living organisms or derivatives thereof to make or modify products
or processes for specific use
5
The concept of specific use involves some sort of commercial application
Genetic engineering artificial selection antibiotic production and cell culture are current topics of study in
biotechnology and will be described in later chapters However humans were using prokaryotes before the term
biotechnology was even coined Some of the products of this early biotechnology are as familiar as cheese
bread wine beer and yogurt which employ both bacteria and other microbes such as yeast a fungus Figure
