181  Understanding Evolution
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how scientists developed the presentday theory of evolution

Define adaptation

Explain convergent and divergent evolution

Describe homologous and vestigial structures

Discuss misconceptions about the theory of evolution
Evolution by natural selection describes a mechanism for how species change over time Scientists
philosophers researchers and others had made suggestions and debated this topic well before Darwin began
to explore this idea Classical Greek philosopher Plato emphasized in his writings that species were static
and unchanging yet there were also ancient Greeks who expressed evolutionary ideas In the eighteenth
century naturalist GeorgesLouis Leclerc Comte de Buffon reintroduced ideas about the evolution of animals
and observed that various geographic regions have different plant and animal populations even when the
environments are similar Some at this time also accepted that there were extinct species
Also during the eighteenth century James Hutton a Scottish geologist and naturalist proposed that geological
change occurred gradually by accumulating small changes from processes operating like they are today over
long periods of time This contrasted with the predominant view that the planets geology was a consequence
of catastrophic events occurring during a relatively brief past Nineteenth century geologist Charles Lyell
popularized Huttons view A friend to Darwin Lyells ideas were influential on Darwins thinking Lyells notion
of the greater age of Earth gave more time for gradual change in species and the process of change provided
an analogy for this change In the early nineteenth century JeanBaptiste Lamarck published a book that
detailed a mechanism for evolutionary change We now refer to this mechanism as an inheritance of acquired
characteristics by which the environment causes modifications in an individual or offspring could use or disuse
of a structure during its lifetime and thus bring about change in a species While many discredited this
mechanism for evolutionary change Lamarcks ideas were an important influence on evolutionary thought
Charles Darwin and Natural Selection
In the midnineteenth century two naturalists Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace independently
conceived and described the actual mechanism for evolution Importantly each naturalist spent time exploring
the natural world on expeditions to the tropics From 1831 to 1836 Darwin traveled around the world on HMS
Beagle including stops in South America Australia and the southern tip of Africa Wallace traveled to Brazil
to collect insects in the Amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago from 1854 to
1862 Darwins journey like Wallaces later journeys to the Malay Archipelago included stops at several island
chains the last being the Galpagos Islands west of Ecuador On these islands Darwin observed species of
organisms on different islands that were clearly similar yet had distinct differences For example the ground
finches inhabiting the Galpagos Islands comprised several species with a unique beak shape Figure 182
The species on the islands had a graded series of beak sizes and shapes with very small differences between
the most similar He observed that these finches closely resembled another finch species on the South American
mainland Darwin imagined that the island species might be species modified from one of the original mainland
species Upon further study he realized that each finchs varied beaks helped the birds acquire a specific type of
food For example seedeating finches had stronger thicker beaks for breaking seeds and insecteating finches
had spearlike beaks for stabbing their prey
