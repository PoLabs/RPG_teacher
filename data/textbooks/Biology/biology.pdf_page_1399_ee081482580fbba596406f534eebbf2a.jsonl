444  Aquatic Biomes
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the effects of abiotic factors on the composition of plant and animal communities in aquatic
biomes

Compare and contrast the characteristics of the ocean zones

Summarize the characteristics of standing water and flowing water freshwater biomes
Abiotic Factors Influencing Aquatic Biomes
Like terrestrial biomes aquatic biomes are influenced by a series of abiotic factors The aquatic
mediumwater has different physical and chemical properties than air however Even if the water in a pond
or other body of water is perfectly clear there are no suspended particles water on its own absorbs light
As one descends into a deep body of water there will eventually be a depth which the sunlight cannot reach
While there are some abiotic and biotic factors in a terrestrial ecosystem that might obscure light like fog dust
or insect swarms usually these are not permanent features of the environment The importance of light in
aquatic biomes is central to the communities of organisms found in both freshwater and marine ecosystems
In freshwater systems stratification due to differences in density is perhaps the most critical abiotic factor and
is related to the energy aspects of light The thermal properties of water rates of heating and cooling and the
ability to store much larger amounts of energy than the air are significant to the function of marine systems and
have major impacts on global climate and weather patterns Marine systems are also influenced by largescale
physical water movements such as currents these are less important in most freshwater lakes
The ocean is categorized by several areas or zones Figure 4421 All of the oceans open water is referred to
as the pelagic realm or zone The benthic realm or zone extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline
to the deepest parts of the ocean floor Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone which is the portion of
the ocean that light can penetrate approximately 200 m or 650 ft At depths greater than 200 m light cannot
penetrate thus this is referred to as the aphotic zone The majority of the ocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient
light for photosynthesis The deepest part of the ocean the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench located
in the western Pacific Ocean is about 11000 m about 68 mi deep To give some perspective on the depth
of this trench the ocean is on average 4267 m or 14000 ft deep These realms and zones are relevant to
freshwater lakes as well
