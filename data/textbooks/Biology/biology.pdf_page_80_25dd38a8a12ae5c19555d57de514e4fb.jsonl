31  Synthesis of Biological Macromolecules
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Understand macromolecule synthesis

Explain dehydration or condensation and hydrolysis reactions
As youve learned biological macromolecules are large molecules necessary for life that are built from
smaller organic molecules There are four major biological macromolecule classes carbohydrates lipids
proteins and nucleic acids Each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions
Combined these molecules make up the majority of a cells dry mass recall that water makes up the majority of
its complete mass Biological macromolecules are organic meaning they contain carbon In addition they may
contain hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and additional minor elements
Dehydration Synthesis
Most macromolecules are made from single subunits or building blocks called monomers The monomers
combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers In doing so
monomers release water molecules as byproducts This type of reaction is dehydration synthesis which
means to put together while losing water
Figure 32 In the dehydration synthesis reaction above two glucose molecules link to form the disaccharide maltose
In the process it forms a water molecule
In a dehydration synthesis reaction Figure 32 the hydrogen of one monomer combines with the hydroxyl
group of another monomer releasing a water molecule At the same time the monomers share electrons and
form covalent bonds As additional monomers join this chain of repeating monomers forms a polymer Different
monomer types can combine in many configurations giving rise to a diverse group of macromolecules Even
one kind of monomer can combine in a variety of ways to form several different polymers For example glucose
monomers are the constituents of starch glycogen and cellulose
Hydrolysis
Polymers break down into monomers during hydrolysis A chemical reaction occurs when inserting a water
molecule across the bond Breaking a covalent bond with this water molecule in the compound achieves this
Figure 33 During these reactions the polymer breaks into two components one part gains a hydrogen atom
H and the other gains a hydroxyl molecule OH from a split water molecule
Figure 33 In the hydrolysis reaction here the disaccharide maltose breaks down to form two glucose monomers by
adding a water molecule Note that this reaction is the reverse of the synthesis reaction in Figure 32
Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed or sped up by specific enzymes dehydration reactions
