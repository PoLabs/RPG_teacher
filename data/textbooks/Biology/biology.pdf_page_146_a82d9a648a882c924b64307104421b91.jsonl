KEY TERMS
see unified cell theory
rigid cell covering comprised of various molecules that protects the cell provides structural support
and gives shape to the cell
large plant cell organelle that regulates the cells storage compartment holds water and plays
a significant role in cell growth as the site of macromolecule degradation
region in animal cells made of two centrioles that serves as an organizing center for microtubules
green pigment that captures the light energy that drives the light reactions of photosynthesis
plant cell organelle that carries out photosynthesis
proteinDNA complex that serves as the chromosomes building material
structure within the nucleus that comprises chromatin that contains DNA the hereditary material
plural  cilia short hairlike structure that extends from the plasma membrane in large numbers and
functions to move an entire cell or move substances along the cells outer surface
entire region between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope consisting of organelles
suspended in the gellike cytosol the cytoskeleton and various chemicals
protein fiber network that collectively maintains the cells shape secures some organelles in
specific positions allows cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell and enables unicellular organisms
to move independently
the cytoplasms gellike material in which cell structures are suspended
linkages between adjacent epithelial cells that form when cadherins in the plasma membrane
attach to intermediate filaments
an instrument that magnifies an object using an electron beam that passes and bends
through a lens system to visualize a specimen
group of organelles and membranes in eukaryotic cells that work together modifying
packaging and transporting lipids and proteins
series of interconnected membranous structures within eukaryotic cells that
collectively modify proteins and synthesize lipids
cell that has a membranebound nucleus and several other membranebound compartments or
sacs
material secreted from animal or fungal cells that provides mechanical protection and
anchoring for the cells in the tissue
plural  flagella long hairlike structure that extends from the plasma membrane and moves the cell
channel between two adjacent animal cells that allows ions nutrients and low molecular weight
substances to pass between cells enabling the cells to communicate
eukaryotic organelle comprised of a series of stacked membranes that sorts tags and
packages lipids and proteins for distribution
cytoskeletal component comprised of several fibrous protein intertwined strands that
bears tension supports cellcell junctions and anchors cells to extracellular structures
an instrument that magnifies an object using a beam of visible light that passes and bends
