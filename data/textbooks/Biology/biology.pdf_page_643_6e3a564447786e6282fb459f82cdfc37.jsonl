the cell However their reproduction is synchronized with the activity and division of the cell These features all
support the theory that mitochondria were once freeliving prokaryotes
Some living eukaryotes are anaerobic and cannot survive in the presence of too much oxygen However a few
appear to lack organelles that could be recognized as mitochondria In the 1970s and on into the early 1990s
many biologists suggested that some of these eukaryotes were descended from ancestors whose lineages
had diverged from the lineage of mitochondrioncontaining eukaryotes before endosymbiosis occurred Later
findings suggest that reduced organelles are found in most if not all anaerobic eukaryotes and that virtually all
eukaryotes appear to carry some genes in their nuclei that are of mitochondrial origin
In addition to the aerobic generation of ATP mitochondria have several other metabolic functions One of
these functions is to generate clusters of iron and sulfur that are important cofactors of many enzymes Such
functions are often associated with the reduced mitochondrionderived organelles of anaerobic eukaryotes The
protist Monocercomonoides an inhabitant of vertebrate digestive tracts appears to be an exception it has
no mitochondria and its genome contains neither genes derived from mitochondria nor nuclear genes related
to mitochondrial maintenance However it is related to other protists with reduced mitochondria and probably
represents an endpoint in mitochondrial reduction Although most biologists accept that the last common
ancestor of eukaryotes had mitochondria it appears that the complex relationship between mitochondria and
their host cell continues to evolve
Plastids
Some groups of eukaryotes are photosynthetic Their cells contain in addition to the standard eukaryotic
organelles another kind of organelle called a plastid When such cells are carrying out photosynthesis their
plastids are rich in the pigment chlorophyll a and a range of other pigments called accessory pigments which
are involved in harvesting energy from light Photosynthetic plastids are called chloroplasts Figure 233

Like mitochondria plastids appear to have an endosymbiotic origin This hypothesis was also proposed and
championed with the first direct evidence by Lynn Margulis We now know that plastids are derived from
cyanobacteria that lived inside the cells of an ancestral aerobic heterotrophic eukaryote This is called primary
endosymbiosis and plastids of primary origin are surrounded by two membranes However the best evidence
is that the acquisition of cyanobacterial endosymbionts has happened twice in the history of eukaryotes In
one case the common ancestor of the major lineagesupergroup Archaeplastida took on a cyanobacterial
endosymbiont in the other the ancestor of the small amoeboid rhizarian taxon Paulinella took on a different
cyanobacterial endosymbiont Almost all photosynthetic eukaryotes are descended from the first event and only
a couple of species are derived from the other which in evolutionary terms appears to be more recent
Cyanobacteria are a group of Gramnegative bacteria with all the conventional structures of the group However
unlike most prokaryotes they have extensive internal membranebound sacs called thylakoids Chlorophyll
is a component of these membranes as are many of the proteins of the light reactions of photosynthesis
Cyanobacteria also have the peptidoglycan wall and lipopolysaccharide layer associated with Gramnegative
bacteria
Chloroplasts of primary endosymbiotic origin have thylakoids a circular DNA chromosome and ribosomes
