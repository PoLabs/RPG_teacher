Figure 406 In most vertebrates a hemoglobin delivers oxygen to the body and removes some carbon dioxide
Hemoglobin is composed of four protein subunits two alpha chains and two beta chains and a heme group that has
iron associated with it The iron reversibly associates with oxygen and in so doing is oxidized from Fe2 to Fe3 In
most mollusks and some arthropods b hemocyanin delivers oxygen Unlike hemoglobin hemolymph is not carried in
blood cells but floats free in the hemolymph Copper instead of iron binds the oxygen giving the hemolymph a blue
green color In annelids such as the earthworm and some other invertebrates c hemerythrin carries oxygen Like
hemoglobin hemerythrin is carried in blood cells and has iron associated with it but despite its name hemerythrin
does not contain heme
The small size and large surface area of red blood cells allows for rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide
across the plasma membrane In the lungs carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is taken in by the blood In the
tissues oxygen is released from the blood and carbon dioxide is bound for transport back to the lungs Studies
have found that hemoglobin also binds nitrous oxide NO NO is a vasodilator that relaxes the blood vessels
and capillaries and may help with gas exchange and the passage of red blood cells through narrow vessels
Nitroglycerin a heart medication for angina and heart attacks is converted to NO to help relax the blood vessels
and increase oxygen flow through the body
A characteristic of red blood cells is their glycolipid and glycoprotein coating these are lipids and proteins that
have carbohydrate molecules attached In humans the surface glycoproteins and glycolipids on red blood cells
vary between individuals producing the different blood types such as A B and O Red blood cells have an
average life span of 120 days at which time they are broken down and recycled in the liver and spleen by
phagocytic macrophages a type of white blood cell
White Blood Cells
White blood cells also called leukocytes leuko  white make up approximately one percent by volume of the
cells in blood The role of white blood cells is very different than that of red blood cells they are primarily involved
in the immune response to identify and target pathogens such as invading bacteria viruses and other foreign
organisms White blood cells are formed continually some only live for hours or days but some live for years
The morphology of white blood cells differs significantly from red blood cells They have nuclei and do not
contain hemoglobin The different types of white blood cells are identified by their microscopic appearance after
histologic staining and each has a different specialized function The two main groups both illustrated in Figure
407 are the granulocytes which include the neutrophils eosinophils and basophils and the agranulocytes
which include the monocytes and lymphocytes
