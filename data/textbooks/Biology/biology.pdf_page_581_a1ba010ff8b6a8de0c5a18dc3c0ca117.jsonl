Figure 2110 A temperate bacteriophage has both lytic and lysogenic cycles In the lytic cycle the phage
replicates and lyses the host cell In the lysogenic cycle phage DNA is incorporated into the host genome
where it is passed on to subsequent generations Environmental stressors such as starvation or exposure to toxic
chemicals may cause the prophage to excise and enter the lytic cycle
Which of the following statements is false
a
In the lytic cycle new phages are produced and released into the environment
b
In the lysogenic cycle phage DNA is incorporated into the host genome
c
An environmental stressor can cause the phage to initiate the lysogenic cycle
d
Cell lysis only occurs in the lytic cycle
Plant Viruses
Most plant viruses like the tobacco mosaic virus have singlestranded  RNA genomes However there
are also plant viruses in most other virus categories Unlike bacteriophages plant viruses do not have active
mechanisms for delivering the viral genome across the protective cell wall For a plant virus to enter a new host
plant some type of mechanical damage must occur This damage is often caused by weather insects animals
fire or human activities like farming or landscaping Movement from cell to cell within a plant can be facilitated by
viral modification of plasmodesmata cytoplasmic threads that pass from one plant cell to the next Additionally
plant offspring may inherit viral diseases from parent plants Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of
vectors through contact with an infected plants sap by living organisms such as insects and nematodes and
through pollen The transfer of a virus from one plant to another is known as horizontal transmission whereas
the inheritance of a virus from a parent is called vertical transmission
Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host Table 214 One common symptom is
hyperplasia the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls
Other viruses induce hypoplasia or decreased cell growth in the leaves of plants causing thin yellow areas to
appear Still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells a process known as cell necrosis Other
symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves black streaks on the stems of the plants altered growth of
stems leaves or fruits and ring spots which are circular or linear areas of discoloration found in a leaf
