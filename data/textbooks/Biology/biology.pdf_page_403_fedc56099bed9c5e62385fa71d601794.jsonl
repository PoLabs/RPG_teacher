Figure 1414 A replication fork is formed when helicase separates the DNA strands at the origin of replication
The DNA tends to become more highly coiled ahead of the replication fork Topoisomerase breaks and reforms
DNAs phosphate backbone ahead of the replication fork thereby relieving the pressure that results from this
supercoiling Singlestrand binding proteins bind to the singlestranded DNA to prevent the helix from reforming
Primase synthesizes an RNA primer DNA polymerase III uses this primer to synthesize the daughter DNA strand
On the leading strand DNA is synthesized continuously whereas on the lagging strand DNA is synthesized in
short stretches called Okazaki fragments DNA polymerase I replaces the RNA primer with DNA DNA ligase seals
the gaps between the Okazaki fragments joining the fragments into a single DNA molecule credit modification

Question You isolate a cell strain in which the joining of Okazaki fragments is impaired and suspect that
a mutation has occurred in an enzyme found at the replication fork Which enzyme is most likely to be
mutated
The replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second Topoisomerase prevents the overwinding
of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up it does so by causing temporary
nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it Because DNA polymerase can only extend in the 5 to 3 direction
and because the DNA double helix is antiparallel there is a slight problem at the replication fork The two
template DNA strands have opposing orientations one strand is in the 5 to 3 direction and the other is oriented
in the 3 to 5 direction Only one new DNA strand the one that is complementary to the 3 to 5 parental DNA
strand can be synthesized continuously towards the replication fork This continuously synthesized strand is
known as the leading strand The other strand complementary to the 5 to 3 parental DNA is extended away
from the replication fork in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments each requiring a primer to start the
synthesis New primer segments are laid down in the direction of the replication fork but each pointing away
from it Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them The strand with
the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand
The leading strand can be extended from a single primer whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for
each of the short Okazaki fragments The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3 to 5 and that of the
leading strand 5 to 3 A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues
to add nucleotides The sliding clamp is a ringshaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase
in place As synthesis proceeds the RNA primers are replaced by DNA The primers are removed by the
exonuclease activity of DNA pol I which uses DNA behind the RNA as its own primer and fills in the gaps left by
removal of the RNA nucleotides by the addition of DNA nucleotides The nicks that remain between the newly
synthesized DNA that replaced the RNA primer and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme
DNA ligase which catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkages between the 3OH end of one nucleotide
and the 5 phosphate end of the other fragment
Once the chromosome has been completely replicated the two DNA copies move into two different cells during
cell division
