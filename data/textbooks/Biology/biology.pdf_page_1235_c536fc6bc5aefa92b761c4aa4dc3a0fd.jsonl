Skin and Gills
Earthworms and amphibians use their skin integument as a respiratory organ A dense network of capillaries
lies just below the skin and facilitates gas exchange between the external environment and the circulatory
system The respiratory surface must be kept moist in order for the gases to dissolve and diffuse across cell
membranes
Organisms that live in water need to obtain oxygen from the water Oxygen dissolves in water but at a lower
concentration than in the atmosphere The atmosphere has roughly 21 percent oxygen In water the oxygen
concentration is much lower than that Fish and many other aquatic organisms have evolved gills to take up
the dissolved oxygen from water Figure 394 Gills are thin tissue filaments that are highly branched and
folded When water passes over the gills the dissolved oxygen in water rapidly diffuses across the gills into
the bloodstream The circulatory system can then carry the oxygenated blood to the other parts of the body In
animals that contain coelomic fluid instead of blood oxygen diffuses across the gill surfaces into the coelomic
fluid Gills are found in mollusks annelids and crustaceans

The folded surfaces of the gills provide a large surface area to ensure that the fish gets sufficient oxygen
Diffusion is a process in which material travels from regions of high concentration to low concentration until
equilibrium is reached In this case blood with a low concentration of oxygen molecules circulates through the
gills The concentration of oxygen molecules in water is higher than the concentration of oxygen molecules
in gills As a result oxygen molecules diffuse from water high concentration to blood low concentration
as shown in Figure 395 Similarly carbon dioxide molecules in the blood diffuse from the blood high
concentration to water low concentration
