Figure 2847 Anatomy of a sea star This diagram of a sea star shows the pentaradial pattern typical of adult
echinoderms and the water vascular system that is their defining characteristic
Water Vascular and Hemal Systems
Echinoderms have a unique ambulacral water vascular system derived from part of the coelom or body
cavity The water vascular system consists of a central ring canal and radial canals that extend along each arm
Each radial canal is connected to a double row of tube feet which project through holes in the endoskeleton
and function as tactile and ambulatory structures These tube feet can extend or retract based on the volume
of water present in the system of that arm allowing the animal to move and also allowing it to capture prey
with their suckerlike action Individual tube feet are controlled by bulblike ampullae Seawater enters the system
through an aboral madreporite opposite the oral area where the mouth is located and passes to the ring
canal through a short stone canal Water circulating through these structures facilitates gaseous exchange and
provides a hydrostatic source for locomotion and prey manipulation A hemal system consisting of oral gastric
and aboral rings as well as other vessels running roughly parallel to the water vascular system circulates
nutrients Transport of nutrients and gases is shared by the water vascular and hemal systems in addition to the
visceral body cavity that surrounds the major organs
Nervous System
The nervous system in these animals is a relatively simple comprising a circumoral nerve ring at the center
and five radial nerves extending outward along the arms In addition several networks of nerves are located
in different parts of the body However structures analogous to a brain or large ganglia are not present in
these animals Depending on the group echinoderms may have welldeveloped sensory organs for touch and
chemoreception eg within the tube feet and on tentacles at the tips of the arms as well as photoreceptors
and statocysts
Digestive and Excretory Systems
A mouth located on the oral ventral side opens through a short esophagus to a large baglike stomach The
socalled cardiac stomach can be everted through the mouth during feeding for example when a starfish
everts its stomach into a bivalve prey item to digest the animalalivewithin its own shell There are masses
of digestive glands  pyloric caeca in each arm running dorsally along the arms and overlying the reproductive
glands below them After passing through the pyloric caeca in each arm the digested food is channeled to a
small anus if one exists
Podocytescells specialized for ultrafiltration of bodily fluidsare present near the center of the echinoderm
disc at the junction of the water vascular and hemal systems These podocytes are connected by an internal
system of canals to the madreporite where water enters the stone canal The adult echinoderm typically has a
spacious and fluidfilled coelom Cilia aid in circulating the fluid within the body cavity and lead to the fluidfilled
papulae where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place as well as the secretion of nitrogenous
waste such as ammonia by diffusion
