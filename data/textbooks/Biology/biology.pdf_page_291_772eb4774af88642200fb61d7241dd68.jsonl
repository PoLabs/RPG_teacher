Figure 103 There are 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes in a female human somatic cell The condensed
chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus top removed from a cell during mitosis also called karyokinesis or
nuclear division and spread out on a slide right and artificially arranged according to length left an arrangement
like this is called a karyotype In this image the chromosomes were exposed to fluorescent stains for differentiation of
the different chromosomes A method of staining called chromosome painting employs fluorescent dyes that highlight
chromosomes in different colors credit National Human Genome ProjectNIH
Each copy of a homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a different parent therefore the different
genes alleles themselves are not identical although they code for the same traits such as hair color The
variation of individuals within a species is due to the specific combination of the genes inherited from both
parents Even a slightly altered sequence of nucleotides within a gene can result in an alternative trait For
example there are three possible gene sequences on the human chromosome that code for blood type
sequence A sequence B and sequence O Because all diploid human cells have two copies of the chromosome
that determines blood type the blood type the trait is determined by the two alleles of the marker gene that are
inherited It is possible to have two copies of the same gene sequence on both homologous chromosomes with
one on each for example AA BB or OO or two different sequences such as AB AO or BO
Apparently minor variations of traits such as blood type eye color and handedness contribute to the natural
variation found within a species but even though they seem minor these traits may be connected with the
expression of other traits as of yet unknown However if the entire DNA sequence from any pair of human
homologous chromosomes is compared the difference is much less than one percent The sex chromosomes
X and Y are the single exception to the rule of homologous chromosome uniformity Other than a small amount
of homology that is necessary to accurately produce gametes the genes found on the X and Y chromosomes
are different
Eukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction
If the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus were laid out endtoend it would measure
approximately two meters however its diameter would be only 2 nm Considering that the size of a typical
human cell is about 10 m 100000 cells lined up to equal one meter DNA must be tightly packaged to fit in
the cells nucleus At the same time it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed For this
reason the long strands of DNA are condensed into compact chromosomes during certain stages of the cell
cycle There are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted
In the first level of compaction short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight histone
proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome Figure 104 The DNAhistone complex
is called chromatin The beadlike histone DNA complex is called a nucleosome and DNA connecting the
nucleosomes is called linker DNA A DNA molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double
helix without the histones and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter in contrast with the 2nm diameter of a
DNA double helix
The second level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them coil into a 30nm
chromatin fiber This coiling further condenses the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the
extended form
