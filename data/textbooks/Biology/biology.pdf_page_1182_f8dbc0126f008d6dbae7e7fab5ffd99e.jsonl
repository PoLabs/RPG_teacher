KEY TERMS
condition caused by overproduction of GH in adults
disorder caused by the hyposecretion of corticosteroids
an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP
outer portion of adrenal glands that produces corticosteroids
endocrine glands associated with the kidneys
inner portion of adrenal glands that produces epinephrine and norepinephrine
hormone released by the anterior pituitary which stimulates the
adrenal cortex to release corticosteroids during the longterm stress response
steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that stimulates the reabsorption of Na from
extracellular fluids and secretion of K
endocrine cell of the pancreatic islets that produces the hormone glucagon
hormone derived from amino acids
male sex hormone such as testosterone
portion of the pituitary gland that produces six hormones also called adenohypophysis
hormone produced by the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary
that increases water reabsorption by the kidneys
hormone produced by the heart to reduce blood volume pressure and Na
concentration
endocrine cell of the pancreatic islets that produces the hormone insulin
hormone produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland that functions to lower blood Ca2
levels and promote bone growth
fluid inside the thyroid gland that contains the glycoprotein thyroglobulin
hormone released by the adrenal cortex in response to longterm stress
glucocorticoid produced in response to stress
disorder caused by the hypersecretion of glucocorticoids
disorder caused by underproduction of ADH
disorder caused by low levels of insulin activity
effect of GH that causes blood glucose levels to rise similar to diabetes mellitus
a decrease in the number of hormone receptors in response to increased hormone levels
gland that secretes hormones into the surrounding interstitial fluid which then diffuse into
blood and are carried to various organs and tissues within the body
hormone released by the adrenal medulla in response to a short term stress
hormone produced by the kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production in the bone
marrow
