Can Snail Venom Be Used as a Pharmacological Painkiller
Marine snails of the genus Conus Figure 2826 attack prey with a venomous stinger modified from the
radula The toxin released known as conotoxin is a peptide with internal disulfide linkages Conotoxins can
bring about paralysis in humans indicating that this toxin attacks neurological targets Some conotoxins
have been shown to block neuronal ion channels These findings have led researchers to study conotoxins
for possible medical applications
Conotoxins are an exciting area of potential pharmacological development since these peptides may be
possibly modified and used in specific medical conditions to inhibit the activity of specific neurons For
example conotoxins or modifications of them may be used to induce paralysis in muscles in specific health
applications similar to the use of botulinum toxin Since the entire spectrum of conotoxins as well as their
mechanisms of action is not completely known the study of their potential applications is still in its infancy
Most research to date has focused on their use to treat neurological diseases They have also shown
some efficacy in relieving chronic pain and the pain associated with conditions like sciatica and shingles
The study and use of biotoxinstoxins derived from living organismsare an excellent example of the
application of biological science to modern medicine

The tube above the eyes is a siphon used both to circulate water over the gills and to sample the water for
chemical evidence of prey nearby Note the eyes below the siphon The proboscis through which the venomous
harpoon is projected is located between the eyes credit David Burdick NOAA
Class Cephalopoda head foot animals includes octopuses squids cuttlefish and nautiluses Cephalopods
include both animals with shells as well as animals in which the shell is reduced or absent In the shellbearing
Nautilus the spiral shell is multichambered These chambers are filled with gas or water to regulate buoyancy
A siphuncle runs through the chambers and it is this tube that regulates the amount of water and gases
nitrogen carbon dioxide and oxygen mixture present in the chambers Ammonites and other nautiloid shells
are commonly seen in the fossil record The shell structure in squids and cuttlefish is reduced and is present
internally in the form of a squid pen and cuttlefish bone respectively Cuttle bone is sold in pet stores to help
smooth the beaks of birds and also to provide birds such as egglaying chickens and quail with an inexpensive
natural source of calcium carbonate Examples of cephalopods are shown in Figure 2827
Cephalopods can display vivid and rapidly changing coloration almost like flashing neon signs Typically these
flashing displays are seen in squids and octopuses where they may be used for camouflage and possibly
as signals for mating displays We should note however that researchers are not entirely sure if squid can
actually see color or see color in the same way as we do We know that pigments in the skin are contained
in special pigment cells  chromatophores which can expand or contract to produce different color patterns
But chromatophores can only make yellow red brown and black pigmentation however underneath them is a
whole different set of elements called iridophores and leucophores that reflect light and can make blue green
and white It is possible that squid skin might actually be able to detect some light on its own without even
needing its eyes
