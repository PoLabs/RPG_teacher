kidney detect this and release renin Renin an enzyme circulates in the blood and reacts with a plasma
protein produced by the liver called angiotensinogen When angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin it produces
angiotensin I which is then converted into angiotensin II in the lungs Angiotensin II functions as a hormone
and then causes the release of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal cortex resulting in increased Na
reabsorption water retention and an increase in blood pressure Angiotensin II in addition to being a potent
vasoconstrictor also causes an increase in ADH and increased thirst both of which help to raise blood pressure
Figure 377 ADH and aldosterone increase blood pressure and volume Angiotensin II stimulates release of these
hormones Angiotensin II in turn is formed when renin cleaves angiotensinogen credit modification of work by

Hormonal Regulation of the Reproductive System
Regulation of the reproductive system is a process that requires the action of hormones from the pituitary gland
the adrenal cortex and the gonads During puberty in both males and females the hypothalamus produces
gonadotropinreleasing hormone GnRH which stimulates the production and release of folliclestimulating
hormone FSH and luteinizing hormone LH from the anterior pituitary gland These hormones regulate the
gonads testes in males and ovaries in females and therefore are called gonadotropins In both males and
females FSH stimulates gamete production and LH stimulates production of hormones by the gonads An
increase in gonad hormone levels inhibits GnRH production through a negative feedback loop
Regulation of the Male Reproductive System
In males FSH stimulates the maturation of sperm cells FSH production is inhibited by the hormone inhibin
which is released by the testes LH stimulates production of the sex hormones  androgens by the interstitial
cells of the testes and therefore is also called interstitial cellstimulating hormone
The most widely known androgen in males is testosterone Testosterone promotes the production of sperm and
masculine characteristics The adrenal cortex also produces small amounts of testosterone precursor although
the role of this additional hormone production is not fully understood
