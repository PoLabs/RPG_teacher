Some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy These layers provide diverse and complex
habitats for the variety of plants fungi animals and other organisms within the tropical wet forests
For example epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants which typically are not harmed Epiphytes are
found throughout tropical wet forest biomes Many species of animals use the variety of plants and the complex
structure of the tropical wet forests for food and shelter Some organisms live several meters above ground and
have adapted to this arboreal lifestyle

have high species diversity credit Roosevelt Garcia
Savannas
Savannas are grasslands with scattered trees and they are located in Africa South America and northern
Australia Figure 4412 Savannas are usually hot tropical areas with temperatures averaging from 24 C to 29
C 75 F to 84 F and an annual rainfall of 1040 cm 39157 in Savannas have an extensive dry season
for this reason forest trees do not grow as well as they do in the tropical wet forest or other forest biomes
As a result within the grasses and forbs herbaceous flowering plants that dominate the savanna there are
relatively few trees Figure 4414 Since fire is an important source of disturbance in this biome plants have
evolved welldeveloped root systems that allow them to quickly resprout after a fire
Figure 4414 Savannas like this one in Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in Kenya are dominated by grasses credit

Subtropical Deserts
Subtropical deserts exist between 15 and 30 north and south latitude and are centered on the Tropics of
Cancer and Capricorn Figure 4412 This biome is very dry in some years evaporation exceeds precipitation
Subtropical hot deserts can have daytime soil surface temperatures above 60 C 140 F and nighttime
temperatures approaching 0 C 32 F This is largely due to the lack of atmospheric water In cold deserts
temperatures can be as high as 25 C and can drop below 30 C 22 F Subtropical deserts are characterized
