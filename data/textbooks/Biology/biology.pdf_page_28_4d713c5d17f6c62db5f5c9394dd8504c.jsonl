While scientists usually carefully plan research efforts in both basic science and applied science note that some
discoveries are made by serendipity that is by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise Scottish
biologist Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin when he accidentally left a petri dish of Staphylococcus
bacteria open An unwanted mold grew on the dish killing the bacteria Flemings curiosity to investigate the
reason behind the bacterial death followed by his experiments led to the discovery of the antibiotic penicillin
which is produced by the fungus Penicillium Even in the highly organized world of science luckwhen
combined with an observant curious mindcan lead to unexpected breakthroughs
Reporting Scientific Work
Whether scientific research is basic science or applied science scientists must share their findings in order
for other researchers to expand and build upon their discoveries Collaboration with other scientistswhen
planning conducting and analyzing resultsare all important for scientific research For this reason important
aspects of a scientists work are communicating with peers and disseminating results to peers Scientists can
share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or conference but this approach can reach only the
select few who are present Instead most scientists present their results in peerreviewed manuscripts that are
published in scientific journals Peerreviewed manuscripts are scientific papers that a scientists colleagues
or peers review These colleagues are qualified individuals often experts in the same research area who judge
whether or not the scientists work is suitable for publication The process of peer review helps to ensure that
the research in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original significant logical and thorough Grant proposals
which are requests for research funding are also subject to peer review Scientists publish their work so other
scientists can reproduce their experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings The
experimental results must be consistent with the findings of other scientists
A scientific paper is very different from creative writing Although creativity is required to design experiments
there are fixed guidelines when it comes to presenting scientific results First scientific writing must be brief
concise and accurate A scientific paper needs to be succinct but detailed enough to allow peers to reproduce
the experiments
The scientific paper consists of several specific sectionsintroduction materials and methods results and
discussion This structure is sometimes called the IMRaD format There are usually acknowledgment and
reference sections as well as an abstract a concise summary at the beginning of the paper There might be
additional sections depending on the type of paper and the journal where it will be published For example some
