Tubular Reabsorption and Secretion
Tubular reabsorption occurs in the PCT part of the renal tubule Almost all nutrients are reabsorbed and this
occurs either by passive or active transport Reabsorption of water and some key electrolytes are regulated
and can be influenced by hormones Sodium Na is the most abundant ion and most of it is reabsorbed by
active transport and then transported to the peritubular capillaries Because Na is actively transported out of
the tubule water follows it to even out the osmotic pressure Water is also independently reabsorbed into the
peritubular capillaries due to the presence of aquaporins or water channels in the PCT This occurs due to
the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries However every solute has a
transport maximum and the excess is not reabsorbed
In the loop of Henle the permeability of the membrane changes The descending limb is permeable to water
not solutes the opposite is true for the ascending limb Additionally the loop of Henle invades the renal medulla
which is naturally high in salt concentration and tends to absorb water from the renal tubule and concentrate
the filtrate The osmotic gradient increases as it moves deeper into the medulla Because two sides of the loop
of Henle perform opposing functions as illustrated in Figure 418 it acts as a countercurrent multiplier The
vasa recta around it acts as the countercurrent exchanger
Figure 418 The loop of Henle acts as a countercurrent multiplier that uses energy to create concentration
gradients The descending limb is water permeable Water flows from the filtrate to the interstitial fluid so
osmolality inside the limb increases as it descends into the renal medulla At the bottom the osmolality is higher
inside the loop than in the interstitial fluid Thus as filtrate enters the ascending limb Na and Cl ions exit through
ion channels present in the cell membrane Further up Na is actively transported out of the filtrate and Cl follows
Osmolarity is given in units of milliosmoles per liter mOsmL
Loop diuretics are drugs sometimes used to treat hypertension These drugs inhibit the reabsorption of Na
and Cl ions by the ascending limb of the loop of Henle A side effect is that they increase urination Why do
you think this is the case
By the time the filtrate reaches the DCT most of the urine and solutes have been reabsorbed If the body
requires additional water all of it can be reabsorbed at this point Further reabsorption is controlled by hormones
which will be discussed in a later section Excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption combined with
tubular secretion Undesirable products like metabolic wastes urea uric acid and certain drugs are excreted
by tubular secretion Most of the tubular secretion happens in the DCT but some occurs in the early part of the
collecting duct Kidneys also maintain an acidbase balance by secreting excess H ions
