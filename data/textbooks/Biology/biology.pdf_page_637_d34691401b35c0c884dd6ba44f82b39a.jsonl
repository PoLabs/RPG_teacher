33 Mention three differences between bacteria and
archaea
34 Explain the statement that both types bacteria
and archaea have the same basic structures but
built from different chemical components
35 A scientist isolates a new species of prokaryote
He notes that the specimen is a bacillus with a lipid
bilayer and cell wall that stains positive for
peptidoglycan Its circular chromosome replicates
from a single origin of replication Is the specimen
most likely an Archaea a Grampositive bacterium
or a Gramnegative bacterium How do you know
36 Think about the conditions temperature light
pressure and organic and inorganic materials that
you may find in a deepsea hydrothermal vent What
type of prokaryotes in terms of their metabolic needs
autotrophs phototrophs chemotrophs etc would
you expect to find there
37 Farmers continually rotate the crops grown in
different fields to maintain nutrients in the soil How
would planting soybeans in a field the year after the
field was used to grow carrots help maintain nitrogen
in the soil
38 Imagine a region of soil became contaminated
killing bacteria that decompose dead plants and
animals How would this effect the carbon cycle in
the area Be specific in stating where carbon would
accumulate in the cycle
39 Explain the reason why the imprudent and
excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in a major
global problem
40 Researchers have discovered that washing
spinach with water several times does not prevent
foodborne diseases due to E coli How can you
explain this fact
41 Your friend believes that prokaryotes are always
detrimental and pathogenic How would you explain
to them that they are wrong
42 Many people use antimicrobial soap to kill
bacteria on their hands However overuse may
actually increase the risk of infection How could this
occur
