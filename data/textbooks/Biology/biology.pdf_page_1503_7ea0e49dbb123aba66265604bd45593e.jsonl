There are various initiatives to catalog described species in accessible ways and the internet is facilitating that
effort Nevertheless it has been pointed out that at the current rate of new species descriptions which according
to the State of Observed Species Report is 17000 to 20000 new species per year it will take close to 500 years
to finish describing life on this planet

Over time the task becomes both increasingly difficult and increasingly
easier as extinction removes species from the planet
Naming and counting species may seem like an unimportant pursuit given the other needs of humanity but
determining biodiversity it is not simply an accounting of species Describing a species is a complex process
through which biologists determine an organisms unique characteristics and whether or not that organism
belongs to any other described species or genus It allows biologists to find and recognize the species after
the initial discovery and allows them to follow up on questions about its biology In addition the unique
characteristics of each species make it potentially valuable to humans or other species on which humans
depend
Patterns of Biodiversity
Biodiversity is not evenly distributed on Earth Lake Victoria contained almost 500 species of cichlids alone
ignoring the other fish families present in the lake All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria
therefore the 500 species of cichlids were endemic Endemic species are found in only one location Endemics
with highly restricted distributions are particularly vulnerable to extinction Higher taxonomic levels such as
genera and families can also be endemic Lake Michigan contains about 79 species of fish many of which are
found in other lakes in North America What accounts for the difference in fish diversity in these two lakes Lake
Victoria is an ancient tropical lake while Lake Michigan is a recently formed temperate lake Lake Michigan in
its present form is only about 7000 years old while Lake Victoria in its present form is about 15000 years old
although its basin is about 400000 years in age Biogeographers have suggested these two factors latitude and
age are two of several hypotheses to explain biodiversity patterns on the planet
