Figure 97 Transmitted primarily through contaminated drinking water cholera is a major cause of death in the
developing world and in areas where natural disasters interrupt the availability of clean water The cholera bacterium
Vibrio cholerae creates a toxin that modifies Gproteinmediated cell signaling pathways in the intestines Modern
sanitation eliminates the threat of cholera outbreaks such as the one that swept through New York City in 1866 This
poster from that era shows how at that time the way that the disease was transmitted was not understood credit

Enzymelinked receptors are cellsurface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an
enzyme In some cases the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme Other enzymelinked
receptors have a small intracellular domain that interacts directly with an enzyme The enzymelinked receptors
normally have large extracellular and intracellular domains but the membranespanning region consists of a
single alphahelical region of the peptide strand When a ligand binds to the extracellular domain a signal is
transferred through the membrane activating the enzyme Activation of the enzyme sets off a chain of events
within the cell that eventually leads to a response One example of this type of enzymelinked receptor is
the tyrosine kinase receptor Figure 98 A kinase is an enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from ATP
to another protein The tyrosine kinase receptor transfers phosphate groups to tyrosine molecules tyrosine
residues First signaling molecules bind to the extracellular domain of two nearby tyrosine kinase receptors
The two neighboring receptors then bond together or dimerize Phosphates are then added to tyrosine residues
on the intracellular domain of the receptors phosphorylation The phosphorylated residues can then transmit
the signal to the next messenger within the cytoplasm
