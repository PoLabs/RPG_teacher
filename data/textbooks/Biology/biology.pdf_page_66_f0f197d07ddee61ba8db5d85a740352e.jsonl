Figure 220 This diagram shows the bodys buffering of blood pH levels The blue arrows show the process of raising
pH as more CO2 is made The purple arrows indicate the reverse process the lowering of pH as more bicarbonate is
created
Other examples of buffers are antacids that some people use to combat excess stomach acid Many of these
overthecounter medications work in the same way as blood buffers usually with at least one ion capable of
absorbing hydrogen and moderating pH bringing relief to those who suffer heartburn after eating Waters
unique properties that contribute to this capacity to balance pHas well as waters other characteristicsare
essential to sustaining life on Earth

23  Carbon
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain why carbon is important for life

Describe the role of functional groups in biological molecules
Many complex molecules called macromolecules such as proteins nucleic acids RNA and DNA
carbohydrates and lipids comprise cells The macromolecules are a subset of organic molecules any carbon
containing liquid solid or gas that are especially important for life The fundamental component for all of these
macromolecules is carbon The carbon atom has unique properties that allow it to form covalent bonds to as
many as four different atoms making this versatile element ideal to serve as the basic structural component or
backbone of the macromolecules
Individual carbon atoms have an incomplete outermost electron shell With an atomic number of 6 six electrons
and six protons the first two electrons fill the inner shell leaving four in the second shell Therefore carbon
atoms can form up to four covalent bonds with other atoms to satisfy the octet rule The methane molecule
provides an example it has the chemical formula CH4 Each of its four hydrogen atoms forms a single covalent
bond with the carbon atom by sharing a pair of electrons This results in a filled outermost shell
Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen such as methane CH4
described above We often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuelslike the propane in a gas grill or
the butane in a lighter The many covalent bonds between the atoms in hydrocarbons store a great amount
of energy which releases when these molecules burn oxidize Methane an excellent fuel is the simplest
hydrocarbon molecule with a central carbon atom bonded to four different hydrogen atoms as Figure 221
illustrates The shape of its electron orbitals determines the shape of the methane molecules geometry where
the atoms reside in three dimensions The carbons and the four hydrogen atoms form a tetrahedron with four
triangular faces For this reason we describe methane as having tetrahedral geometry
