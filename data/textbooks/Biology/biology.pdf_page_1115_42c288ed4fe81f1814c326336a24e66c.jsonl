causes release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft Through binding to postsynaptic receptors
the neurotransmitter can cause excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials by depolarizing or
hyperpolarizing respectively the postsynaptic membrane In electrical synapses the action potential is directly
communicated to the postsynaptic cell through gap junctionslarge channel proteins that connect the preand
postsynaptic membranes Synapses are not static structures and can be strengthened and weakened Two
mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are longterm potentiation and longterm depression
353 The Central Nervous System
The vertebrate central nervous system contains the brain and the spinal cord which are covered and protected
by three meninges The brain contains structurally and functionally defined regions In mammals these include
the cortex which can be broken down into four primary functional lobes frontal temporal occipital and
parietal basal ganglia thalamus hypothalamus limbic system cerebellum and brainstemalthough
structures in some of these designations overlap While functions may be primarily localized to one structure in
the brain most complex functions like language and sleep involve neurons in multiple brain regions The
spinal cord is the information superhighway that connects the brain with the rest of the body through its
connections with peripheral nerves It transmits sensory and motor input and also controls motor reflexes
354 The Peripheral Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system contains both the autonomic and sensorysomatic nervous systems The
autonomic nervous system provides unconscious control over visceral functions and has two divisions the
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems The sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful
situations to prepare the animal for a fight or flight response The parasympathetic nervous system is active
during restful periods The sensorysomatic nervous system is made of cranial and spinal nerves that transmit
sensory information from skin and muscle to the CNS and motor commands from the CNS to the muscles
355 Nervous System Disorders
Some general themes emerge from the sampling of nervous system disorders presented above The causes
for most disorders are not fully understoodat least not for all patientsand likely involve a combination of
nature genetic mutations that become risk factors and nurture emotional trauma stress hazardous chemical
exposure Because the causes have yet to be fully determined treatment options are often lacking and only
address symptoms

channels to affect
3 Figure 3526 Which of the following statements is
false
