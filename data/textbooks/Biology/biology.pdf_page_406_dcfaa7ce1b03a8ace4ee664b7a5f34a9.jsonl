Telomeres comprise repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene In humans a sixbasepair sequence
TTAGGG is repeated 100 to 1000 times in the telomere regions In a way these telomeres protect the genes
from getting deleted as cells continue to divide The telomeres are added to the ends of chromosomes by
a separate enzyme telomerase Figure 1416 whose discovery helped in the understanding of how these
repetitive chromosome ends are maintained The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a builtin
RNA template It attaches to the end of the chromosome and DNA nucleotides complementary to the RNA
template are added on the 3 end of the DNA strand Once the 3 end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently
elongated DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes Thus
the ends of the chromosomes are replicated
Figure 1415 The ends of linear chromosomes are maintained by the action of the telomerase enzyme
Telomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem cells It is not active in adult somatic cells For their
discovery of telomerase and its action Elizabeth Blackburn Carol W Greider and Jack W Szostak Figure
1416 received the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 2009
