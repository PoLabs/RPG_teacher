of diffusion All living cells are bathed in liquid whether they are in a singlecelled organism or a multicellular
one Diffusion is effective over a specific distance and limits the size that an individual cell can attain If a cell
is a singlecelled microorganism such as an amoeba it can satisfy all of its nutrient and waste needs through
diffusion If the cell is too large then diffusion is ineffective and the center of the cell does not receive adequate
nutrients nor is it able to effectively dispel its waste
An important concept in understanding how efficient diffusion is as a means of transport is the surface to volume
ratio Recall that any threedimensional object has a surface area and volume the ratio of these two quantities
is the surfacetovolume ratio Consider a cell shaped like a perfect sphere it has a surface area of 4r2 and a
volume of 43r3 The surfacetovolume ratio of a sphere is 3r as the cell gets bigger its surface to volume
ratio decreases making diffusion less efficient The larger the size of the sphere or animal the less surface area
for diffusion it possesses
The solution to producing larger organisms is for them to become multicellular Specialization occurs in complex
organisms allowing cells to become more efficient at doing fewer tasks For example circulatory systems
bring nutrients and remove waste while respiratory systems provide oxygen for the cells and remove carbon
dioxide from them Other organ systems have developed further specialization of cells and tissues and efficiently
control body functions Moreover surfacetovolume ratio applies to other areas of animal development such
as the relationship between muscle mass and crosssectional surface area in supporting skeletons and in the
relationship between muscle mass and the generation of dissipation of heat

Animal Bioenergetics
All animals must obtain their energy from food they ingest or absorb These nutrients are converted to adenosine
triphosphate ATP for shortterm storage and use by all cells Some animals store energy for slightly longer
times as glycogen and others store energy for much longer times in the form of triglycerides housed in
specialized adipose tissues No energy system is one hundred percent efficient and an animals metabolism
produces waste energy in the form of heat If an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant
body temperature it is classified as a warmblooded animal and called an endotherm The insulation used to
conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur fat or feathers The absence of insulation in ectothermic
animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat
The amount of energy expended by an animal over a specific time is called its metabolic rate The rate is
measured variously in joules calories or kilocalories 1000 calories Carbohydrates and proteins contain about
45 to 5 kcalg and fat contains about 9 kcalg Metabolic rate is estimated as the basal metabolic rate
BMR in endothermic animals at rest and as the standard metabolic rate SMR in ectotherms Human males
have a BMR of 1600 to 1800 kcalday and human females have a BMR of 1300 to 1500 kcalday Even with
insulation endothermal animals require extensive amounts of energy to maintain a constant body temperature
An ectotherm such as an alligator has an SMR of 60 kcalday
Energy Requirements Related to Body Size
Smaller endothermic animals have a greater surface area for their mass than larger ones Figure 334
Therefore smaller animals lose heat at a faster rate than larger animals and require more energy to maintain
a constant internal temperature This results in a smaller endothermic animal having a higher BMR per body
weight than a larger endothermic animal
