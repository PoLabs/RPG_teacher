KEY TERMS
heritable trait or behavior in an organism that aids in its survival and reproduction in its present
environment
speciation when one species radiates to form several other species
speciation that occurs via geographic separation
polyploidy formed between two related but separate species
condition of a cell having an extra chromosome or missing a chromosome for its species
polyploidy formed within a single species
type of reproductive isolation that occurs when a specific behavior or lack of one prevents
reproduction from taking place
process by which groups of organisms independently evolve to similar forms
allopatric speciation that occurs when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area
process by which groups of organisms evolve in diverse directions from a common point
prezygotic barrier occurring when closely related individuals of different species mate but
differences in their gamete cells eggs and sperm prevent fertilization from taking place
model that shows how species diverge gradually over time in small steps
reproductive isolation resulting when species populations move or are moved to a new
habitat taking up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the same species other populations
parallel structures in diverse organisms that have a common ancestor
offspring of two closely related individuals not of the same species
area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce forming hybrids
reproduction of individuals with favorable genetic traits that survive environmental change
because of those traits leading to evolutionary change
reproductive isolation mechanism that occurs after zygote formation
reproductive isolation mechanism that occurs before zygote formation
model for rapid speciation that can occur when an event causes a small portion of a
population to be cut off from the rest of the population
continued speciation divergence between two related species due to low fitness of hybrids
between them
situation that occurs when a species is reproductively independent from other species
behavior location or reproductive barriers may cause this to happen
formation of a new species
group of populations that interbreed and produce fertile offspring
speciation that occurs in the same geographic space
differences in breeding schedules that can act as a form of prezygotic barrier leading to
reproductive isolation
