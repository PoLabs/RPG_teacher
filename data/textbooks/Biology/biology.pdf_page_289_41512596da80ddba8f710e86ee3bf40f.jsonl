Introduction
A human like every sexually reproducing organism begins life as a fertilized egg embryo or zygote In our
species billions of cell divisions subsequently must occur in a controlled manner in order to produce a complex
multicellular human comprising trillions of cells Thus the original singlecelled zygote is literally the ancestor
of all cells in the body However once a human is fully grown cell reproduction is still necessary to repair and
regenerate tissues and sometimes to increase our size In fact all multicellular organisms use cell division for
growth and the maintenance and repair of cells and tissues Cell division is closely regulated and the occasional
failure of this regulation can have lifethreatening consequences Singlecelled organisms may also use cell
division as their method of reproduction
101  Cell Division
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes

Distinguish between chromosomes genes and traits

Describe the mechanisms of chromosome compaction
The continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell
cycle The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cells life from the division
of a single parent cell to the production of two new genetically identical daughter cells
