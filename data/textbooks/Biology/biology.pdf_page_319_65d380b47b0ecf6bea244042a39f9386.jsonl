synapsis the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other
The synaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between homologous nonsister
chromatidsa process called crossing over Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as
chiasmata singular  chiasma Figure 112
In humans even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not completely homologous that is most of their
genes differ there is a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during
prophase I A partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of homology
Figure 112 Early in prophase I homologous chromosomes come together to form a synapse The chromosomes are
bound tightly together and in perfect alignment by a protein lattice called a synaptonemal complex and by cohesin
proteins at the centromere
Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination
nodules These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of
crossoveror genetic recombinationbetween the nonsister chromatids Near the recombination nodule the
doublestranded DNA of each chromatid is cleaved the cut ends are modified and a new connection is made
between the nonsister chromatids As prophase I progresses the synaptonemal complex begins to break
down and the chromosomes begin to condense When the synaptonemal complex is gone the homologous
chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata The chiasmata remain until
anaphase I The number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length of the chromosome
There must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during
meiosis I but there may be as many as 25 Following crossover the synaptonemal complex breaks down and
the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is removed At the end of prophase I the pairs are held
together only at the chiasmata Figure 113 These pairs are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids
of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible
The crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis A single
crossover event between homologous nonsister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA
between a maternal chromosome and a paternal chromosome When a recombinant sister chromatid is moved
into a gamete cell it will carry some DNA from one parent and some DNA from the other parent The recombinant
chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist before the crossover Crossover
events can occur almost anywhere along the length of the synapsed chromosomes Different cells undergoing
meiosis will therefore produce different recombinant chromatids with varying combinations of maternal and
parental genes Multiple crossovers in an arm of the chromosome have the same effect exchanging segments
of DNA to produce genetically recombined chromosomes
