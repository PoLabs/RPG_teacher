Figure 79 In the citric acid cycle the acetyl group from acetyl CoA is attached to a fourcarbon oxaloacetate molecule
to form a sixcarbon citrate molecule Through a series of steps citrate is oxidized releasing two carbon dioxide
molecules for each acetyl group fed into the cycle In the process three NAD molecules are reduced to NADH one
FAD molecule is reduced to FADH2 and one ATP or GTP depending on the cell type is produced by substratelevel
phosphorylation Because the final product of the citric acid cycle is also the first reactant the cycle runs continuously

Steps in the Citric Acid Cycle
Step 1 Prior to the first step a transitional phase occurs during which pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl CoA
Then the first step of the cycle begins This condensation step combines the twocarbon acetyl group with a
fourcarbon oxaloacetate molecule to form a sixcarbon molecule of citrate CoA is bound to a sulfhydryl group
SH and diffuses away to eventually combine with another acetyl group This step is irreversible because it is
highly exergonic The rate of this reaction is controlled by negative feedback and the amount of ATP available If
ATP levels increase the rate of this reaction decreases If ATP is in short supply the rate increases
Step 2 In step two citrate loses one water molecule and gains another as citrate is converted into its isomer
isocitrate
Step 3 In step three isocitrate is oxidized producing a fivecarbon molecule ketoglutarate along with a
molecule of CO2 and two electrons which reduce NAD to NADH This step is also regulated by negative
feedback from ATP and NADH and a positive effect of ADP
Step 4 Steps three and four are both oxidation and decarboxylation steps which as we have seen release
