Pheromones
A pheromone is a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or physiology of animals
of the same species Pheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them but
pheromones apparently are not consciously perceived in the same way as other odors There are several
different types of pheromones which are released in urine or as glandular secretions Certain pheromones
are attractants to potential mates others are repellants to potential competitors of the same sex and still
others play roles in motherinfant attachment Some pheromones can also influence the timing of puberty
modify reproductive cycles and even prevent embryonic implantation While the roles of pheromones in
many nonhuman species are important pheromones have become less important in human behavior over
evolutionary time compared to their importance to organisms with more limited behavioral repertoires
The vomeronasal organ VNO or Jacobsons organ is a tubular fluidfilled olfactory organ present in many
vertebrate animals that sits adjacent to the nasal cavity It is very sensitive to pheromones and is connected
to the nasal cavity by a duct When molecules dissolve in the mucosa of the nasal cavity they then enter
the VNO where the pheromone molecules among them bind with specialized pheromone receptors Upon
exposure to pheromones from their own species or others many animals including cats may display the
flehmen response shown in Figure 369 a curling of the upper lip that helps pheromone molecules enter
the VNO
Pheromonal signals are sent not to the main olfactory bulb but to a different neural structure that projects
directly to the amygdala recall that the amygdala is a brain center important in emotional reactions such
as fear The pheromonal signal then continues to areas of the hypothalamus that are key to reproductive
physiology and behavior While some scientists assert that the VNO is apparently functionally vestigial in
humans even though there is a similar structure located near human nasal cavities others are researching
it as a possible functional system that may for example contribute to synchronization of menstrual cycles
in women living in close proximity

Taste
Detecting a taste gustation is fairly similar to detecting an odor olfaction given that both taste and smell
rely on chemical receptors being stimulated by certain molecules The primary organ of taste is the taste bud
A taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors taste cells that are located within the bumps on the tongue
called papillae singular papilla illustrated in Figure 3611 There are several structurally distinct papillae
Filiform papillae which are located across the tongue are tactile providing friction that helps the tongue move
substances and contain no taste cells In contrast fungiform papillae which are located mainly on the anterior
twothirds of the tongue each contain one to eight taste buds and also have receptors for pressure and
temperature The large circumvallate papillae contain up to 100 taste buds and form a V near the posterior
margin of the tongue
