Figure 3210 This series of micrographs shows male and female gymnosperm gametophytes a This male cone
shown in cross section has approximately 20 microsporophylls each of which produces hundreds of male
gametophytes pollen grains b Pollen grains are visible in this single microsporophyll c This micrograph shows an
individual pollen grain d This cross section of a female cone shows portions of about 15 megasporophylls e The
ovule can be seen in this single megasporophyll f Within this single ovule are the megaspore mother cell MMC

Reproductive Process
Upon landing on the female cone the tube cell of the pollen forms the pollen tube through which the generative
cell migrates towards the female gametophyte through the micropyle It takes approximately one year for
the pollen tube to grow and migrate towards the female gametophyte The male gametophyte containing the
generative cell splits into two sperm nuclei one of which fuses with the egg while the other degenerates After
fertilization of the egg the diploid zygote is formed which divides by mitosis to form the embryo The scales of
the cones are closed during development of the seed The seed is covered by a seed coat which is derived
from the female sporophyte Seed development takes another one to two years Once the seed is ready to be
dispersed the bracts of the female cones open to allow the dispersal of seed no fruit formation takes place
because gymnosperm seeds have no covering
Angiosperms versus Gymnosperms
Gymnosperm reproduction differs from that of angiosperms in several ways Figure 3211 In angiosperms the
female gametophyte exists in an enclosed structurethe ovulewhich is within the ovary in gymnosperms
the female gametophyte is present on exposed bracts of the female cone Double fertilization is a key event
in the lifecycle of angiosperms but is completely absent in gymnosperms The male and female gametophyte
structures are present on separate male and female cones in gymnosperms whereas in angiosperms they are
a part of the flower Lastly wind plays an important role in pollination in gymnosperms because pollen is blown by
the wind to land on the female cones Although many angiosperms are also windpollinated animal pollination
is more common
