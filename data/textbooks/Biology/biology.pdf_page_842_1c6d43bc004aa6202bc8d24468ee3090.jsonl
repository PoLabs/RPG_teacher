Subphylum Myriapoda
Subphylum Myriapoda comprises arthropods with numerous legs Although the name is misleading suggesting
that thousands of legs are present in these invertebrates the number of legs typically varies from 10 to 750
This subphylum includes 16000 species the most commonly found examples are millipedes and centipedes
Virtually all myriapods are terrestrial animals and prefer a humid environment Ancient myriapods or myriapod
like arthropods from the Silurian to the Devonian grew up to 10 feet in length three meters Unfortunately they
are all extinct
Myriapods are typically found in moist soils decaying biological material and leaf litter Subphylum Myriapoda
is divided into four classes Chilopoda Symphyla Diplopoda and Pauropoda Centipedes like Scutigera
coleoptrata Figure 2840 are classified as chilopods These animals bear one pair of legs per segment
mandibles as mouthparts and are somewhat dorsoventrally flattened The legs in the first segment are modified
to form forcipules poison claws that deliver poison to prey like spiders and cockroaches as these animals
are all predatory Symphyla are similar to centipedes but lack the poison claws and are vegetarian Millipedes
bear two pairs of legs per diplosegmenta feature that results from the embryonic fusion of adjacent pairs of
body segments These arthropods are usually rounder in crosssection than centipedes and are herbivores or
detritivores Millipedes have visibly more numbers of legs as compared to centipedes although they do not have
a thousand legs Figure 2840b The Pauropods are similar to millipedes but have fewer segments
Figure 2840 Myriapods The centipede Scutigera coleoptrata a has up to 15 pairs of legs The North American
millipede Narceus americanus b bears many legs although not a thousand as its name might suggest credit a

Subphylum Crustacea
Crustaceans are the most dominant aquatic both freshwater and marine arthropods with the total number of
marine crustaceans standing at about 70000 species Krill shrimp lobsters crabs and crayfish are examples
of crustaceans Figure 2841 However there are also a number of terrestrial crustacean species as well
Terrestrial species like the wood lice Armadillidium spp also called pill bugs rolypolies potato bugs or
isopods are also crustaceans Nonetheless the number of terrestrial species in this subphylum is relatively low
