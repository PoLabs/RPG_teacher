the proportion of round and yellow F2 offspring is expected to be 34  34  916 and the proportion of
wrinkled and green offspring is expected to be 14  14  116 These proportions are identical to those
obtained using a Punnett square Round green and wrinkled yellow offspring can also be calculated using the
product rule as each of these genotypes includes one dominant and one recessive phenotype Therefore the
proportion of each is calculated as 34  14  316
The law of independent assortment also indicates that a cross between yellow wrinkled YYrr and green round
yyRR parents would yield the same F1 and F2 offspring as in the YYRR x yyrr cross
The physical basis for the law of independent assortment also lies in meiosis I in which the different homologous
pairs line up in random orientations Each gamete can contain any combination of paternal and maternal
chromosomes and therefore the genes on them because the orientation of tetrads on the metaphase plane is
random
ForkedLine Method
When more than two genes are being considered the Punnettsquare method becomes unwieldy For instance
examining a cross involving four genes would require a 16  16 grid containing 256 boxes It would be extremely
cumbersome to manually enter each genotype For more complex crosses the forkedline and probability
methods are preferred
To prepare a forkedline diagram for a cross between F1 heterozygotes resulting from a cross between AABBCC
and aabbcc parents we first create rows equal to the number of genes being considered and then segregate
the alleles in each row on forked lines according to the probabilities for individual monohybrid crosses Figure
1217 We then multiply the values along each forked path to obtain the F2 offspring probabilities Note that this
process is a diagrammatic version of the product rule The values along each forked pathway can be multiplied
because each gene assorts independently For a trihybrid cross the F2 phenotypic ratio is 279993331
Figure 1217 The forkedline method can be used to analyze a trihybrid cross Here the probability for color in the
F2 generation occupies the top row 3 yellow1 green The probability for shape occupies the second row 3 round
1 wrinkled and the probability for height occupies the third row 3 tall1 dwarf The probability for each possible
combination of traits is calculated by multiplying the probability for each individual trait Thus the probability of F2
offspring having yellow round and tall traits is 3  3  3 or 27
Probability Method
While the forkedline method is a diagrammatic approach to keeping track of probabilities in a cross the
probability method gives the proportions of offspring expected to exhibit each phenotype or genotype without
the added visual assistance Both methods make use of the product rule and consider the alleles for each gene
separately Earlier we examined the phenotypic proportions for a trihybrid cross using the forkedline method
now we will use the probability method to examine the genotypic proportions for a cross with even more genes
For a trihybrid cross writing out the forkedline method is tedious albeit not as tedious as using the Punnett
square method To fully demonstrate the power of the probability method however we can consider specific
genetic calculations For instance for a tetrahybrid cross between individuals that are heterozygotes for all four
genes and in which all four genes are sorting independently and in a dominant and recessive pattern what
proportion of the offspring will be expected to be homozygous recessive for all four alleles Rather than writing
out every possible genotype we can use the probability method We know that for each gene the fraction of
homozygous recessive offspring will be 14 Therefore multiplying this fraction for each of the four genes 14
 14  14  14 we determine that 1256 of the offspring will be quadruply homozygous recessive
For the same tetrahybrid cross what is the expected proportion of offspring that have the dominant phenotype
