Leaf Adaptations
Coniferous plant species that thrive in cold environments like spruce fir and pine have leaves that are reduced
in size and needlelike in appearance These needlelike leaves have sunken stomata and a smaller surface
area two attributes that aid in reducing water loss In hot climates plants such as cacti have leaves that are
reduced to spines which in combination with their succulent stems help to conserve water Many aquatic plants
have leaves with wide lamina that can float on the surface of the water and a thick waxy cuticle on the leaf
surface that repels water
