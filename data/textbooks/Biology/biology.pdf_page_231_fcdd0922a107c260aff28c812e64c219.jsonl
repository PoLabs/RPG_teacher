presence of the negatively charged phosphate in the molecule also prevents the sugar from leaving the cell
When hexokinase is inhibited glucose diffuses out of the cell and does not become a substrate for the respiration
pathways in that tissue The product of the hexokinase reaction is glucose6phosphate which accumulates
when a later enzyme phosphofructokinase is inhibited
Figure 719 The glycolysis pathway is primarily regulated at the three key enzymatic steps 1 2 and 7 as indicated
Note that the first two steps that are regulated occur early in the pathway and involve hydrolysis of ATP
Phosphofructokinase is the main enzyme controlled in glycolysis High levels of ATP or citrate or a lower more
acidic pH decreases the enzymes activity An increase in citrate concentration can occur because of a blockage
in the citric acid cycle Fermentation with its production of organic acids such as lactic acid frequently accounts
for the increased acidity in a cell however the products of fermentation do not typically accumulate in cells
The last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase The pyruvate produced can proceed to be catabolized
or converted into the amino acid alanine If no more energy is needed and alanine is in adequate supply the
enzyme is inhibited The enzymes activity is increased when fructose16bisphosphate levels increase Recall
that fructose16bisphosphate is an intermediate in the first half of glycolysis The regulation of pyruvate kinase
involves phosphorylation by a kinase pyruvate kinase resulting in a lessactive enzyme Dephosphorylation by
a phosphatase reactivates it Pyruvate kinase is also regulated by ATP a negative allosteric effect
If more energy is needed more pyruvate will be converted into acetyl CoA through the action of pyruvate
dehydrogenase If either acetyl groups or NADH accumulates there is less need for the reaction and the rate
decreases Pyruvate dehydrogenase is also regulated by phosphorylation a kinase phosphorylates it to form an
inactive enzyme and a phosphatase reactivates it The kinase and the phosphatase are also regulated
Citric Acid Cycle
The citric acid cycle is controlled through the enzymes that catalyze the reactions that make the first two
molecules of NADH Figure 79 These enzymes are isocitrate dehydrogenase and ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase When adequate ATP and NADH levels are available the rates of these reactions decrease
When more ATP is needed as reflected in rising ADP levels the rate increases Alphaketoglutarate
dehydrogenase will also be affected by the levels of succinyl CoAa subsequent intermediate in the
cyclecausing a decrease in activity A decrease in the rate of operation of the pathway at this point is not
necessarily negative as the increased levels of the ketoglutarate not used by the citric acid cycle can be used
by the cell for amino acid glutamate synthesis
Electron Transport Chain
Specific enzymes of the electron transport chain are unaffected by feedback inhibition but the rate of electron
transport through the pathway is affected by the levels of ADP and ATP Greater ATP consumption by a cell is
indicated by a buildup of ADP As ATP usage decreases the concentration of ADP decreases and now ATP
