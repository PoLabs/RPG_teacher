Figure 124 In the P generation pea plants that are truebreeding for the dominant yellow phenotype are crossed with
plants with the recessive green phenotype This cross produces F1 heterozygotes with a yellow phenotype Punnett
square analysis can be used to predict the genotypes of the F2 generation
A selfcross of one of the Yy heterozygous offspring can be represented in a 2  2 Punnett square because
each parent can donate one of two different alleles Therefore the offspring can potentially have one of
four allele combinations YY Yy yY or yy Figure 124 Notice that there are two ways to obtain the Yy
genotype a Y from the egg and a y from the sperm or a y from the egg and a Y from the sperm Both
of these possibilities must be counted Recall that Mendels peaplant characteristics behaved in the same
way in reciprocal crosses Therefore the two possible heterozygous combinations produce offspring that are
genotypically and phenotypically identical despite their dominant and recessive alleles deriving from different
parents They are grouped together Because fertilization is a random event we expect each combination to be
equally likely and for the offspring to exhibit a ratio of YYYyyy genotypes of 121 Figure 124 Furthermore
because the YY and Yy offspring have yellow seeds and are phenotypically identical applying the sum rule
of probability we expect the offspring to exhibit a phenotypic ratio of 3 yellow1 green Indeed working with
large sample sizes Mendel observed approximately this ratio in every F2 generation resulting from crosses for
individual traits
Mendel validated these results by performing an F3 cross in which he selfcrossed the dominant and recessive
expressing F2 plants When he selfcrossed the plants expressing green seeds all of the offspring had green
seeds confirming that all green seeds had homozygous genotypes of yy When he selfcrossed the F2 plants
expressing yellow seeds he found that onethird of the plants bred true and twothirds of the plants segregated
at a 31 ratio of yellowgreen seeds In this case the truebreeding plants had homozygous YY genotypes
whereas the segregating plants corresponded to the heterozygous Yy genotype When these plants self
fertilized the outcome was just like the F1 selffertilizing cross
The Test Cross Distinguishes the Dominant Phenotype
Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents Mendel also
