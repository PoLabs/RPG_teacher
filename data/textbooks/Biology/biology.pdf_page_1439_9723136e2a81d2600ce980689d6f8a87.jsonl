to the onechild policy in China which is now being phased out India also implements national and regional
populations to encourage family planning On the other hand Japan Spain Russia Iran and other countries
have made efforts to increase population growth after birth rates dipped Such policies are controversial and the
human population continues to grow At some point the food supply may run out but the outcomes are difficult
to predict The United Nations estimates that future world population growth may vary from 6 billion a decrease
to 16 billion people by the year 2100
Another result of population growth is the endangerment of the natural environment Many countries have
attempted to reduce the human impact on climate change by reducing their emission of the greenhouse gas
carbon dioxide However these treaties have not been ratified by every country The role of human activity in
causing climate change has become a hotly debated sociopolitical issue in some countries including the United
States Thus we enter the future with considerable uncertainty about our ability to curb human population growth
and protect our environment

456  Community Ecology
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the predatorprey cycle

Give examples of defenses against predation and herbivory

Describe the competitive exclusion principle

Give examples of symbiotic relationships between species

Describe community structure and succession
Populations rarely if ever live in isolation from populations of other species In most cases numerous species
share a habitat The interactions between these populations play a major role in regulating population growth
and abundance All populations occupying the same habitat form a community populations inhabiting a specific
area at the same time The number of species occupying the same habitat and their relative abundance is known
as species diversity Areas with low diversity such as the glaciers of Antarctica still contain a wide variety of
living things whereas the diversity of tropical rainforests is so great that it cannot be counted Ecology is studied
at the community level to understand how species interact with each other and compete for the same resources
Predation and Herbivory
Perhaps the classical example of species interaction is predation the consumption of prey by its predator Nature
shows on television highlight the drama of one living organism killing another Populations of predators and prey
in a community are not constant over time in most cases they vary in cycles that appear to be related The most
often cited example of predatorprey dynamics is seen in the cycling of the lynx predator and the snowshoe
hare prey using nearly 200 yearold trapping data from North American forests Figure 4518 This cycle of
predator and prey lasts approximately 10 years with the predator population lagging 12 years behind that of
the prey population As the hare numbers increase there is more food available for the lynx allowing the lynx
population to increase as well When the lynx population grows to a threshold level however they kill so many
hares that hare population begins to decline followed by a decline in the lynx population because of scarcity of
food When the lynx population is low the hare population size begins to increase due at least in part to low
predation pressure starting the cycle anew
