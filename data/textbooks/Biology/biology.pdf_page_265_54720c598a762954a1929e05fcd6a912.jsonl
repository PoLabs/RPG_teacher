Types of Receptors
Receptors are protein molecules in the target cell or on its surface that bind ligand There are two types of
receptors internal receptors and cellsurface receptors
Internal receptors
Internal receptors also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors are found in the cytoplasm of the cell
and respond to hydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane Once inside
the cell many of these molecules bind to proteins that act as regulators of mRNA synthesis transcription to
mediate gene expression Gene expression is the cellular process of transforming the information in a cells DNA
into a sequence of amino acids which ultimately forms a protein When the ligand binds to the internal receptor a
conformational change is triggered that exposes a DNAbinding site on the protein The ligandreceptor complex
moves into the nucleus then binds to specific regulatory regions of the chromosomal DNA and promotes the
initiation of transcription Figure 94 Transcription is the process of copying the information in a cells DNA into
a special form of RNA called messenger RNA mRNA the cell uses information in the mRNA which moves out
into the cytoplasm and associates with ribosomes to link specific amino acids in the correct order producing a
protein Internal receptors can directly influence gene expression without having to pass the signal on to other
receptors or messengers
Figure 94 Hydrophobic signaling molecules typically diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with
intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm Many intracellular receptors are transcription factors that interact with DNA in
the nucleus and regulate gene expression
CellSurface Receptors
Cellsurface receptors also known as transmembrane receptors are cell surface membraneanchored
integral proteins that bind to external ligand molecules This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane
and performs signal transduction through which an extracellular signal is converted into an intracellular signal
Ligands that interact with cellsurface receptors do not have to enter the cell that they affect Cellsurface
receptors are also called cellspecific proteins or markers because they are specific to individual cell types
Because cellsurface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning it should come as no surprise
that a malfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences Errors in the protein structures
of certain receptor molecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension high blood pressure asthma
heart disease and cancer
Each cellsurface receptor has three main components an external ligandbinding domain a hydrophobic
membranespanning region called a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain inside the cell The
ligandbinding domain is also called the extracellular domain The size and extent of each of these domains
vary widely depending on the type of receptor
