Figure 317 Alphalinolenic acid is an example of an omega3 fatty acid It has three cis double bonds and as a result
a curved shape For clarity the diagram does not show the carbons Each singly bonded carbon has two hydrogens
associated with it which the diagram also does not show
The farthest carbon away from the carboxyl group is numbered as the omega  carbon and if the double
bond is between the third and fourth carbon from that end it is an omega3 fatty acid Nutritionally important
because the body does not make them omega3 fatty acids include alphalinoleic acid ALA eicosapentaenoic
acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA all of which are polyunsaturated Salmon trout and tuna are
good sources of omega3 fatty acids Research indicates that omega3 fatty acids reduce the risk of sudden
death from heart attacks lower triglycerides in the blood decrease blood pressure and prevent thrombosis by
inhibiting blood clotting They also reduce inflammation and may help lower the risk of some cancers in animals
Like carbohydrates fats have received considerable bad publicity It is true that eating an excess of fried foods
and other fatty foods leads to weight gain However fats do have important functions Many vitamins are
fat soluble and fats serve as a longterm storage form of fatty acids a source of energy They also provide
insulation for the body Therefore we should consume healthy fats in moderate amounts on a regular basis
Waxes
Wax covers some aquatic birds feathers and some plants leaf surfaces Because of waxes hydrophobic nature
they prevent water from sticking on the surface Figure 318 Long fatty acid chains esterified to longchain
alcohols comprise waxes

Phospholipids
Phospholipids are major plasma membrane constituents that comprise cells outermost layer Like fats they
are comprised of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone However instead of three
fatty acids attached as in triglycerides there are two fatty acids forming diacylglycerol and a modified phosphate
