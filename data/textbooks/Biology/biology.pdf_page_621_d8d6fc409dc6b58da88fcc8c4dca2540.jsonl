Figure 2221 The Black Death The a Great Plague of London killed an estimated 200000 people or about 20
percent of the citys population The causative agent the b bacterium Yersinia pestis is a Gramnegative rodshaped
bacterium from the class Gammaproteobacteria The disease is transmitted through the bite of an infected flea which
is carried on a rodent Symptoms include swollen lymph nodes fever seizure vomiting of blood and c gangrene

Migration of Diseases to New Populations
One of the negative consequences of human exploration was the accidental biological warfare that resulted
from the transport of a pathogen into a population that had not previously been exposed to it Over the centuries
Europeans tended to develop genetic immunity to endemic infectious diseases but when European conquerors
reached the western hemisphere they brought with them diseasecausing bacteria and viruses which triggered
epidemics that completely devastated many diverse populations of Native Americans who had no natural
resistance to many European diseases It has been estimated that up to 90 percent of Native Americans
died from infectious diseases after the arrival of Europeans making conquest of the New World a foregone
conclusion
Emerging and Reemerging Diseases
The distribution of a particular disease is dynamic Changes in the environment the pathogen or the host
population can dramatically impact the spread of a disease According to the World Health Organization WHO
an emerging disease Figure 2222 is one that has appeared in a population for the first time or that may have
existed previously but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range This definition also includes re
emerging diseases that were previously under control Approximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious
diseases affecting humans are zoonotic diseases Zoonoses are diseases that primarily infect animals but can
be transmitted to humans some are of viral origin and some are of bacterial origin Brucellosis is an example of
a prokaryotic zoonosis that is reemerging in some regions and necrotizing fasciitis commonly known as flesh
eating bacteria has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years for unknown reasons
