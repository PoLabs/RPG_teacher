mRNA degradation can all occur simultaneously The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be
amplified by multiple transcription and translation events that occur concurrently on the same DNA template
Prokaryotic genomes are very compact and prokaryotic transcripts often cover more than one gene or cistron a
coding sequence for a single protein Polycistronic mRNAs are then translated to produce more than one kind
of protein
Our discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process in Escherichia coli a wellstudied
eubacterial species Although some differences exist between transcription in E coli and transcription in
archaea an understanding of E coli transcription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species
Prokaryotic RNA Polymerase
Prokaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes In E coli the polymerase is
composed of five polypeptide subunits two of which are identical Four of these subunits denoted    and
 comprise the polymerase core enzyme These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed and they
disassemble once transcription is complete Each subunit has a unique role the two subunits are necessary to
assemble the polymerase on the DNA the subunit binds to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become
part of the nascent mRNA molecule and the  subunit binds the DNA template strand The fifth subunit  is
involved only in transcription initiation It confers transcriptional specificity such that the polymerase begins to
synthesize mRNA from an appropriate initiation site Without  the core enzyme would transcribe from random
sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish The polymerase comprised of all five
subunits is called the holoenzyme
Prokaryotic Promoters
A promoter is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery including RNA polymerase binds
and initiates transcription In most cases promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate The specific
sequence of a promoter is very important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed
all the time some of the time or infrequently Although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes a few
elements are evolutionarily conserved in many species At the 10 and 35 regions upstream of the initiation
site there are two promoter consensus sequences or regions that are similar across all promoters and
across various bacterial species Figure 158 The 10 sequence called the 10 region has the consensus
sequence TATAAT The 35 sequence has the consensus sequence TTGACA These consensus sequences
are recognized and bound by  Once this interaction is made the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the
site The ATrich 10 region facilitates unwinding of the DNA template and several phosphodiester bonds are
made The transcription initiation phase ends with the production of abortive transcripts which are polymers of
approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released
Figure 158 The  subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter
region upstream of the transcription start site The  subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription has
been initiated
