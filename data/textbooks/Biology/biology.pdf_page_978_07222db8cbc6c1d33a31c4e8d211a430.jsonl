CHAPTER SUMMARY
311 Nutritional Requirements of Plants
Plants can absorb inorganic nutrients and water through their root system and carbon dioxide from the
environment The combination of organic compounds along with water carbon dioxide and sunlight produce
the energy that allows plants to grow Inorganic compounds form the majority of the soil solution Plants access
water though the soil Water is absorbed by the plant root transports nutrients throughout the plant and
maintains the structure of the plant Essential elements are indispensable elements for plant growth They are
divided into macronutrients and micronutrients The macronutrients plants require are carbon nitrogen
hydrogen oxygen phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium and sulfur Important micronutrients include
iron manganese boron molybdenum copper zinc chlorine nickel cobalt silicon and sodium
312 The Soil
Plants obtain mineral nutrients from the soil Soil is the outer loose layer that covers the surface of Earth Soil
quality depends on the chemical composition of the soil the topography the presence of living organisms the
climate and time Agricultural practice and history may also modify the characteristics and fertility of soil Soil
consists of four major components 1 inorganic mineral matter 2 organic matter 3 water and air and 4 living
matter The organic material of soil is made of humus which improves soil structure and provides water and
minerals Soil inorganic material consists of rock slowly broken down into smaller particles that vary in size
such as sand silt and loam
Soil formation results from a combination of biological physical and chemical processes Soil is not
homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers called a soil profile Factors that affect
soil formation include parent material climate topography biological factors and time Soils are classified
based on their horizons soil particle size and proportions Most soils have four distinct horizons O A B and
C
313 Nutritional Adaptations of Plants
Atmospheric nitrogen is the largest pool of available nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems However plants cannot
use this nitrogen because they do not have the necessary enzymes Biological nitrogen fixation BNF is the
conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia The most important source of BNF is the symbiotic interaction
between soil bacteria and legumes The bacteria form nodules on the legumes roots in which nitrogen fixation
takes place Fungi form symbiotic associations mycorrhizae with plants becoming integrated into the physical
structure of the root Through mycorrhization the plant obtains minerals from the soil and the fungus obtains
photosynthate from the plant root Ectomycorrhizae form an extensive dense sheath around the root while
endomycorrhizae are embedded within the root tissue Some plantsparasites saprophytes symbionts
epiphytes and insectivoreshave evolved adaptations to obtain their organic or mineral nutrition from various
sources
