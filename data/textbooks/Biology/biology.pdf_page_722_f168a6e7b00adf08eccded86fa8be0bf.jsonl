Figure 2510 Liverwort gametophyte A liverwort Lunularia cruciata displays its lobate flat thallus The organism in
the photograph is in the gametophyte stage but has not yet produced gametangia Lunularia gametophytes produce
crescentshaped gemmae circled which contain asexual spores The tiny white dots on the surface of the thallus are
air pores
Openings in the thallus that allow the movement of gases may be observed in liverworts Figure 2510
However these are not stomata because they do not actively open and close by the action of guard cells
Instead the thallus takes up water over its entire surface and has no cuticle to prevent desiccation which
explains their preferred wet habitats Figure 2511 represents the lifecycle of a lobate liverwort Haploid spores
germinate into flattened thalli attached to the substrate by thin singlecelled filaments Stalklike structures
gametophores grow from the thallus and carry male and female gametangia which may develop on separate
individual plants or on the same plant depending on the species Flagellated male gametes develop within
antheridia male gametangia The female gametes develop within archegonia female gametangia Once
released the male gametes swim with the aid of their flagella to an archegonium and fertilization ensues
The zygote grows into a small sporophyte still contained in the archegonium The diploid zygote will give rise
by meiosis to the next generation of haploid spores which can be disseminated by wind or water In many
liverworts spore dispersal is facilitated by elaterslong single cells that suddenly change shape as they dry
out and throw adjacent spores out of the spore capsule Liverwort plants can also reproduce asexually by the
breaking of branches or the spreading of leaf fragments called gemmae In this latter type of reproduction the
gemmaesmall intact complete pieces of plant that are produced in a cup on the surface of the thallus shown
in Figure 2511 and Figure 2512are splashed out of the cup by raindrops The gemmae then land nearby
and develop into gametophytes
