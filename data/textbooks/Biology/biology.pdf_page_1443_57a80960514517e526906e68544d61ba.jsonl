Competitive Exclusion Principle
Resources are often limited within a habitat and multiple species may compete to obtain them All species have
an ecological niche in the ecosystem which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they
interact with other species in the community The competitive exclusion principle states that two species
cannot occupy the same niche in a habitat In other words different species cannot coexist in a community if
they are competing for all the same resources An example of this principle is shown in Figure 4524 with two
protozoan species Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum When grown individually in the laboratory
they both thrive But when they are placed together in the same test tube habitat P aurelia outcompetes P
caudatum for food leading to the latters eventual extinction
