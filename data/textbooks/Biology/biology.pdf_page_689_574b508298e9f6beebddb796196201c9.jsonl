ascus plural asci a saclike structure that contains haploid ascospores Filamentous ascomycetes produce
hyphae divided by perforated septa allowing streaming of cytoplasm from one cell to another Conidia and asci
which are used respectively for asexual and sexual reproduction are usually separated from the vegetative
hyphae by blocked nonperforated septa Many ascomycetes are of commercial importance Some play a
beneficial role for humanity such as the yeasts used in baking brewing and wine fermentation and directly as
food delicacies such as truffles and morels Aspergillus oryzae is used in the fermentation of rice to produce
sake Other ascomycetes parasitize plants and animals including humans For example fungal pneumonia
poses a significant threat to AIDS patients who have a compromised immune system Ascomycetes not only
infest and destroy crops directly they also produce poisonous secondary metabolites that make crops unfit for
consumption
Asexual reproduction is frequent and involves the production of conidiophores that release haploid
conidiospores Figure 2414 Sexual reproduction starts with the development of special hyphae from either
one of two types of mating strains Figure 2414 The male strain produces an antheridium and the female
strain develops an ascogonium At fertilization the antheridium and the ascogonium combine in plasmogamy
without nuclear fusion Special dikaryotic ascogenous ascusproducing hyphae arise from this dikaryon in
which each cell has pairs of nuclei one from the male strain and one from the female strain In each ascus
two haploid nuclei fuse in karyogamy Thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called the ascocarp The diploid
nucleus in each ascus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis and spore walls form around each nucleus The
spores in each ascus contain the meiotic products of a single diploid nucleus The ascospores are then released
germinate and form hyphae that are disseminated in the environment and start new mycelia Figure 2415
