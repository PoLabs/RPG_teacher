Temperate Grasslands
Temperate grasslands are found throughout central North America where they are also known as prairies
they are also in Eurasia where they are known as steppes Figure 4412 Temperate grasslands have
pronounced annual fluctuations in temperature with hot summers and cold winters The annual temperature
variation produces specific growing seasons for plants Plant growth is possible when temperatures are warm
enough to sustain plant growth and when ample water is available which occurs in the spring summer and fall
During much of the winter temperatures are low and water which is stored in the form of ice is not available for
plant growth
Annual precipitation ranges from 25 cm to 75 cm 98295 in Because of relatively lower annual precipitation in
temperate grasslands there are few trees except for those found growing along rivers or streams The dominant
vegetation tends to consist of grasses dense enough to sustain populations of grazing animals Figure 4417
The vegetation is very dense and the soils are fertile because the subsurface of the soil is packed with the
roots and rhizomes underground stems of these grasses The roots and rhizomes act to anchor plants into the
ground and replenish the organic material humus in the soil when they die and decay

populated American prairies in huge numbers credit Jack Dykinga USDA Agricultural Research Service
Fires mainly caused by lightning are a natural disturbance in temperate grasslands When fire is suppressed in
temperate grasslands the vegetation eventually converts to scrub and sometimes dense forests with drought
tolerant tree species Often the restoration or management of temperate grasslands requires the use of
controlled burns to suppress the growth of trees and maintain the grasses
Temperate Forests
Temperate forests are the most common biome in eastern North America Western Europe Eastern Asia
Chile and New Zealand Figure 4412 This biome is found throughout midlatitude regions Temperatures
