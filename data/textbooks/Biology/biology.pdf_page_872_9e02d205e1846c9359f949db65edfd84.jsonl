Characteristics of Amphibians
As tetrapods most amphibians are characterized by four welldeveloped limbs In some species of salamanders
hindlimbs are reduced or absent but all caecilians are secondarily limbless An important characteristic of
extant amphibians is a moist permeable skin that is achieved via mucus glands Most water is taken in across
the skin rather than by drinking The skin is also one of three respiratory surfaces used by amphibians The other
two are the lungs and the buccal mouth cavity Air is taken first into the mouth through the nostrils and then
pushed by positive pressure into the lungs by elevating the throat and closing the nostrils
All extant adult amphibians are carnivorous and some terrestrial amphibians have a sticky tongue used to
capture prey Amphibians also have multiple small teeth at the edge of the jaws In salamanders and caecilians
teeth are present in both jaws sometimes in multiple rows In frogs and toads teeth are seen only in the
upper jaw Additional teeth called vomerine teeth may be found in the roof of the mouth Amphibian teeth are
pedicellate which means that the root and crown are calcified separated by a zone of noncalcified tissue
Amphibians have imageforming eyes and color vision Ears are best developed in frogs and toads which
vocalize to communicate Frogs use separate regions of the inner ear for detecting higher and lower sounds the
papilla amphibiorum which is sensitive to frequencies below 10000 hertz and unique to amphibians and the
papilla basilaris which is sensitive to higher frequencies including mating calls transmitted from the eardrum
through the stapes bone Amphibians also have an extra bone in the ear the operculum which transmits low
frequency vibrations from the forelimbs and shoulders to the inner ear and may be used for the detection of
seismic signals
Evolution of Amphibians
The fossil record provides evidence of the first tetrapods nowextinct amphibian species dating to nearly 400
million years ago Evolution of tetrapods from lobefinned freshwater fishes similar to coelacanths and lungfish
represented a significant change in body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water
to organisms that breathed air and moved onto land these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years
during the Devonian period
Aquatic tetrapods of the Devonian period include Ichthyostega and Acanthostega Both were aquatic and may
have had both gills and lungs They also had four limbs with the skeletal structure of limbs found in presentday
tetrapods including amphibians However the limbs could not be pulled in under the body and would not have
supported their bodies well out of water They probably lived in shallow freshwater environments and may have
taken brief terrestrial excursions much like walking catfish do today in Florida In Ichthyostega the forelimbs
were more developed than the hind limbs so it might have dragged itself along when it ventured onto land What
preceded Acanthostega and Ichthyostega
In 2006 researchers published news of their discovery of a fossil of a tetrapodlike fish Tiktaalik roseae which
seems to be a morphologically intermediate form between sarcopterygian fishes having feetlike fins and early
tetrapods having true limbs Figure 2917 Tiktaalik likely lived in a shallow water environment about 375 million
years ago

Tiktaalik also had gills and lungs but the loss of some gill elements gave it a neck which would have
allowed its head to move sideways for feeding The eyes were on top of the head It had fins but the attachment
of the fin bones to the shoulder suggested they might be weightbearing Tiktaalik preceded Acanthostega and
Ichthyostega with their four limbs by about 10 million years and is considered to be a true intermediate clade
between fish and amphibians
