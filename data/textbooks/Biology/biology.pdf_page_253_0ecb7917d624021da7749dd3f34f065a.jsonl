Figure 819 The harsh conditions of the desert have led plants like these cacti to evolve variations of the light
independent reactions of photosynthesis These variations increase the efficiency of water usage helping to conserve
water and energy credit Piotr Wojtkowski
The Energy Cycle
Whether the organism is a bacterium plant or animal all living things access energy by breaking down
carbohydrate and other carbonrich organic molecules But if plants make carbohydrate molecules why would
they need to break them down especially when it has been shown that the gas organisms release as a waste
product CO2 acts as a substrate for the formation of more food in photosynthesis Remember living things
need energy to perform life functions In addition an organism can either make its own food or eat another
organismeither way the food still needs to be broken down Finally in the process of breaking down food
called cellular respiration heterotrophs release needed energy and produce waste in the form of CO2 gas
However in nature there is no such thing as waste Every single atom of matter and energy is conserved
recycled over and over infinitely Substances change form or move from one type of molecule to another but
their constituent atoms never disappear Figure 820
In reality CO2 is no more a form of waste than oxygen is wasteful to photosynthesis Both are byproducts
of reactions that move on to other reactions Photosynthesis absorbs light energy to build carbohydrates in
chloroplasts and aerobic cellular respiration releases energy by using oxygen to metabolize carbohydrates in
the cytoplasm and mitochondria Both processes use electron transport chains to capture the energy necessary
to drive other reactions These two powerhouse processes photosynthesis and cellular respiration function in
biological cyclical harmony to allow organisms to access lifesustaining energy that originates millions of miles
away in a burning star humans call the sun
