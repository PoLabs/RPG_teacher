H erectus appeared approximately 18 million years ago Figure 2949 It is believed to have originated in East
Africa and was the first hominin species to migrate out of Africa Fossils of H erectus have been found in India
China Java and Europe and were known in the past as Java Man or Peking Man H erectus had a number
of features that were more similar to modern humans than those of H habilis H erectus was larger in size than
earlier hominins reaching heights up to 185 meters and weighing up to 65 kilograms which are sizes similar to
those of modern humans Its degree of sexual dimorphism was less than in earlier species with males being 20
to 30 percent larger than females which is close to the size difference seen in our own species H erectus had
a larger brain than earlier species at 775 to 1100 cubic centimeters which compares to the 1130 to 1260 cubic
centimeters seen in modern human brains H erectus also had a nose with downwardfacing nostrils similar
to modern humans rather than the forwardfacing nostrils found in other primates Longer downwardfacing
nostrils allow for the warming of cold air before it enters the lungs and may have been an adaptation to colder
climates Artifacts found with fossils of H erectus suggest that it was the first hominin to use fire hunt and have
a home base H erectus is generally thought to have lived until about 50000 years ago
Figure 2949 Homo erectus Homo erectus had a prominent brow and a nose that pointed downward rather than
forward
Humans Homo sapiens
A number of species sometimes called archaic Homo sapiens apparently evolved from H erectus starting
about 500000 years ago These species include Homo heidelbergensis Homo rhodesiensis and Homo
neanderthalensis These archaic H sapiens had a brain size similar to that of modern humans averaging 1200
to 1400 cubic centimeters They differed from modern humans by having a thick skull a prominent brow ridge
and a receding chin Some of these species survived until 30000 to 10000 years ago overlapping with modern
humans Figure 2950
