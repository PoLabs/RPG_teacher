Are Designer Babies in Our Future
Figure 4327 This logo from the Second International Eugenics Conference in New York City in September of
1921 shows how eugenics attempted to merge several fields of study with the goal of producing a genetically
superior human race
If you could prevent your child from getting a devastating genetic disease would you do it Would you select
the sex of your child or select for their attractiveness strength or intelligence How far would you go to
maximize the possibility of resistance to disease The genetic engineering of a human child the production
of designer babies with desirable phenotypic characteristics was once a topic restricted to science fiction
This is the case no longer science fiction is now overlapping into science fact Many phenotypic choices
for offspring are already available with many more likely to be possible in the not too distant future Which
traits should be selected and how they should be selected are topics of much debate within the worldwide
medical community The ethical and moral line is not always clear or agreed upon and some fear that
modern reproductive technologies could lead to a new form of eugenics
Eugenics is the use of information and technology from a variety of sources to improve the genetic
makeup of the human race The goal of creating genetically superior humans was quite prevalent although
controversial in several countries during the early 20th century but fell into disrepute when Nazi Germany
developed an extensive eugenics program in the 1930s and 40s As part of their program the Nazis
forcibly sterilized hundreds of thousands of the socalled unfit and killed tens of thousands of institutionally
disabled people as part of a systematic program to develop a genetically superior race of Germans known
as Aryans Ever since eugenic ideas have not been as publicly expressed but there are still those who
promote them
Efforts have been made in the past to control traits in human children using donated sperm from men with
desired traits In fact eugenicist Robert Klark Graham established a sperm bank in 1980 that included
samples exclusively from donors with high IQs The genius sperm bank failed to capture the publics
imagination and the operation closed in 1999
In more recent times the procedure known as prenatal genetic diagnosis PGD has been developed PGD
involves the screening of human embryos as part of the process of in vitro fertilization during which embryos
are conceived and grown outside the mothers body for some period of time before they are implanted The
term PGD usually refers to both the diagnosis selection and the implantation of the selected embryos
In the least controversial use of PGD embryos are tested for the presence of alleles which cause genetic
diseases such as sickle cell disease muscular dystrophy and hemophilia in which a single diseasecausing
allele or pair of alleles has been identified By excluding embryos containing these alleles from implantation
into the mother the disease is prevented and the unused embryos are either donated to science or
