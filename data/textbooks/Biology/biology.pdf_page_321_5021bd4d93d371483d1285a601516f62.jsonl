the offspring To clarify this further remember that the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing
organism are originally inherited as two separate sets one from each parent Using humans as an example
one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother The father provides the other set of
23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the egg Every cell of the multicellular offspring has copies of the
original two sets of homologous chromosomes In prophase I of meiosis the homologous chromosomes form
the tetrads In metaphase I these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell to form
the metaphase plate Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or
paternally inherited chromosome the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random Thus any
maternally inherited chromosome may face either pole Likewise any paternally inherited chromosome may also
face either pole The orientation of each tetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22 tetrads
This eventthe random or independent assortment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plateis
the second mechanism that introduces variation into the gametes or spores In each cell that undergoes
meiosis the arrangement of the tetrads is different The number of variations is dependent on the number of
chromosomes making up a set There are two possibilities for orientation at the metaphase plate the possible
number of alignments therefore equals 2n in a diploid cell where n is the number of chromosomes per haploid
set Humans have 23 chromosome pairs which results in over eight million 223 possible geneticallydistinct
gametes just from the random alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate This number does not include
the variability that was previously produced by crossing over between the nonsister chromatids Given these two
mechanisms it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the same genetic
composition Figure 114
To summarize meiosis I creates genetically diverse gametes in two ways First during prophase I crossover
events between the nonsister chromatids of each homologous pair of chromosomes generate recombinant
chromatids with new combinations of maternal and paternal genes Second the random assortment of tetrads
on the metaphase plate produces unique combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes that will make
their way into the gametes
