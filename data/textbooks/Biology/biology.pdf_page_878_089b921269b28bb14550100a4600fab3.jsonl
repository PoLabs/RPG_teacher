The amnion protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration
In mammals the yolk sac is very reduced but the embryo is still cushioned and enclosed within the amnion The
placenta which transports nutrients and functions in gas exchange and waste management is derived from the
chorion and allantois
Figure 2922 An amniotic egg The key features of an amniotic egg are shown
Which of the following statements about the parts of an egg are false
1
The allantois stores nitrogenous waste and facilitates respiration
2
The chorion facilitates gas exchange
3
The yolk provides food for the growing embryo
4
The amniotic cavity is filled with albumen
Additional derived characteristics of amniotes include a waterproof skin accessory keratinized structures and
costal rib ventilation of the lungs
Evolution of Amniotes
The first amniotes evolved from tetrapod ancestors approximately 340 million years ago during the
Carboniferous period The early amniotes quickly diverged into two main lines synapsids and sauropsids
Synapsids included the therapsids a clade from which mammals evolved Sauropsids were further divided into
anapsids and diapsids Diapsids gave rise to the reptiles including the dinosaurs and birds The key differences
between the synapsids anapsids and diapsids are the structures of the skull and the number of temporal
fenestrae windows behind each eye Figure 2923 Temporal fenestrae are postorbital openings in the
skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen Anapsids have no temporal fenestrae synapsids have one
fused ancestrally from two fenestrae and diapsids have two although many diapsids such as birds have highly
modified diapsid skulls Anapsids include extinct organisms and traditionally included turtles However more
recent molecular and fossil evidence clearly shows that turtles arose within the diapsid line and secondarily lost
the temporal fenestrae thus they appear to be anapsids because modern turtles do not have fenestrae in the
temporal bones of the skull The canonical diapsids include dinosaurs birds and all other extinct and living
reptiles
