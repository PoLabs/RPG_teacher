pancreas and saliva Aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex is stimulated by a decrease in blood
concentrations of sodium ions blood volume or blood pressure or by an increase in blood potassium levels
The three main glucocorticoids are cortisol corticosterone and cortisone The glucocorticoids stimulate the
synthesis of glucose and gluconeogenesis converting a noncarbohydrate to glucose by liver cells and they
promote the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue These hormones increase blood glucose levels to
maintain levels within a normal range between meals These hormones are secreted in response to ACTH and
levels are regulated by negative feedback
Androgens are sex hormones that promote masculinity They are produced in small amounts by the adrenal
cortex in both males and females They do not affect sexual characteristics and may supplement sex hormones
released from the gonads
Adrenal Medulla
The adrenal medulla contains large irregularly shaped cells that are closely associated with blood vessels
These cells are innervated by preganglionic autonomic nerve fibers from the central nervous system
The adrenal medulla contains two types of secretory cells one that produces epinephrine adrenaline and
another that produces norepinephrine noradrenaline Epinephrine is the primary adrenal medulla hormone
accounting for 75 to 80 percent of its secretions Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase heart rate breathing
rate cardiac muscle contractions blood pressure and blood glucose levels They also accelerate the
breakdown of glucose in skeletal muscles and stored fats in adipose tissue
The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine is stimulated by neural impulses from the sympathetic nervous
system Secretion of these hormones is stimulated by acetylcholine release from preganglionic sympathetic
fibers innervating the adrenal medulla These neural impulses originate from the hypothalamus in response to
stress to prepare the body for the fightorflight response
Pancreas
The pancreas illustrated in Figure 3719 is an elongated organ that is located between the stomach and
the proximal portion of the small intestine It contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and
endocrine cells that release hormones It is sometimes referred to as a heterocrine gland because it has both
endocrine and exocrine functions
Figure 3719 The pancreas is found underneath the stomach and points toward the spleen credit modification of
work by NCI
The endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans as visible
in the micrograph shown in Figure 3720 The pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types alpha cells
which produce the hormone glucagon and beta cells which produce the hormone insulin These hormones
regulate blood glucose levels As blood glucose levels decline alpha cells release glucagon to raise the blood
glucose levels by increasing rates of glycogen breakdown and glucose release by the liver When blood glucose
levels rise such as after a meal beta cells release insulin to lower blood glucose levels by increasing the rate
