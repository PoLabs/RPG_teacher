EXCRETION
Figure 411 Just as humans recycle what we can and dump the remains into landfills our bodies use and recycle what
they can and excrete the remaining waste products Our bodies complex systems have developed ways to treat waste
and maintain a balanced internal environment credit modification of work by Redwin Law

Introduction
The daily intake recommendation for human water consumption is eight to ten glasses of water In order to
achieve a healthy balance the human body should excrete the eight to ten glasses of water every day This
occurs via the processes of urination defecation sweating and to a small extent respiration The organs
and tissues of the human body are soaked in fluids that are maintained at constant temperature pH and
solute concentration all crucial elements of homeostasis The solutes in body fluids are mainly mineral salts
and sugars and osmotic regulation is the process by which the mineral salts and water are kept in balance
Osmotic homeostasis is maintained despite the influence of external factors like temperature diet and weather
