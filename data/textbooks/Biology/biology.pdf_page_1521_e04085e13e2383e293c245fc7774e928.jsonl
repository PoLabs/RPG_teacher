Finally global warming will raise ocean levels due to meltwater from glaciers and the greater volume of warmer
water Shorelines will be inundated reducing island size which will have an effect on some species and a
number of islands will disappear entirely Additionally the gradual melting and subsequent refreezing of the
poles glaciers and higher elevation mountainsa cycle that has provided freshwater to environments for
centurieswill also be jeopardized This could result in an overabundance of salt water and a shortage of fresh
water
474  Preserving Biodiversity
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify new technologies and methods for describing biodiversity

Explain the legislative framework for conservation

Describe principles and challenges of conservation preserve design

Identify examples of the effects of habitat restoration

Discuss the role of zoos in biodiversity conservation
Preserving biodiversity is an extraordinary challenge that must be met by greater understanding of biodiversity
itself changes in human behavior and beliefs and various preservation strategies
Measuring Biodiversity
The technology of molecular genetics and data processing and storage are maturing to the point where
cataloguing the planets species in an accessible way is now feasible DNA barcoding is one molecular genetic
method which takes advantage of rapid evolution in a mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase 1 present
in eukaryotes except for plants to identify species using the sequence of portions of the gene However
plants may be barcoded using a combination of chloroplast genes Rapid mass sequencing machines make
the molecular genetics portion of the work relatively inexpensive and quick Computer resources store and
make available the large volumes of data Projects are currently underway to use DNA barcoding to catalog
museum specimens which have already been named and studied as well as testing the method on lessstudied
groups As of mid 2017 close to 200000 named species had been barcoded Early studies suggest there are
significant numbers of undescribed species that looked too much like sibling species to previously be recognized
as different These now can be identified with DNA barcoding
Numerous computer databases now provide information about named species and a framework for adding new
species However as already noted at the present rate of description of new species it will take close to 500
years before the complete catalog of life is known Many perhaps most species on the planet do not have that
much time
There is also the problem of understanding which species known to science are threatened and to what degree
they are threatened This task is carried out by the nonprofit IUCN which as previously mentioned maintains
the Red Listan online listing of endangered species categorized by taxonomy type of threat and other criteria
Figure 4716 The Red List is supported by scientific research In 2011 the list contained 61000 species all
with supporting documentation
