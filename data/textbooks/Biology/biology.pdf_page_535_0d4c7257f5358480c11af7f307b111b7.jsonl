Testing the Bottleneck Effect
Question How do natural disasters affect a populations genetic structure
Background When an earthquake or hurricane suddenly wipes out much of a population the surviving
individuals are usually a random sampling of the original group As a result the populations genetic makeup
can change dramatically We call this phenomenon the bottleneck effect
Hypothesis Repeated natural disasters will yield different population genetic structures therefore each
time one runs this experiment the results will vary
Test the hypothesis Count out the original population using different colored beads For example red
blue and yellow beads might represent red blue and yellow individuals After recording the number of
each individual in the original population place them all in a bottle with a narrow neck that will only allow a
few beads out at a time Then pour 13 of the bottles contents into a bowl This represents the surviving
individuals after a natural disaster kills a majority of the population Count the number of the different colored
beads in the bowl and record it Then place all of the beads back in the bottle and repeat the experiment
four more times
Analyze the data Compare the five populations that resulted from the experiment Do the populations all
contain the same number of different colored beads or do they vary Remember these populations all
came from the same exact parent population
Form a conclusion Most likely the five resulting populations will differ quite dramatically This is because
natural disasters are not selectivethey kill and spare individuals at random Now think about how this
might affect a real population What happens when a hurricane hits the Mississippi Gulf Coast How do the
seabirds that live on the beach fare
Gene Flow
Another important evolutionary force is gene flow the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the
migration of individuals or gametes Figure 196 While some populations are fairly stable others experience
more flux Many plants for example send their pollen far and wide by wind or by bird to pollinate other
populations of the same species some distance away Even a population that may initially appear to be stable
such as a pride of lions can experience its fair share of immigration and emigration as developing males leave
their mothers to seek out a new pride with genetically unrelated females This variable flow of individuals in and
out of the group not only changes the populations gene structure but it can also introduce new genetic variation
to populations in different geological locations and habitats
