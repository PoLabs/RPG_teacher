forms Cleavage in most deuterostomes is also indeterminant meaning that the developmental fates of early
embryonic cells are not decided at that point of embryonic development this is why we could potentially clone
most deuterostomes including ourselves
The deuterostomes consist of two major cladesthe Chordata and the Ambulacraria The Chordata include
the vertebrates and two invertebrate subphyla the urochordates and the cephalochordates The Ambulacraria
include the echinoderms and the hemichordates which were once considered to be a chordate subphylum
Figure 2846 The two clades in addition to being deuterostomes have some other interesting features in
common As we have seen the vast majority of invertebrate animals do not possess a defined bony vertebral
endoskeleton or a bony cranium However one of the most ancestral groups of deuterostome invertebrates
the Echinodermata do produce tiny skeletal bones called ossicles that make up a true endoskeleton or
internal skeleton covered by an epidermis The Hemichordata acorn worms and pterobranchs will not be
covered here but share with the echinoderms a threepart tripartite coelom similar larval forms and a derived
metanephridium that rids the animals of nitrogenous wastes They also share pharyngeal slits with the chordates
Figure 2846 In addition hemichordates have a dorsal nerve cord in the midline of the epidermis but lack a
neural tube a true notochord and the endostyle and postanal tail characteristic of chordates

Phylum Echinodermata
Echinodermata are named after their prickly skin from the Greek echinos meaning prickly and dermos
meaning skin This phylum is a collection of about 7000 described living species of exclusively marine
bottomdwelling organisms Sea stars Figure 2847 sea cucumbers sea urchins sand dollars and brittle stars
are all examples of echinoderms
Morphology and Anatomy
Despite the adaptive value of bilaterality for most freeliving cephalized animals adult echinoderms exhibit
pentaradial symmetry with arms typically arrayed in multiples of five around a central axis Echinoderms have
an endoskeleton made of calcareous ossicles small bony plates covered by the epidermis For this reason it
is an endoskeleton like our own not an exoskeleton like that of arthropods The ossicles may be fused together
embedded separately in the connective tissue of the dermis or be reduced to minute spicules of bone as in sea
cucumbers The spines for which the echinoderms are named are connected to some of the plates The spines
may be moved by small muscles but they can also be locked into place for defense In some species the spines
are surrounded by tiny stalked claws called pedicellaria which help keep the animals surface clean of debris
protect papulae used in respiration and sometimes aid in food capture
The endoskeleton is produced by dermal cells which also produce several kinds of pigments imparting vivid
colors to these animals In sea stars fingerlike projections papillae of dermal tissue extend through the
endoskeleton and function as gills Some cells are glandular and may produce toxins Each arm or section of
the animal contains several different structures for example digestive glands gonads and the tube feet that
are unique to the echinoderms In echinoderms like sea stars every arm bears two rows of tube feet on the oral
side running along an external ambulacral groove These tube feet assist in locomotion feeding and chemical
sensations as well as serve to attach some species to the substratum
