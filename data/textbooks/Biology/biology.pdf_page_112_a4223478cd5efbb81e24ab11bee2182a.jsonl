bond formed between two amino acids by a dehydration reaction
linkage covalent chemical bond that holds together the polynucleotide chains with a
phosphate group linking neighboring nucleotides two pentose sugars
membranes major constituent comprised of two fatty acids and a phosphatecontaining group
attached to a glycerol backbone
chain of monomer residues that covalent bonds link polymerization is the process of polymer
formation from monomers by condensation
long chain of nucleotides
long chain of amino acids that peptide bonds link
long chain of monosaccharides may be branched or unbranched
linear sequence of amino acids in a protein
biological macromolecule comprised of one or more amino acid chains
type of nitrogenous base in DNA and RNA adenine and guanine are purines
type of nitrogenous base in DNA and RNA cytosine thymine and uracil are pyrimidines
association of discrete polypeptide subunits in a protein
singlestranded often internally base paired molecule that is involved in protein
synthesis
RNA that ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes during protein
synthesis and catalyzes forming the peptide linkage
longchain hydrocarbon with single covalent bonds in the carbon chain the number of
hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized
regular structure that proteins form by intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the
oxygen atom of one amino acid residue and the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom of another amino
acid residue
storage carbohydrate in plants
type of lipid comprised of four fused hydrocarbon rings forming a planar structure
a proteins threedimensional conformation including interactions between secondary
structural elements formed from interactions between amino acid side chains
fat formed artificially by hydrogenating oils leading to a different arrangement of double bonds than
those in naturally occurring lipids
process through which messenger RNA forms on a template of DNA
RNA that carries activated amino acids to the site of protein synthesis on the ribosome
process through which RNA directs the proteins formation
fat molecule consists of three fatty acids linked to a glycerol molecule
longchain hydrocarbon that has one or more double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain
lipid comprised of a longchain fatty acid that is esterified to a longchain alcohol serves as a protective
coating on some feathers aquatic mammal fur and leaves
