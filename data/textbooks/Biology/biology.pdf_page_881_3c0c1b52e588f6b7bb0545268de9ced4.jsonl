Figure 2925 Pterosaurs Pterosaurs such as this Quetzalcoatlus which existed from the late Triassic to the
Cretaceous period 230 to 655 million years ago possessed wings but are not believed to have been capable of
powered flight Instead they may have been able to soar after launching from cliffs credit Mark Witton Darren Naish
Archosaurs Dinosaurs
Dinosaurs fearfullygreat lizard include the Saurischia lizardhipped with a simple threepronged pelvis
and Ornithischia birdhipped dinosaurs with a more complex pelvis superficially similar to that of birds
However it is a fact that birds evolved from the saurischian lizard hipped lineage not the ornithischian bird
hip lineage Dinosaurs and their theropod descendants the birds are remnants of what was formerly a hugely
diverse group of reptiles some of which like Argentinosaurus were nearly 40 meters 130 feet in length and
weighed at least 80000 kg 88 tons They were the largest land animals to have lived challenging and perhaps
exceeding the great blue whale in size but probably not weightwhich could be greater than 200 tons
Herrerasaurus a bipedal dinosaur from Argentina was one of the earliest dinosaurs that walked upright with the
legs positioned directly below the pelvis rather than splayed outward to the sides as in the crocodilians The
Ornithischia were all herbivores and sometimes evolved into crazy shapes such as ankylosaur armored tanks
and horned dinosaurs such as Triceratops Some such as Parasaurolophus lived in great herds and may have
amplified their speciesspecific calls through elaborate crests on their heads
Both the ornithischian and saurischian dinosaurs provided parental care for their broods just as crocodilians
and birds do today The end of the age of dinosaurs came about 65 million years ago during the Mesozoic
coinciding with the impact of a large asteroid that produced the Chicxulub crater in what is now the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico Besides the immediate environmental disasters associated with this asteroid impacting the
Earth at about 45000 miles per hour the impact may also have helped generate an enormous series of volcanic
eruptions that changed the distribution and abundance of plant life worldwide as well as its climate At the end
of the Triassic massive volcanic activity across North America South America Africa and southwest Europe
ultimately would lead to the breakup of Pangea and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean The formerly incredibly
diverse dinosaurs save for the evolving birds met their extinction during this time period
Archosaurs Pterosaurs
More than 200 species of pterosaurs have been described and in their day beginning about 230 million years
ago they were the undisputed rulers of the Mesozoic skies for over 170 million years Recent fossils suggest
that hundreds of pterosaur species may have lived during any given period dividing up the environment much
like birds do today Pterosaurs came in amazing sizes and shapes ranging in size from that of a small song bird
to that of the enormous Quetzalcoatlus northropi which stood nearly 6 meters 19 feet high and had a wingspan
of nearly 14 meters 40 feet This monstrous pterosaur named after the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl the feathered
flying serpent that contributed largely to the creation of humankind may have been the largest flying animal that
ever evolved
Some male pterosaurs apparently had brightly colored crests that may have served in sexual displays some of
these crests were much higher than the actual head Pterosaurs had ultralight skeletons with a pteroid bone
unique to pterosaurs that strengthened the forewing membrane Much of their wing span was exaggerated
by a greatly elongated fourth finger that supported perhaps half of the wing It is tempting to relate to them in
terms of bird characteristics but in reality their proportions were decidedly not like birds at all For example it is
