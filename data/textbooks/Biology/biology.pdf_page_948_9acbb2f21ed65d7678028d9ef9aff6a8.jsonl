In their 1880 treatise The Power of Movements in Plants Charles Darwin and his son Francis first described
phototropism as the bending of seedlings toward light Darwin observed that light was perceived by the tip of
the plant the apical meristem but that the response bending took place in a different part of the plant They
concluded that the signal had to travel from the apical meristem to the base of the plant

In 1913 Peter BoysenJensen demonstrated that a chemical signal produced in the plant tip was responsible
for the bending at the base He cut off the tip of a seedling covered the cut section with a layer of gelatin and
then replaced the tip The seedling bent toward the light when illuminated However when impermeable mica
flakes were inserted between the tip and the cut base the seedling did not bend A refinement of the experiment
showed that the signal traveled on the shaded side of the seedling When the mica plate was inserted on the
illuminated side the plant did bend towards the light Therefore the chemical signal was a growth stimulant
because the phototropic response involved faster cell elongation on the shaded side than on the illuminated
side We now know that as light passes through a plant stem it is diffracted and generates phototropin activation
across the stem Most activation occurs on the lit side causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid IAA to
accumulate on the shaded side Stem cells elongate under influence of IAA
Cryptochromes are another class of bluelight absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavinbased
chromophore Cryptochromes set the plants 24hour activity cycle also know as its circadian rhythem using
blue light cues There is some evidence that cryptochromes work together with phototropins to mediate the
phototropic response

Plant Responses to Gravity
Whether or not they germinate in the light or in total darkness shoots usually sprout up from the ground and
roots grow downward into the ground A plant laid on its side in the dark will send shoots upward when given
enough time Gravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight Growth
of the shoot apical tip upward is called negative gravitropism whereas growth of the roots downward is called
positive gravitropism
Amyloplasts also known as statoliths are specialized plastids that contain starch granules and settle
downward in response to gravity Amyloplasts are found in shoots and in specialized cells of the root cap When
