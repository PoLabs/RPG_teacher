In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere
This causes a condition called splitbrain which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres
For example when an object is presented to patients left visual field they may be unable to verbally name the
object and may claim to not have seen an object at all This is because the visual input from the left visual field
crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then signal to the speech center which generally is found
in the left side of the brain Remarkably if a splitbrain patient is asked to pick up a specific object out of a group
of objects with the left hand the patient will be able to do so but will still be unable to vocally identify it

play a game where you can model the splitbrain experiments yourself
Each cortical hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in different functions Scientists use
various techniques to determine what brain areas are involved in different functions they examine patients
who have had injuries or diseases that affect specific areas and see how those areas are related to functional
deficits They also conduct animal studies where they stimulate brain areas and see if there are any behavioral
changes They use a technique called transmagnetic stimulation TMS to temporarily deactivate specific parts
of the cortex using strong magnets placed outside the head and they use functional magnetic resonance
imaging fMRI to look at changes in oxygenated blood flow in particular brain regions that correlate with specific
behavioral tasks These techniques and others have given great insight into the functions of different brain
regions but have also showed that any given brain area can be involved in more than one behavior or process
and any given behavior or process generally involves neurons in multiple brain areas That being said each
hemisphere of the mammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially defined
lobes frontal parietal temporal and occipital Figure 3521 illustrates these four lobes of the human cerebral
cortex
