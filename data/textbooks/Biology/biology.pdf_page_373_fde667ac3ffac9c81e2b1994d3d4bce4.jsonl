Despite compelling correlations between chromosome behavior during meiosis and Mendels abstract laws
scientists proposed the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance long before there was any direct evidence that
chromosomes carried traits Critics pointed out that individuals had far more independently segregating traits
than they had chromosomes It was only after several years of carrying out crosses with the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster that Thomas Hunt Morgan provided experimental evidence to support the Chromosomal Theory
of Inheritance
Genetic Linkage and Distances
Mendels work suggested that traits are inherited independently of each other Morgan identified a 11
correspondence between a segregating trait and the X chromosome suggesting that random chromosome
segregation was the physical basis of Mendels model This also demonstrated that linked genes disrupt
Mendels predicted outcomes That each chromosome can carry many linked genes explains how individuals
can have many more traits than they have chromosomes However researchers in Morgans laboratory
suggested that alleles positioned on the same chromosome were not always inherited together During meiosis
linked genes somehow became unlinked
Homologous Recombination
In 1909 Frans Janssen observed chiasmatathe point at which chromatids are in contact with each other and
may exchange segmentsprior to the first meiosis division He suggested that alleles become unlinked and
chromosomes physically exchange segments As chromosomes condensed and paired with their homologs
they appeared to interact at distinct points Janssen suggested that these points corresponded to regions in
which chromosome segments exchanged We now know that the pairing and interaction between homologous
chromosomes or synapsis does more than simply organize the homologs for migration to separate daughter
cells When synapsed homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in
homologous recombination or more simply crossing over
To better understand the type of experimental results that researchers were obtaining at this time consider a
heterozygous individual that inherited dominant maternal alleles for two genes on the same chromosome such
as AB and two recessive paternal alleles for those same genes such as ab If the genes are linked one would
expect this individual to produce gametes that are either AB or ab with a 11 ratio If the genes are unlinked
the individual should produce AB Ab aB and ab gametes with equal frequencies according to the Mendelian
concept of independent assortment Because they correspond to new allele combinations the genotypes Ab
and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis Parental types are
progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents Morgan and his colleagues however found
that when they test crossed such heterozygous individuals to a homozygous recessive parent AaBb  aabb
both parental and nonparental cases occurred For example 950 offspring might be recovered that were either
AaBb or aabb but 50 offspring would also result that were either Aabb or aaBb These results suggested that
linkage occurred most often but a significant minority of offspring were the products of recombination
