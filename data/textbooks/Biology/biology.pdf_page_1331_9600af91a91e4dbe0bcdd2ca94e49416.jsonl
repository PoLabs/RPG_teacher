Figure 4220 a Lymphatic vessels carry a clear fluid called lymph throughout the body The liquid enters b lymph
nodes through afferent vessels Lymph nodes are filled with lymphocytes that purge infecting cells The lymph then
exits through efferent vessels credit modification of work by NIH NCI
The spleen houses B and T cells macrophages dendritic cells and NK cells The spleen shown in Figure
4221 is the site where APCs that have trapped foreign particles in the blood can communicate with
lymphocytes Antibodies are synthesized and secreted by activated plasma cells in the spleen and the spleen
filters foreign substances and antibodycomplexed pathogens from the blood Functionally the spleen is to the
blood as lymph nodes are to the lymph
Figure 4221 The spleen is similar to a lymph node but is much larger and filters blood instead of lymph Blood enters
the spleen through arteries and exits through veins The spleen contains two types of tissue red pulp and white
pulp Red pulp consists of cavities that store blood Within the red pulp damaged red blood cells are removed and
replaced by new ones White pulp is rich in lymphocytes that remove antigencoated bacteria from the blood credit
