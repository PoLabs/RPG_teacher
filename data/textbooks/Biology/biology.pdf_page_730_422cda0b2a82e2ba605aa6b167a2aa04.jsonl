Figure 2519 The jointed stem of a horsetail Thin leaves originating at the joints are noticeable on the horsetail plant
Because silica deposited in the cell walls made these plants abrasive horsetails were once used as scrubbing brushes
and were nicknamed scouring rushes credit Myriam Feldman
Silica collected by in the epidermal cells contributes to the stiffness of horsetail plants but underground stems
known as rhizomes anchor the plants to the ground Modernday horsetails are homosporous The spores are
attached to elatersas we have seen these are coiled threads that spring open in dry weather and casts
the spores to a location distant from the parent plants The spores then germinate to produce small bisexual
gametophytes
Phylum Monilophyta Class Psilotopsida Whisk Ferns
While most ferns form large leaves and branching roots the whisk ferns class Psilotopsida lack both roots and
leaves probably lost by reduction Photosynthesis takes place in their green stems which branch dichotomously
Small yellow knobs form at the tip of a branch or at branch nodes and contain the sporangia Figure 2520
Spores develop into gametophytes that are only a few millimeters across but which produce both male and
female gametangia Whisk ferns were considered early pterophytes However recent comparative DNA analysis
suggests that this group may have lost both vascular tissue and roots through evolution and is more closely
related to ferns
