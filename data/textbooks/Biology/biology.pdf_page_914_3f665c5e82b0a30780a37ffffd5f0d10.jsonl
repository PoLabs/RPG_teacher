301  The Plant Body
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the shoot organ system and the root organ system

Distinguish between meristematic tissue and permanent tissue

Identify and describe the three regions where plant growth occurs

Summarize the roles of dermal tissue vascular tissue and ground tissue

Compare simple plant tissue with complex plant tissue
Like animals plants contain cells with organelles in which specific metabolic activities take place Unlike animals
however plants use energy from sunlight to form sugars during photosynthesis In addition plant cells have cell
walls plastids and a large central vacuole structures that are not found in animal cells Each of these cellular
structures plays a specific role in plant structure and function

Plant Organ Systems
In plants just as in animals similar cells working together form a tissue When different types of tissues
work together to perform a unique function they form an organ organs working together form organ systems
Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems a shoot system and a root system The shoot system consists
of two portions the vegetative nonreproductive parts of the plant such as the leaves and the stems and
the reproductive parts of the plant which include flowers and fruits The shoot system generally grows above
ground where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis The root system which supports the plants and
absorbs water and minerals is usually underground Figure 302 shows the organ systems of a typical plant
