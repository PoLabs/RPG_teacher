Transfer of Energy and the Resulting Entropy
Set up a simple experiment to understand how energy transfers and how a change in entropy results
1
Take a block of ice This is water in solid form so it has a high structural order This means that the
molecules cannot move very much and are in a fixed position The ices temperature is 0C As a result
the systems entropy is low
2
Allow the ice to melt at room temperature What is the state of molecules in the liquid water now How
did the energy transfer take place Is the systems entropy higher or lower Why
3
Heat the water to its boiling point What happens to the systems entropy when the water is heated
Think of all physical systems of in this way Living things are highly ordered requiring constant energy input to
maintain themselves in a state of low entropy As living systems take in energystoring molecules and transform
them through chemical reactions they lose some amount of usable energy in the process because no reaction
is completely efficient They also produce waste and byproducts that are not useful energy sources This
process increases the entropy of the systems surroundings Since all energy transfers result in losing some
usable energy the second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer or transformation increases
the universes entropy Even though living things are highly ordered and maintain a state of low entropy the
universes entropy in total is constantly increasing due to losing usable energy with each energy transfer that
occurs Essentially living things are in a continuous uphill battle against this constant increase in universal
entropy
Figure 612 Entropy is a measure of randomness or disorder in a system Gases have higher entropy than liquids and
liquids have higher entropy than solids

By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain ATPs role as the cellular energy currency

Describe how energy releases through ATP hydrolysis
Even exergonic energyreleasing reactions require a small amount of activation energy in order to proceed
However consider endergonic reactions which require much more energy input because their products have
