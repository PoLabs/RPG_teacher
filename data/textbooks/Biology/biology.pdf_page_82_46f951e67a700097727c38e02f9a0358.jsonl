Figure 34 Scientists classify monosaccharides based on the position of their carbonyl group and the number of
carbons in the backbone Aldoses have a carbonyl group indicated in green at the end of the carbon chain and
ketoses have a carbonyl group in the middle of the carbon chain Trioses pentoses and hexoses have three five
and six carbon backbones respectively
The chemical formula for glucose is C6H12O6 In humans glucose is an important source of energy During
cellular respiration energy releases from glucose and that energy helps make adenosine triphosphate ATP
Plants synthesize glucose using carbon dioxide and water and glucose in turn provides energy requirements
for the plant Humans and other animals that feed on plants often store excess glucose as catabolized cell
breakdown of larger molecules starch
Galactose part of lactose or milk sugar and fructose found in sucrose in fruit are other common
monosaccharides Although glucose galactose and fructose all have the same chemical formula C6H12O6
they differ structurally and chemically and are isomers because of the different arrangement of functional
groups around the asymmetric carbon All these monosaccharides have more than one asymmetric carbon
