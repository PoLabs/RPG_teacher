selecting crop varieties This crop diversity matched the cultural diversity of highly subdivided populations of
humans For example potatoes were domesticated beginning around 7000 years ago in the central Andes of
Peru and Bolivia The potatoes grown in that region belong to seven species and the number of varieties likely is
in the thousands Even the Inca capital of Machu Picchu had numerous gardens growing varieties of potatoes
Each variety has been bred to thrive at particular elevations and soil and climate conditions The diversity is
driven by the diverse demands of the topography the limited movement of people and the demands created by
crop rotation for different varieties that will do well in different fields
Potatoes are only one example of humangenerated diversity Every plant animal and fungus that has been
cultivated by humans has been bred from original wild ancestor species into diverse varieties arising from the
demands for food value adaptation to growing conditions and resistance to pests
The potato also demonstrates risks of low crop diversity The tragic Irish potato famine occurred when the single
variety grown in Ireland became susceptible to a potato blight wiping out the entire crop The loss of the potato
crop led to mass famine and the related deaths of over one million people as well as mass emigration of nearly
two million people
Disease resistance is a chief benefit of crop biodiversity and lack of diversity in contemporary crop species
carries similar risks Seed companies which are the source of most crop varieties in developed countries must
continually breed new varieties to keep up with evolving pest organisms These same seed companies however
have participated in the decline of the number of varieties available as they focus on selling fewer varieties in
more areas of the world
The ability to create new crop varieties relies on the diversity of varieties available and the accessibility of wild
forms related to the crop plant These wild forms are often the source of new gene variants that can be bred
with existing varieties to create varieties with new attributes Loss of wild species related to a crop will mean the
loss of potential in crop improvement Maintaining the genetic diversity of wild species related to domesticated
species ensures our continued food supply
Since the 1920s government agriculture departments have maintained seed banks of crop varieties as a way
of maintaining crop diversity This system has flaws because over time seed banks are lost through accidents
and there is no way to replace them In 2008 the Svalbard Global Seed Vault Figure 479 began storing
seeds from around the world as a backup system to the regional seed banks If a regional seed bank stores
varieties in Svalbard losses can be replaced from Svalbard Conditions within the vault are maintained at ideal
temperature and humidity for seed survival but the deep underground location of the vault in the arctic means
that failure of the vaults systems will not compromise the climatic conditions inside the vault

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is located on Spitsbergen island in Norway which has an arctic climate
Why might an arctic climate be good for seed storage
