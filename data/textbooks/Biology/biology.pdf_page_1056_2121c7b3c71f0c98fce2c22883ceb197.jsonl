Given the diversity of animal life on our planet it is not surprising that the animal diet would also vary
substantially The animal diet is the source of materials needed for building DNA and other complex molecules
needed for growth maintenance and reproduction collectively these processes are called biosynthesis The
diet is also the source of materials for ATP production in the cells The diet must be balanced to provide the
minerals and vitamins that are required for cellular function
