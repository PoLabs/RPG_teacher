acceleration approaching 40000 times that of gravity The microscopic threads then either entangle the prey
or instantly penetrate the flesh of the prey or predator releasing toxins including neurotoxins and poreforming
toxins that can lead to cell lysis into the target thereby immobilizing it or paralyzing it see Figure 285
Figure 285 Cnidocytes Animals from the phylum Cnidaria have stinging cells called cnidocytes Cnidocytes contain
large organelles called a nematocysts that store a coiled thread and barb the nematocyst When the hairlike cnidocil
on the cell surface is touched even lightly b the thread barb and a toxin are fired from the organelle

Two distinct body plans are found in Cnidarians the polyp or tuliplike stalk form and the medusa or bell
form Figure 286 An example of the polyp form is found in the genus Hydra whereas the most typical form
of medusa is found in the group called the sea jellies jellyfish Polyp forms are sessile as adults with a
single opening the mouthanus to the digestive cavity facing up with tentacles surrounding it Medusa forms
are motile with the mouth and tentacles hanging down from an umbrellashaped bell
Figure 286 Cnidarian body forms Cnidarians have two distinct body plans the medusa a and the polyp b All
cnidarians have two membrane layers with a jellylike mesoglea between them
Some cnidarians are dimorphic that is they exhibit both body plans during their life cycle In these species
