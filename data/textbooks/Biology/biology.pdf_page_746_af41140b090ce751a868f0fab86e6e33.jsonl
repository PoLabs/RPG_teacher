are classified as either monocots or eudicots based on the structure of their leaves and embryos Basal
angiosperms such as water lilies are considered more ancestral in nature because they share morphological
traits with both monocots and eudicots

Flowers and Fruits as an Evolutionary Adaptation
Angiosperms produce their gametes in separate organs which are usually housed in a flower Both fertilization
and embryo development take place inside an anatomical structure that provides a stable system of sexual
reproduction largely sheltered from environmental fluctuations With about 300000 species flowering plants are
the most diverse phylum on Earth after insects which number about 1200000 species Flowers come in a
bewildering array of sizes shapes colors smells and arrangements Most flowers have a mutualistic pollinator
with the distinctive features of flowers reflecting the nature of the pollination agent The relationship between
pollinator and flower characteristics is one of the great examples of coevolution
Following fertilization of the egg the ovule grows into a seed The surrounding tissues of the ovary thicken
developing into a fruit that will protect the seed and often ensure its dispersal over a wide geographic range Not
all fruits develop completely from an ovary such false fruits or pseudocarps develop from tissues adjacent
to the ovary Like flowers fruit can vary tremendously in appearance size smell and taste Tomatoes green
peppers corn and avocados are all examples of fruits Along with pollen and seeds fruits also act as agents
of dispersal Some may be carried away by the wind Many attract animals that will eat the fruit and pass the
seeds through their digestive systems then deposit the seeds in another location Cockleburs are covered with
stiff hooked spines that can hook into fur or clothing and hitch a ride on an animal for long distances The
cockleburs that clung to the velvet trousers of an enterprising Swiss hiker George de Mestral inspired his
invention of the loop and hook fastener he named Velcro
