Figure 326 Shown is a a cross section of an anther at two developmental stages The immature anther top contains
four microsporangia or pollen sacs Each microsporangium contains hundreds of microspore mother cells that will
each give rise to four pollen grains The tapetum supports the development and maturation of the pollen grains Upon
maturation of the pollen bottom the pollen sac walls split open and the pollen grains male gametophytes are
released as shown in the b micrograph of an immature lily anther In these scanning electron micrographs pollen
sacs are ready to burst releasing their grains credit a modification of work by LibreTexts b modification of work by

Within the microsporangium the microspore mother cell divides by meiosis to give rise to four microspores each
of which will ultimately form a pollen grain Figure 327 An inner layer of cells known as the tapetum provides
nutrition to the developing microspores and contributes key components to the pollen wall Mature pollen grains
contain two cells a generative cell and a pollen tube cell The generative cell is contained within the larger pollen
tube cell Upon germination the tube cell forms the pollen tube through which the generative cell migrates to
enter the ovary During its transit inside the pollen tube the generative cell divides to form two male gametes
sperm cells Upon maturity the microsporangia burst releasing the pollen grains from the anther
