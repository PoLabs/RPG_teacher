Budding
Budding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell or body region
leading to a separation from the original organism into two individuals Budding occurs commonly in some
invertebrate animals such as corals and hydras In hydras a bud forms that develops into an adult and breaks
away from the main body as illustrated in Figure 433 whereas in coral budding the bud does not detach and
multiplies as part of a new colony

Fragmentation
Fragmentation is the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration If the animal is capable
of fragmentation and the part is big enough a separate individual will regrow
For example in many sea stars asexual reproduction is accomplished by fragmentation Figure 434 illustrates
a sea star for which an arm of the individual is broken off and regenerates a new sea star Fisheries workers
have been known to try to kill the sea stars eating their clam or oyster beds by cutting them in half and throwing
them back into the ocean Unfortunately for the workers the two parts can each regenerate a new half resulting
in twice as many sea stars to prey upon the oysters and clams Fragmentation also occurs in annelid worms
turbellarians and poriferans
