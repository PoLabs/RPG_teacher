6  METABOLISM
Figure 61 A hummingbird needs energy to maintain prolonged periods of flight The bird obtains its energy from taking
in food and transforming the nutrients into energy through a series of biochemical reactions The flight muscles in birds
are extremely efficient in energy production credit modification of work by Cory Zanker

Introduction
Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires energy Organisms require energy to perform heavy
labor and exercise but humans also use considerable energy while thinking and even during sleep Every
organisms living cells constantly use energy Organisms import nutrients and other molecules They metabolize
break down and possibly synthesize into new molecules If necessary molecules modify move around the cell
and may distribute themselves to the entire organism For example the large proteins that make up muscles are
actively built from smaller molecules Complex carbohydrates break down into simple sugars that the cell uses
for energy Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building energy is required to synthesize
and break down molecules Additionally signaling molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters transport
between cells Cells ingest and break down bacteria and viruses Cells must also export waste and toxins to stay
healthy and many cells must swim or move surrounding materials via the beating motion of cellular appendages
like cilia and flagella
The cellular processes that we listed above require a steady supply of energy From where and in what form
does this energy come How do living cells obtain energy and how do they use it This chapter will discuss
different forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer This chapter will also describe how
cells use energy and replenish it and how chemical reactions in the cell perform with great efficiency
