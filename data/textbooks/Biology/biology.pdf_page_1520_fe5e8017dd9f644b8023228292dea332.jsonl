habitat loss and the expansion of disease organisms Scientists disagree about the likely magnitude of the
effects with extinction rate estimates ranging from 15 percent to 40 percent of species destined for extinction
by 2050 Scientists do agree however that climate change will alter regional climates including rainfall and
snowfall patterns making habitats less hospitable to the species living in them in particular the endemic
species The warming trend will shift colder climates toward the north and south poles forcing species to move
with their adapted climate norms while facing habitat gaps along the way The shifting ranges will impose new
competitive regimes on species as they find themselves in contact with other species not present in their historic
range One such unexpected species contact is between polar bears and grizzly bears Previously these two
distinct species had separate ranges Now their ranges are overlapping and there are documented cases of
these two species mating and producing viable offspring which may or may not be viable crossing back to
either parental species Changing climates also throw off species delicate timed adaptations to seasonal food
resources and breeding times Many contemporary mismatches to shifts in resource availability and timing have
already been documented
Figure 4715 Since 2008 grizzly bears Ursus arctos horribilis have been spotted farther north than their historic
range a possible consequence of climate change As a result grizzly bear habitat now overlaps polar bear
Ursus maritimus habitat The two species of bears which are capable of mating and producing viable offspring are
considered separate ecological species because historically they lived in different habitats and never met However
in 2006 a hunter shot a wild grizzlypolar bear hybrid known as a grolar bear the first wild hybrid ever found
Range shifts are already being observed for example some European bird species ranges have moved 91 km
northward The same study suggested that the optimal shift based on warming trends was double that distance
suggesting that the populations are not moving quickly enough Range shifts have also been observed in plants
butterflies other insects freshwater fishes reptiles and mammals
Climate gradients will also move up mountains eventually crowding species higher in altitude and eliminating
the habitat for those species adapted to the highest elevations Some climates will completely disappear The
accelerating rate of warming in the arctic significantly reduces snowfall and the formation of sea ice Without the
ice species like polar bears cannot successfully hunt seals which are their only reliable source of food Sea ice
coverage has been decreasing since observations began in the midtwentieth century and the rate of decline
observed in recent years is far greater than previously predicted
