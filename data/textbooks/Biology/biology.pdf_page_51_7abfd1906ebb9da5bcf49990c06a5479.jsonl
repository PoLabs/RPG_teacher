a number and the symbol n For example 1n represents the first energy level located closest to the nucleus
Figure 26 In 1913 Niels Bohrs developed the Bohr model in which electrons exist within principal shells An electron
normally exists in the lowest energy shell available which is the one closest to the nucleus Energy from a photon of
light can bump it up to a higher energy shell but this situation is unstable and the electron quickly decays back to the
ground state In the process it releases a photon of light
Electrons fill orbitals in a consistent order they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus then they continue to
fill orbitals of increasing energy further from the nucleus If there are multiple orbitals of equal energy they fill
with one electron in each energy level before adding a second electron The electrons of the outermost energy
level determine the atoms energetic stability and its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form
molecules
Under standard conditions atoms fill the inner shells first often resulting in a variable number of electrons in
the outermost shell The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can
each have a maximum of eight electrons This is known as the octet rule which states with the exception of
the innermost shell that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their valence
shell the outermost electron shell Figure 27 shows examples of some neutral atoms and their electron
configurations Notice that in Figure 27 helium has a complete outer electron shell with two electrons filling
its first and only shell Similarly neon has a complete outer 2n shell containing eight electrons In contrast
chlorine and sodium have seven and one in their outer shells respectively but theoretically they would be more
energetically stable if they followed the octet rule and had eight
