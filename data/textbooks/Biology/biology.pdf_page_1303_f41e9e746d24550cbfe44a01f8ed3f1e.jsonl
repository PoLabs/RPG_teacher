Gout
Mammals use uric acid crystals as an antioxidant in their cells However too much uric acid tends to form
kidney stones and may also cause a painful condition called gout where uric acid crystals accumulate in the
joints as illustrated in Figure 4114 Food choices that reduce the amount of nitrogenous bases in the diet
help reduce the risk of gout For example tea coffee and chocolate have purinelike compounds called
xanthines and should be avoided by people with gout and kidney stones

415  Hormonal Control of Osmoregulatory Functions
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how hormonal cues help the kidneys synchronize the osmotic needs of the body

Describe how hormones like epinephrine norepinephrine reninangiotensin aldosterone antidiuretic
hormone and atrial natriuretic peptide help regulate waste elimination maintain correct osmolarity and
perform other osmoregulatory functions
While the kidneys operate to maintain osmotic balance and blood pressure in the body they also act in concert
with hormones Hormones are small molecules that act as messengers within the body Hormones are typically
secreted from one cell and travel in the bloodstream to affect a target cell in another portion of the body Different
regions of the nephron bear specialized cells that have receptors to respond to chemical messengers and
hormones Table 411 summarizes the hormones that control the osmoregulatory functions
Hormones That Affect Osmoregulation
Hormone
Where produced
Function
Epinephrine and
Norepinephrine
Adrenal medulla
Can decrease kidney function temporarily by vasoconstriction
Renin
Kidney nephrons
Increases blood pressure by acting on angiotensinogen
