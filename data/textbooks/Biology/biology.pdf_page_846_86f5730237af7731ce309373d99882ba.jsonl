Figure 2845 Insect anatomy In this basic anatomy of a hexapod insect note that insects have a welldeveloped
digestive system yellow a respiratory system blue a circulatory system red and a nervous system purple
Note the multiple hearts and the segmental ganglia
Which of the following statements about insects is false
a
Insects have both dorsal and ventral blood vessels
b
Insects have spiracles openings that allow air to enter into the tracheal system
c
The trachea is part of the digestive system
d
Most insects have a welldeveloped digestive system with a mouth crop and intestine
287  Superphylum Deuterostomia
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the distinguishing characteristics of echinoderms

Describe the distinguishing characteristics of chordates
The phyla Echinodermata and Chordata the phylum that includes humans both belong to the superphylum
Deuterostomia Recall that protostomes and deuterostomes differ in certain aspects of their embryonic
development and they are named based on which opening of the archenteron primitive gut tube develops
first The word deuterostome comes from the Greek word meaning mouth second indicating that the mouth
develops as a secondary structure opposite the location of the blastopore which becomes the anus In
protostomes mouth first the first embryonic opening becomes the mouth and the second opening becomes
the anus
There are a series of other developmental characteristics that differ between protostomes and deuterostomes
including the type of early cleavage embryonic cell division and the mode of formation of the coelom of the
embryo Protosomes typically exhibit spiral mosaic cleavage whereas deuterostomes exhibit radial regulative
cleavage In deuterostomes the endodermal lining of the archenteron usually forms buds called coelomic
pouches that expand and ultimately obliterate the embryonic blastocoel the cavity within the blastula and early
gastrula to become the embryonic mesoderm the third germ layer This happens when the mesodermal
pouches become separated from the invaginating endodermal layer forming the archenteron then expand and
fuse to form the coelomic cavity The resulting coelom is termed an enterocoelom The archenteron develops
into the alimentary canal and a mouth opening is formed by invagination of ectoderm at the pole opposite the
blastopore of the gastrula The blastopore forms the anus of the alimentary system in the juvenile and adult
