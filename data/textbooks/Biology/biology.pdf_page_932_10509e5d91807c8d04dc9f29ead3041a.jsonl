Figure 3026 In the a leaf drawing the central mesophyll is sandwiched between an upper and lower epidermis The
mesophyll has two layers an upper palisade layer comprised of tightly packed columnar cells and a lower spongy
layer comprised of loosely packed irregularly shaped cells Stomata on the leaf underside allow gas exchange A
waxy cuticle covers all aerial surfaces of land plants to minimize water loss These leaf layers are clearly visible in
the b scanning electron micrograph The numerous small bumps in the palisade parenchyma cells are chloroplasts
Chloroplasts are also present in the spongy parenchyma but are not as obvious The bumps protruding from the lower
surface of the leave are glandular trichomes which differ in structure from the stalked trichomes in Figure 3025 credit
b modification of work by Robert R Wise
Like the stem the leaf contains vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem Figure 3027 The xylem
consists of tracheids and vessels which transport water and minerals to the leaves The phloem transports the
photosynthetic products from the leaf to the other parts of the plant A single vascular bundle no matter how
large or small always contains both xylem and phloem tissues
