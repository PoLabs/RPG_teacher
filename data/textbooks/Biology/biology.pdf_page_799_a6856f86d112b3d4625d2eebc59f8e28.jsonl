Introduction
A brief look at any magazine pertaining to our natural world such as National Geographic would show a rich
variety of vertebrates especially mammals and birds To most people these are the animals that attract our
attention Concentrating on vertebrates however gives us a rather biased and limited view of animal diversity
because it ignores nearly 97 percent of the animal kingdomthe invertebratesanimals that lack a cranium and
a defined vertebral column or spine
The invertebrate animal phyla exhibit an enormous variety of cells and tissues adapted for specific purposes and
frequently these tissues are unique to their phyla These specializations show the range of cellular differentiation
possible within the clade Opisthokonta which has both unicellular and multicellular members Cellular and
structural specializations include cuticles for protection spines and tiny harpoons for defense toothy structures
for feeding and wings for flight An exoskeleton may be adapted for movement or for the attachment of muscles
as in the clams and insects Secretory cells can produce venom mucus or digestive enzymes The body plans
of some phyla such as those of the molluscs annelids arthropods and echinoderms have been modified and
adapted throughout evolution to produce thousands of different forms Perhaps you will find it amazing that an
enormous number of both aquatic and terrestrial invertebratesperhaps millions of specieshave not yet been
scientifically classified As a result the phylogenetic relationships among the invertebrates are constantly being
