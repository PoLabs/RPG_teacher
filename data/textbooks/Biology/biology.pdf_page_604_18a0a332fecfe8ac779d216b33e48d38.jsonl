growth media Microbiologists typically grow prokaryotes in the laboratory using an appropriate culture medium
containing all the nutrients needed by the target organism The medium can be liquid broth or solid After an
incubation time at the right temperature there should be evidence of microbial growth Figure 227 Kochs
assistant Julius Petri invented the Petri dish whose use persists in todays laboratories Koch worked primarily
with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium that causes tuberculosis and developed guidelines called
Kochs postulates to identify the organisms responsible for specific diseases Kochs postulates continue to
be widely used in the medical community Kochs postulates include that an organism can be identified as the
cause of disease when it is present in all infected samples and absent in all healthy samples and it is able to
reproduce the infection after being cultured multiple times Today cultures remain a primary diagnostic tool in
medicine and other areas of molecular biology
Figure 227 Bacteria growing on blood agar plates In these agar plates the growth medium is supplemented with
red blood cells Blood agar becomes transparent in the presence of hemolytic Streptococcus which destroys red
blood cells and is used to diagnose Streptococcus infections The plate on the left is inoculated with nonhemolytic
Staphylococcus large white colonies and the plate on the right is inoculated with hemolytic Streptococcus tiny clear
colonies If you look closely at the right plate you can see that the agar surrounding the bacteria has turned clear

Kochs postulates can be fully applied only to organisms that can be isolated and cultured Some prokaryotes
however cannot grow in a laboratory setting In fact over 99 percent of bacteria and archaea are unculturable
For the most part this is due to a lack of knowledge as to what to feed these organisms and how to grow them
they may have special requirements for growth that remain unknown to scientists such as needing specific
micronutrients pH temperature pressure cofactors or cometabolites Some bacteria cannot be cultured
because they are obligate intracellular parasites and cannot be grown outside a host cell
In other cases culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions even though the same
organism could be cultured previously Those organisms that cannot be cultured but are not dead are in a
viablebutnonculturable VBNC state The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental
stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their survival The criteria for entering into the VBNC state are
not completely understood In a process called resuscitation the prokaryote can go back to normal life when
environmental conditions improve
Is the VBNC state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes In fact most of the prokaryotes living in the soil
or in oceanic waters are nonculturable It has been said that only a small fraction perhaps one percent of
prokaryotes can be cultured under laboratory conditions If these organisms are nonculturable then how is it
known whether they are present and alive Microbiologists use molecular techniques such as the polymerase
chain reaction PCR to amplify selected portions of DNA of prokaryotes eg 16S rRNA genes demonstrating
their existence Recall that PCR can make billions of copies of a DNA segment in a process called
amplification
The Ecology of Biofilms
Some prokaryotes may be unculturable because they require the presence of other prokaryotic species Until a
couple of decades ago microbiologists used to think of prokaryotes as isolated entities living apart This model
however does not reflect the true ecology of prokaryotes most of which prefer to live in communities where
they can interact As we have seen a biofilm is a microbial community Figure 228 held together in a gummy
textured matrix that consists primarily of polysaccharides secreted by the organisms together with some proteins
and nucleic acids Biofilms typically grow attached to surfaces Some of the beststudied biofilms are composed
of prokaryotes although fungal biofilms have also been described as well as some composed of a mixture of
