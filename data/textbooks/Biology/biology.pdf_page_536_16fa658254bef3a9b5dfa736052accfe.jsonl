Mutation
Mutations are changes to an organisms DNA and are an important driver of diversity in populations Species
evolve because of mutations accumulating over time The appearance of new mutations is the most common
way to introduce novel genotypic and phenotypic variance Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are
quickly eliminated from the population by natural selection Others are beneficial and will spread through the
population Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism
survive to sexual maturity and reproduce Some mutations do not do anything and can linger unaffected by
natural selection in the genome Some can have a dramatic effect on a gene and the resulting phenotype
Nonrandom Mating
If individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers the result can be a changing population There are many
reasons nonrandom mating occurs One reason is simple mate choice For example female peahens may
prefer peacocks with bigger brighter tails Natural selection picks traits that lead to more mating selections for an
individual One common form of mate choice called assortative mating is an individuals preference to mate
with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves
Another cause of nonrandom mating is physical location This is especially true in large populations spread over
vast geographic distances where not all individuals will have equal access to one another Some might be miles
apart through woods or over rough terrain while others might live immediately nearby
Environmental Variance
Genes are not the only players involved in determining population variation Other factors such as the
environment Figure 197 also influence phenotypes A beachgoer is likely to have darker skin than a city
dweller for example due to regular exposure to the sun an environmental factor For some species the
environment determines some major characteristics such as gender For example some turtles and other
reptiles have temperaturedependent sex determination TSD TSD means that individuals develop into males
if their eggs are incubated within a certain temperature range or females at a different temperature range
