Waters High Heat Capacity
Waters high heat capacity is a property that hydrogen bonding among water molecules causes Water has the
highest specific heat capacity of any liquids We define specific heat as the amount of heat one gram of a
substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius For water this amount is one
calorie It therefore takes water a long time to heat and a long time to cool In fact waters specific heat capacity
is about five times more than that of sand This explains why the land cools faster than the sea Due to its
high heat capacity warm blooded animals use water to more evenly disperse heat in their bodies it acts in a
similar manner to a cars cooling system transporting heat from warm places to cool places causing the body
to maintain a more even temperature
Waters Heat of Vaporization
Water also has a high heat of vaporization the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid
substance to a gas A considerable amount of heat energy 586 cal is required to accomplish this change in
water This process occurs on the waters surface As liquid water heats up hydrogen bonding makes it difficult
to separate the liquid water molecules from each other which is required for it to enter its gaseous phase
steam As a result water acts as a heat sink or heat reservoir and requires much more heat to boil than
does a liquid such as ethanol grain alcohol whose hydrogen bonding with other ethanol molecules is weaker
than waters hydrogen bonding Eventually as water reaches its boiling point of 100 Celsius 212 Fahrenheit
the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and the kinetic energy motion
between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas Even when below its boiling point
waters individual molecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water
molecules can escape and vaporize we call this process evaporation
The fact that hydrogen bonds need to be broken for water to evaporate means that bonds use a substantial
amount of energy in the process As the water evaporates energy is taken up by the process cooling
the environment where the evaporation is taking place In many living organisms including in humans the
