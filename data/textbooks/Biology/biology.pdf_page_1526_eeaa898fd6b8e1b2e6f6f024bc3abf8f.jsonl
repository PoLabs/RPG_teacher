KEY TERMS
rapid branching through speciation of a phylogenetic tree into many closely related species
variety of a biological system typically conceived as the number of species but also applying to
genes biochemistry and ecosystems
concept originated by Norman Myers to describe a geographical region with a large
number of endemic species and a large percentage of degraded habitat
wildcaught animal used as food typically mammals birds and reptiles usually referring to hunting
in the tropics of subSaharan Africa Asia and the Americas
variety of metabolic compounds in an ecosystem
disease of amphibians caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis thought to be
a major cause of the global amphibian decline
molecular genetic method for identifying a unique genetic sequence to associate with a species
variety of ecosystems
species native to one place
also invasive species species that has been introduced to an ecosystem in which it did not
evolve
disappearance of a species from Earth local extinction is the disappearance of a species from a
region
number of species becoming extinct over time sometimes defined as extinctions per million
speciesyears to make numbers manageable EMSY
variety of genes in a species or other taxonomic group or ecosystem the term can refer to
allelic diversity or genomewide diversity
number of ecological niches
large animals
compound produced as byproducts of plant metabolic processes that is usually
toxic but is sequestered by the plant to defend against herbivores
relationship between area surveyed and number of species encountered typically
measured by incrementally increasing the area of a survey and determining the cumulative numbers of
species
economic principle that resources held in common will inevitably be overexploited
disease of cavehibernating bats in the eastern United States and Canada associated
with the fungus Geomyces destructans
CHAPTER SUMMARY
471 The Biodiversity Crisis
Biodiversity exists at multiple levels of organization and is measured in different ways depending on the
scientific goals of those taking the measurements These measurements include numbers of species genetic
diversity chemical diversity and ecosystem diversity The number of described species is estimated to be 15
million with about 17000 new species being described each year Estimates for the total number of species on
Earth vary but are on the order of 10 million Biodiversity is negatively correlated with latitude for most taxa
meaning that biodiversity is higher in the tropics The mechanism for this pattern is not known with certainty but
