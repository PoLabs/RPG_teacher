Figure 1417 Proofreading by DNA polymerase corrects errors during replication
Some errors are not corrected during replication but are instead corrected after replication is completed this
type of repair is known as mismatch repair Figure 1418 Specific repair enzymes recognize the mispaired
nucleotide and excise part of the strand that contains it the excised region is then resynthesized If the mismatch
remains uncorrected it may lead to more permanent damage when the mismatched DNA is replicated How do
mismatch repair enzymes recognize which of the two bases is the incorrect one In E coli after replication the
nitrogenous base adenine acquires a methyl group the parental DNA strand will have methyl groups whereas
the newly synthesized strand lacks them Thus DNA polymerase is able to remove the wrongly incorporated
bases from the newly synthesized nonmethylated strand In eukaryotes the mechanism is not very well
understood but it is believed to involve recognition of unsealed nicks in the new strand as well as a short
term continuing association of some of the replication proteins with the new daughter strand after replication has
completed
