fly amanita causes the pine tree to produce many small branched rootlets The Amanita hyphae cover these small
roots with a white mantle b Spores the round bodies and hyphae threadlike structures are evident in this light

Other examples of fungusplant mutualism include the endophytes fungi that live inside tissue without
damaging the host plant Endophytes release toxins that repel herbivores or confer resistance to environmental
stress factors such as infection by microorganisms drought or heavy metals in soil
