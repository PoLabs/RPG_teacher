Figure 4527 The tapeworm can live inside the intestine of the host for several years benefiting from the food
the host is eating and may grow to be over 50 ft long by adding segments The parasite moves from species to
species in a cycle making two hosts necessary to complete its life cycle
Another common parasite is Plasmodium falciparum the protozoan cause of malaria a significant disease in
many parts of the world Living in human liver and red blood cells the organism reproduces asexually in the
gut of bloodfeeding mosquitoes to complete its life cycle Thus malaria is spread from human to human by
mosquitoes one of many arthropodborne infectious diseases

Characteristics of Communities
Communities are complex entities that can be characterized by their structure the types and numbers of species
present and dynamics how communities change over time Understanding community structure and dynamics
enables community ecologists to manage ecosystems more effectively
Foundation Species
Foundation species are considered the base or bedrock of a community having the greatest influence on
its overall structure They are usually the primary producers organisms that bring most of the energy into the
community Kelp or brown algae is a foundation species forming the basis of the kelp forests off the coast of
California
Foundation species may physically modify the environment to produce and maintain habitats that benefit the
other organisms that use them An example is the photosynthetic corals of the coral reef Figure 4528
Corals themselves are not photosynthetic but harbor symbionts within their body tissues dinoflagellates called
zooxanthellae that perform photosynthesis this is another example of a mutualism The exoskeletons of living
and dead coral make up most of the reef structure which protects many other species from waves and ocean
currents
