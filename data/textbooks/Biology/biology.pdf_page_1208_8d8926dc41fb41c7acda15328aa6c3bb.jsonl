Decalcification of Bones
Question What effect does the removal of calcium and collagen have on bone structure
Background Conduct a literature search on the role of calcium and collagen in maintaining bone structure
Conduct a literature search on diseases in which bone structure is compromised
Hypothesis Develop a hypothesis that states predictions of the flexibility strength and mass of bones that
have had the calcium and collagen components removed Develop a hypothesis regarding the attempt to
add calcium back to decalcified bones
Test the hypothesis Test the prediction by removing calcium from chicken bones by placing them in a jar
of vinegar for seven days Test the hypothesis regarding adding calcium back to decalcified bone by placing
the decalcified chicken bones into a jar of water with calcium supplements added Test the prediction by
denaturing the collagen from the bones by baking them at 250C for three hours
Analyze the data Create a table showing the changes in bone flexibility strength and mass in the three
different environments
Report the results Under which conditions was the bone most flexible Under which conditions was the
bone the strongest
Draw a conclusion Did the results support or refute the hypothesis How do the results observed in this
experiment correspond to diseases that destroy bone tissue
383  Joints and Skeletal Movement
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Classify the different types of joints on the basis of structure

Explain the role of joints in skeletal movement
The point at which two or more bones meet is called a joint or articulation Joints are responsible for
movement such as the movement of limbs and stability such as the stability found in the bones of the skull
Classification of Joints on the Basis of Structure
There are two ways to classify joints on the basis of their structure or on the basis of their function The
structural classification divides joints into bony fibrous cartilaginous and synovial joints depending on the
material composing the joint and the presence or absence of a cavity in the joint
Fibrous Joints
The bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue There is no cavity or space present
between the bones and so most fibrous joints do not move at all or are only capable of minor movements There
are three types of fibrous joints sutures syndesmoses and gomphoses Sutures are found only in the skull and
possess short fibers of connective tissue that hold the skull bones tightly in place Figure 3823
