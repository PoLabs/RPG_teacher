CHAPTER SUMMARY
161 Regulation of Gene Expression
While all somatic cells within an organism contain the same DNA not all cells within that organism express the
same proteins Prokaryotic organisms express most of their genes most of the time However some genes are
expressed only when they are needed Eukaryotic organisms on the other hand express only a subset of their
genes in any given cell To express a protein the DNA is first transcribed into RNA which is then translated
into proteins which are then targeted to specific cellular locations In prokaryotic cells transcription and
translation occur almost simultaneously In eukaryotic cells transcription occurs in the nucleus and is separate
from the translation that occurs in the cytoplasm Gene expression in prokaryotes is mostly regulated at the
transcriptional level some epigenetic and posttranslational regulation is also present whereas in eukaryotic
cells gene expression is regulated at the epigenetic transcriptional posttranscriptional translational and
posttranslational levels
162 Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
The regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level There are two majors
kinds of proteins that control prokaryotic transcription repressors and activators Repressors bind to an
operator region to block the action of RNA polymerase Activators bind to the promoter to enhance the binding
of RNA polymerase Inducer molecules can increase transcription either by inactivating repressors or by
activating activator proteins In the trp operon the trp repressor is itself activated by binding to tryptophan
Therefore if tryptophan is not needed the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off The
lac operon is activated by the CAP catabolite activator protein which binds to the promoter to stabilize RNA
