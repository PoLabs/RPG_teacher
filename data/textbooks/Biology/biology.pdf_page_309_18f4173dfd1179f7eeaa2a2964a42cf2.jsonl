Mitotic Spindle Apparatus
The precise timing and formation of the mitotic spindle is critical to the success of eukaryotic cell division
Prokaryotic cells on the other hand do not undergo karyokinesis and therefore have no need for a mitotic
spindle However the FtsZ protein that plays such a vital role in prokaryotic cytokinesis is structurally
and functionally very similar to tubulin the building block of the microtubules which make up the mitotic
spindle fibers that are necessary for eukaryotic nuclear division FtsZ proteins can form filaments rings
and other threedimensional structures that resemble the way tubulin forms microtubules centrioles and
various cytoskeletal components In addition both FtsZ and tubulin employ the same energy source GTP
guanosine triphosphate to rapidly assemble and disassemble complex structures
FtsZ and tubulin are considered to be homologous structures derived from common evolutionary origins In
this example FtsZ is the ancestor protein to tubulin an evolutionarily derived protein While both proteins
are found in extant organisms tubulin function has evolved and diversified tremendously since evolving
from its FtsZ prokaryotic origin A survey of mitotic assembly components found in presentday unicellular
eukaryotes reveals crucial intermediary steps to the complex membraneenclosed genomes of multicellular
eukaryotes Table 103

Prokaryotes
There is no nucleus
The single circular
chromosome exists in a
region of cytoplasm
called the nucleoid
Occurs through binary fission As the
chromosome is replicated the two copies move
to opposite ends of the cell by an unknown
mechanism
FtsZ proteins
assemble into a
ring that
pinches the cell
in two
Some
protists
Linear chromosomes
exist in the nucleus
Chromosomes attach to the nuclear envelope
which remains intact The mitotic spindle passes
through the envelope and elongates the cell No
centrioles exist
Microfilaments
form a
cleavage
furrow that
pinches the cell
in two
Other
protists
Linear chromosomes
wrapped around
histones exist in the
nucleus
A mitotic spindle forms from the centrioles and
passes through the nuclear membrane which
remains intact Chromosomes attach to the
mitotic spindle which separates the
chromosomes and elongates the cell
Microfilaments
form a
cleavage
furrow that
pinches the cell
in two
Animal cells Linear chromosomes
exist in the nucleus
A mitotic spindle forms from the centrosomes
The nuclear envelope dissolves Chromosomes
attach to the mitotic spindle which separates the
chromosomes and elongates the cell
Microfilaments
form a
cleavage
furrow that
pinches the cell
