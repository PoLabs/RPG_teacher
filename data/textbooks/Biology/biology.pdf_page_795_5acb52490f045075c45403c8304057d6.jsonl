KEY TERMS
animal without a body cavity
type of symmetry in which there is only one plane of symmetry so the left and right halves
of an animal are mirror images
opening into the archenteron that forms during gastrulation
1632 cell stage of development of an animal embryo
morphology or defining shape of an organism
time during the Cambrian period 542488 million years ago when most of the animal
phyla in existence today evolved
cell divisions subdividing a fertilized egg zygote to form a multicellular embryo
lined body cavity
geologic period 850630 million years ago characterized by a very cold global climate
cleavage pattern in which developmental fate of each blastomere is tightly defined
blastopore develops into the anus with the second opening developing into the mouth
animal that develops from two germ layers
clade of protostomes that exhibit exoskeletal molting ecdysis
geological period 630542 million years ago when the oldest definite multicellular
organisms with tissues evolved
mesoderm of deuterostomes develops as pouches that are pinched off from endodermal tissue
cavity contained within the pouches becomes coelom
animal with a body cavity completely lined with mesodermal tissue
group of animals with true differentiated tissues
stage of animal development characterized by the formation of the digestive cavity
collection of cells formed during embryogenesis that will give rise to future body tissues more
pronounced in vertebrate embryogenesis
also homeobox gene master control gene that can turn on or off large numbers of other genes
during embryogenesis
cleavage pattern in which individual blastomeres have the character of stem cells
and are not yet predetermined to develop into specific cell types
clade of protostomes that exhibit a trochophore larvae stage or a lophophore feeding
structure
event or environmental condition that wipes out the majority of species within a relatively short
geological time period
group containing all animals
formation of organs in animal embryogenesis
group of animals without true differentiated tissues
