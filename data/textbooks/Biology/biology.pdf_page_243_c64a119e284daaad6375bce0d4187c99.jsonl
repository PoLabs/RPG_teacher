What Is Light Energy
The sun emits an enormous amount of electromagnetic radiation solar energy in a spectrum from very short
gamma rays to very long radio waves Humans can see only a tiny fraction of this energy which we refer to
as visible light The manner in which solar energy travels is described as waves Scientists can determine the
amount of energy of a wave by measuring its wavelength shorter wavelengths are more powerful than longer
wavelengthsthe distance between consecutive crest points of a wave Therefore a single wave is measured
from two consecutive points such as from crest to crest or from trough to trough Figure 810
Figure 810 The wavelength of a single wave is the distance between two consecutive points of similar position two
crests or two troughs along the wave
Visible light constitutes only one of many types of electromagnetic radiation emitted from the sun and other stars
Scientists differentiate the various types of radiant energy from the sun within the electromagnetic spectrum The
electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of radiation Figure 811 The difference
between wavelengths relates to the amount of energy carried by them
