Figure 85 The basic equation for photosynthesis is deceptively simple In reality the process takes place in many
steps involving intermediate reactants and products Glucose the primary energy source in cells is made from two
threecarbon GA3Ps
Although the equation looks simple the many steps that take place during photosynthesis are actually quite
complex Before learning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food it is important to become
familiar with the structures involved
Basic Photosynthetic Structures
In plants photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves which consist of several layers of cells The process
of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and
oxygen occurs through small regulated openings called stomata singular stoma which also play roles in the
regulation of gas exchange and water balance The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf
which helps to minimize water loss due to high temperatures on the upper surface of the leaf Each stoma is
flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response
to osmotic changes
In all autotrophic eukaryotes photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast For plants
chloroplastcontaining cells exist mostly in the mesophyll Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope
composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane and are ancestrally derived from ancient freeliving
cyanobacteria Within the chloroplast are stacked discshaped structures called thylakoids Embedded in the
thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll a pigment molecule that absorbs light responsible for the initial interaction
between light and plant material and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain The thylakoid
membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen As shown in Figure 86 a stack of thylakoids
is called a granum and the liquidfilled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or bed not to be
confused with stoma or mouth an opening on the leaf epidermis
Figure 86 Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts which have an outer membrane and an inner membrane
Stacks of thylakoids called grana form a third membrane layer
On a hot dry day the guard cells of plants close their stomata to conserve water What impact will this have
