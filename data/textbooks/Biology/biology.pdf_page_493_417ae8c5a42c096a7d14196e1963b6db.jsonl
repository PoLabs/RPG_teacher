Researchers use information that they obtain from proteomics to identify novel drugs and to understand their
mechanisms of action
Figure 1717 Scientists use twohybrid screening to determine whether two proteins interact In this method a
transcription factor splits into a DNAbinding domain BD and an activator domain AD The binding domain is able to
bind the promoter in the activator domains absence but it does not turn on transcription The bait protein attaches to
the BD and the prey protein attaches to the AD Transcription occurs only if the prey catches the bait
Scientists are challenged when implementing proteomic analysis because it is difficult to detect small protein
quantities Although mass spectrometry is good for detecting small protein amounts variations in protein
expression in diseased states can be difficult to discern Proteins are naturally unstable molecules which makes
proteomic analysis much more difficult than genomic analysis
Cancer Proteomics
Researchers are studying patients genomes and proteomes to understand the genetic basis of diseases The
most prominent disease researchers are studying with proteomic approaches is cancer These approaches
improve screening and early cancer detection Researchers are able to identify proteins whose expression
indicates the disease process An individual protein is a biomarker whereas a set of proteins with altered
expression levels is a protein signature For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for
early cancer screening and detection they must secrete in body fluids such as sweat blood or urine such
that health professionals can perform largescale screenings in a noninvasive fashion The current problem with
using biomarkers for early cancer detection is the high rate of falsenegative results A false negative is an
incorrect test result that should have been positive In other words many cancer cases go undetected which
makes biomarkers unreliable Some examples of protein biomarkers in cancer detection are CA125 for ovarian
cancer and PSA for prostate cancer Protein signatures may be more reliable than biomarkers to detect cancer
cells Researchers are also using proteomics to develop individualized treatment plans which involves predicting
whether or not an individual will respond to specific drugs and the side effects that the individual may experience
Researchers also use proteomics to predict the possibility of disease recurrence
The National Cancer Institute has developed programs to improve cancer detection and treatment The Clinical
Proteomic Technologies for Cancer and the Early Detection Research Network are efforts to identify protein
signatures specific to different cancer types The Biomedical Proteomics Program identifies protein signatures
and designs effective therapies for cancer patients
