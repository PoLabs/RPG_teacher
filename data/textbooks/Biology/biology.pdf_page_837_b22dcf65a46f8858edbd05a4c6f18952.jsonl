Morphology and Physiology
Tardigrades have cylindrical bodies with four pairs of legs terminating in a number of claws The cuticle is
periodically shed including the cuticular covering of the claws The first three pairs of legs are used for walking
and the posterior pair for clinging to the substrate A circular mouth leads to a muscular pharynx and salivary
glands Tardigrades feed on plants algae or small animals Plant cells are pierced with a chitinous stylet and
the cellular contents are then sucked into the gut by the muscular pharynx Bands of single muscle cells are
attached to the various points of the epidermis and extend into the legs to provide ambulatory movement The
major body cavity is a hemocoel but there are no specialized circulatory structures for moving the blood nor
are there specialized respiratory structures Malpighian tubules in the hemocoel remove metabolic wastes and
transport them to the gut A dorsal brain is connected to a ventral nerve cord with segmental ganglia associated
with the appendages Sensory structures are greatly reduced but there is a pair of simple eyespots on the head
and sensory cilia or bristles concentrated toward the head end of the animal
Reproduction
Most tardigrades are dioecious and males and females each have a single gonad Mating usually occurs at the
time of a molt and fertilization is external Eggs may be deposited in a molted cuticle or attached to other objects
Development is direct and the animal may molt a dozen times during its lifetime In tardigrades like nematodes
development produces a fixed number of cells with the actual number of cells being dependent on the species
Further growth occurs by enlarging the cells not by multiplying them
286  Superphylum Ecdysozoa Arthropods
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Compare the internal systems and appendage specializations of phylum Arthropoda

Discuss the environmental importance of arthropods

Discuss the reasons for arthropod success and abundance
The superphylum Ecdysozoa also includes the phylum Arthropoda one of the most successful clades of animals
on the planet Arthropods are coelomate organisms characterized by a sturdy chitinous exoskeleton and jointed
appendages There are well over a million arthropod species described and systematists believe that there are
millions of species awaiting proper classification Like other Ecdysozoa all arthropods periodically go through
the physiological process of molting followed by ecdysis the actual shedding of the exoskeleton as they
