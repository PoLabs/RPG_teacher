Regulatory proteins such as troponin and tropomyosin control crossbridge formation Excitationcontraction
coupling transduces the electrical signal of the neuron via acetylcholine to an electrical signal on the muscle
membrane which initiates force production The number of muscle fibers contracting determines how much
force the whole muscle produces
