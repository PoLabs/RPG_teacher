Figure 465 The relative energy in trophic levels in a Silver Springs Florida ecosystem is shown Each trophic level
has less energy available and supports fewer organisms at the next level
There is a one problem when using food chains to accurately describe most ecosystems Even when all
organisms are grouped into appropriate trophic levels some of these organisms can feed on species from more
than one trophic level likewise some of these organisms can be eaten by species from multiple trophic levels
In other words the linear model of ecosystems the food chain is not completely descriptive of ecosystem
structure A holistic modelwhich accounts for all the interactions between different species and their complex
interconnected relationships with each other and with the environmentis a more accurate and descriptive
model for ecosystems A food web is a graphic representation of a holistic nonlinear web of primary producers
primary consumers and higherlevel consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics Figure

Figure 466 This food web shows the interactions between organisms across trophic levels in the Lake Ontario
ecosystem Primary producers are outlined in green primary consumers in orange secondary consumers in blue and
tertiary apex consumers in purple Arrows point from an organism that is consumed to the organism that consumes
it Notice how some lines point to more than one trophic level For example the opossum shrimp eats both primary
producers and primary consumers credit NOAA GLERL
A comparison of the two types of structural ecosystem models shows strength in both Food chains are more
flexible for analytical modeling are easier to follow and are easier to experiment with whereas food web
models more accurately represent ecosystem structure and dynamics and data can be directly used as input for
simulation modeling
