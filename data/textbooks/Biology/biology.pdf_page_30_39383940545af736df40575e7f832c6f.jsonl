Organisms are highly organized coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells Even very simple
singlecelled organisms are remarkably complex inside each cell atoms comprise molecules These in turn
comprise cell organelles and other cellular inclusions In multicellular organisms Figure 110 similar cells form
tissues Tissues in turn collaborate to create organs body structures with a distinct function Organs work
together to form organ systems
Sensitivity or Response to Stimuli
Figure 111 The leaves of this sensitive plant Mimosa pudica will instantly droop and fold when touched After a few
minutes the plant returns to normal credit Alex Lomas
Organisms respond to diverse stimuli For example plants can bend toward a source of light climb on fences
and walls or respond to touch Figure 111 Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals
a process called chemotaxis or light phototaxis Movement toward a stimulus is a positive response while
movement away from a stimulus is a negative response
