stimulate the uptake of amino acids from the blood allowing the formation of new proteins particularly in skeletal
muscle cells cartilage cells and other target cells as shown in Figure 3713 This is especially important after
a meal when glucose and amino acid concentration levels are high in the blood GH levels are regulated by two
hormones produced by the hypothalamus GH release is stimulated by growth hormonereleasing hormone
GHRH and is inhibited by growth hormoneinhibiting hormone GHIH also called somatostatin
Figure 3713 Growth hormone directly accelerates the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and bones Insulin
like growth factor 1 IGF1 is activated by growth hormone and also allows formation of new proteins in muscle cells
and bone credit modification of work by Mikael Hggstrm
A balanced production of growth hormone is critical for proper development Underproduction of GH in adults
does not appear to cause any abnormalities but in children it can result in pituitary dwarfism in which growth is
reduced Pituitary dwarfism is characterized by symmetric body formation In some cases individuals are under
30 inches in height Oversecretion of growth hormone can lead to gigantism in children causing excessive
growth In some documented cases individuals can reach heights of over eight feet In adults excessive GH
can lead to acromegaly a condition in which there is enlargement of bones in the face hands and feet that are
still capable of growth
