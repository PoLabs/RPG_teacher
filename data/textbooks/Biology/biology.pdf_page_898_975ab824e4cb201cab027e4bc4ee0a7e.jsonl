Apes evolved from the catarrhines in Africa midway through the Cenozoic approximately 25 million years ago
Apes are generally larger than monkeys and they do not possess a tail All apes are capable of moving through
trees although many species spend most their time on the ground When walking quadrupedally monkeys walk
on their palms while apes support the upper body on their knuckles Apes are more intelligent than monkeys
and they have larger brains relative to body size The apes are divided into two groups The lesser apes
comprise the family Hylobatidae including gibbons and siamangs The great apes include the genera Pan
chimpanzees and bonobos Gorilla gorillas Pongo orangutans and Homo humans Figure 2944

The very arboreal gibbons are smaller than the great apes they have low sexual dimorphism that is the
sexes are not markedly different in size although in some species the sexes differ in color and they have
relatively longer arms used for swinging through trees Figure 2945a Two species of orangutan are native
to different islands in Indonesia Borneo P pygmaeus and Sumatra P abelii A third orangutan species
Pongo tapanuliensis was reported in 2017 from the Batang Toru forest in Sumatra Orangutans are arboreal
and solitary Males are much larger than females and have cheek and throat pouches when mature Gorillas
all live in Central Africa The eastern and western populations are recognized as separate species G berengei
and G gorilla Gorillas are strongly sexually dimorphic with males about twice the size of females In older
males called silverbacks the hair on the back turns white or gray Chimpanzees Figure 2945b are the species
considered to be most closely related to humans However the species most closely related to the chimpanzee
is the bonobo Genetic evidence suggests that chimpanzee and human lineages separated 5 to 7 MYA while
