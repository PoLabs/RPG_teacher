finned fish and legged tetrapods sometimes called a fishapod credit Zina Deretsky National Science Foundation
The early tetrapods that moved onto land had access to new nutrient sources and relatively few predators This
led to the widespread distribution of tetrapods during the early Carboniferous period a period sometimes called
the age of the amphibians
Modern Amphibians
Amphibia comprises an estimated 6770 extant species that inhabit tropical and temperate regions around the
world All living species are classified in the subclass Lissamphibia smoothamphibian which is divided into
three clades Urodela tailed the salamanders Anura tailless the frogs and Apoda legless ones the
caecilians
Urodela Salamanders
Salamanders are amphibians that belong to the order Urodela or Caudata These animals are probably the
most similar to ancestral amphibians Living salamanders Figure 2918 include approximately 620 species
some of which are aquatic others terrestrial and some that live on land only as adults Most adult salamanders
have a generalized tetrapod body plan with four limbs and a tail The placement of their legs makes it difficult to
lift their bodies off the ground and they move by bending their bodies from side to side called lateral undulation
in a fishlike manner while walking their arms and legs foreandaft It is thought that their gait is similar to that
used by early tetrapods The majority of salamanders are lungless and respiration occurs through the skin or
through external gills in aquatic species Some terrestrial salamanders have primitive lungs a few species have
both gills and lungs The giant Japanese salamander the largest living amphibian has additional folds in its skin
that enlarge its respiratory surface
Most salamanders reproduce using an unusual process of internal fertilization of the eggs Mating between
salamanders typically involves an elaborate and often prolonged courtship Such a courtship ends in the
deposition of sperm by the males in a packet called a spermatophore which is subsequently picked up
by the female thus ultimately fertilization is internal All salamanders except one the fire salamander are
oviparous Aquatic salamanders lay their eggs in water where they develop into legless larvae called efts
Terrestrial salamanders lay their eggs in damp nests where the eggs are guarded by their mothers These
embryos go through the larval stage and complete metamorphosis before hatching into tiny adult forms One
aquatic salamander the Mexican axolotl never leaves the larval stage becoming sexually mature without
metamorphosis
