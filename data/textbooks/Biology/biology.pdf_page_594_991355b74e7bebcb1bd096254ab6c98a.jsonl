CHAPTER SUMMARY
211 Viral Evolution Morphology and Classification
Viruses are tiny noncellular entities that usually can be seen only with an electron microscope Their genomes
contain either DNA or RNAnever bothand they replicate either by using the replication proteins of a host
cell or by using proteins encoded in the viral genome Viruses are diverse infecting archaea bacteria fungi
plants and animals Viruses consist of a nucleic acid core surrounded by a protein capsid with or without an
outer lipid envelope The capsid shape presence of an envelope and core composition dictate some elements
of the classification of viruses The most commonly used classification method the Baltimore classification
categorizes viruses based on how they produce their mRNA
