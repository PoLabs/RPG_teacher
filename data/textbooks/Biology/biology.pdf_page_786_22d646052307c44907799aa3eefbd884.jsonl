Constructing an Animal Phylogenetic Tree
The current understanding of evolutionary relationships among animal or Metazoa phyla begins with the
distinction between animals with true differentiated tissues called Eumetazoa and animal phyla that do not
have true differentiated tissues such as the sponges  Porifera and the Placozoa Similarities between the
feeding cells of sponges choanocytes and choanoflagellate protists Figure 2712 have been used to suggest
that Metazoa evolved from a common ancestral organism that resembled the moderncolonial choanoflagellates
Figure 2712 Choanoflagellates and choanocytes Cells of the protist choanoflagellate clade closely resemble sponge
choanocyte cells Beating of choanocyte flagella draws water through the sponge so that nutrients can be extracted
and waste removed
Eumetazoa are subdivided into radially symmetrical animals and bilaterally symmetrical animals and are
thus classified into the clades Bilateria and Radiata respectively As mentioned earlier the cnidarians and
ctenophores are animal phyla with true radial biradial or rotational symmetry All other Eumetazoa are members
of the Bilateria clade The bilaterally symmetrical animals are further divided into deuterostomes including
chordates
and
echinoderms
and
two
distinct
clades
of
protostomes
including
ecdysozoans
and
lophotrochozoans Figure 2713ab Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods they are so named for
a commonly found characteristic among the group the physiological process of exoskeletal molting followed by
the stripping of the outer cuticular layer called ecdysis Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features
each common to certain phyla within the clade Some lophotrochozoan phyla are characterized by a larval stage
called trochophore larvae and other phyla are characterized by the presence of a feeding structure called a
lophophore thus the shorter term lophotrochozoa

are in the clade Ecdysozoa b Phoronids are in the clade Lophotrochozoa The tentacles are part of a feeding
