102  The Cell Cycle
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the three stages of interphase

Discuss the behavior of chromosomes during karyokinesismitosis

Explain how the cytoplasmic content is divided during cytokinesis

Define the quiescent G0 phase
The cell cycle is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new
daughter cells Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully
regulated stages of growth DNA replication and nuclear and cytoplasmic division that ultimately produces two
identical clone cells The cell cycle has two major phases interphase and the mitotic phase Figure 105
During interphase the cell grows and DNA is replicated During the mitotic phase the replicated DNA and
cytoplasmic contents are separated and the cell cytoplasm is typically partitioned by a third process of the cell
cycle called cytokinesis We should note however that interphase and mitosis kayrokinesis may take place
without cytokinesis in which case cells with multiple nuclei multinucleate cells are produced
Figure 105 The cell cycle in multicellular organisms consists of interphase and the mitotic phase During interphase
the cell grows and the nuclear DNA is duplicated Interphase is followed by the mitotic phase During the mitotic phase
the duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei Following mitosis the cytoplasm is
usually divided as well by cytokinesis resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells
Interphase
During interphase the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for cell division In order for
a cell to move from interphase into the mitotic phase many internal and external conditions must be met The
three stages of interphase are called G1 S and G2
G1 Phase First Gap
The first stage of interphase is called the G1 phase first gap because from a microscopic point of view little
