prolactin PRL in females Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following
childbirth Prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactinreleasing hormone PRH
and prolactininhibiting hormone PIH which is now known to be dopamine PRH stimulates the release of
prolactin and PIH inhibits it
The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth
The uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of
oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks Stretching of tissues in the uterus and cervix stimulates oxytocin release
during childbirth Contractions increase in intensity as blood levels of oxytocin rise via a positive feedback
mechanism until the birth is complete Oxytocin also stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells around the
milkproducing mammary glands As these cells contract milk is forced from the secretory alveoli into milk ducts
and is ejected from the breasts in milk ejection letdown reflex Oxytocin release is stimulated by the suckling
of an infant which triggers the synthesis of oxytocin in the hypothalamus and its release into circulation at the
posterior pituitary
Hormonal Regulation of Metabolism
Blood glucose levels vary widely over the course of a day as periods of food consumption alternate with periods
of fasting Insulin and glucagon are the two hormones primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis of blood
glucose levels Additional regulation is mediated by the thyroid hormones
Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Insulin and Glucagon
Cells of the body require nutrients in order to function and these nutrients are obtained through feeding In order
to manage nutrient intake storing excess intake and utilizing reserves when necessary the body uses hormones
to moderate energy stores Insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas which are stimulated to release
insulin as blood glucose levels rise for example after a meal is consumed Insulin lowers blood glucose levels
by enhancing the rate of glucose uptake and utilization by target cells which use glucose for ATP production It
also stimulates the liver to convert glucose to glycogen which is then stored by cells for later use Insulin also
increases glucose transport into certain cells such as muscle cells and the liver This results from an insulin
mediated increase in the number of glucose transporter proteins in cell membranes which remove glucose from
circulation by facilitated diffusion As insulin binds to its target cell via insulin receptors and signal transduction it
triggers the cell to incorporate glucose transport proteins into its membrane This allows glucose to enter the cell
where it can be used as an energy source However this does not occur in all cells some cells including those
in the kidneys and brain can access glucose without the use of insulin Insulin also stimulates the conversion
of glucose to fat in adipocytes and the synthesis of proteins These actions mediated by insulin cause blood
glucose concentrations to fall called a hypoglycemic low sugar effect which inhibits further insulin release from
beta cells through a negative feedback loop

Impaired insulin function can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus the main symptoms of which are
illustrated in Figure 3710 This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the
pancreas or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells
causing high levels of blood glucose or hyperglycemia high sugar High blood glucose levels make it difficult
for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine resulting in glucose being lost in urine High glucose
levels also result in less water being reabsorbed by the kidneys causing high amounts of urine to be produced
this may result in dehydration Over time high blood glucose levels can cause nerve damage to the eyes and
peripheral body tissues as well as damage to the kidneys and cardiovascular system Oversecretion of insulin
can cause hypoglycemia low blood glucose levels This causes insufficient glucose availability to cells often
leading to muscle weakness and can sometimes cause unconsciousness or death if left untreated
