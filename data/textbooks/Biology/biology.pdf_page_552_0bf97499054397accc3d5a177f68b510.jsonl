Recent genetic analysis and other advancements have found that some earlier phylogenetic classifications do
not align with the evolutionary past therefore researchers must make changes and updates as new discoveries
occur Recall that phylogenetic trees are hypotheses and are modified as data becomes available In addition
classification historically has focused on grouping organisms mainly by shared characteristics and does not
necessarily illustrate how the various groups relate to each other from an evolutionary perspective For example
despite the fact that a hippopotamus resembles a pig more than a whale the hippopotamus may be the whales
closest living relative
202  Determining Evolutionary Relationships
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Compare homologous and analogous traits

Discuss the purpose of cladistics

Describe maximum parsimony
Scientists must collect accurate information that allows them to make evolutionary connections among
organisms Similar to detective work scientists must use evidence to uncover the facts In the case of phylogeny
evolutionary investigations focus on two types of evidence morphologic form and function and genetic
Two Options for Similarities
In general organisms that share similar physical features and genomes are more closely related than those that
do not We refer to such features that overlap both morphologically in form and genetically as homologous
structures They stem from developmental similarities that are based on evolution For example the bones in
bat and bird wings have homologous structures Figure 207
Figure 207 Bat and bird wings are homologous structures indicating that bats and birds share a common evolutionary
past credit a modification of work by Steve Hillebrand USFWS credit b modification of work by US DOI BLM
Notice it is not simply a single bone but rather a grouping of several bones arranged in a similar way The more
complex the feature the more likely any kind of overlap is due to a common evolutionary past Imagine two
people from different countries both inventing a car with all the same parts and in exactly the same arrangement
without any previous or shared knowledge That outcome would be highly improbable However if two people
both invented a hammer we can reasonably conclude that both could have the original idea without the help
of the other The same relationship between complexity and shared evolutionary history is true for homologous
structures in organisms
Misleading Appearances
Some organisms may be very closely related even though a minor genetic change caused a major
morphological difference to make them look quite different Similarly unrelated organisms may be distantly
related but appear very much alike This usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations
