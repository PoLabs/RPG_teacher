Figure 3813 To adapt to reproductive fitness the a female pelvis is lighter wider shallower and has a broader angle
between the pubic bones than b the male pelvis
The Lower Limb
The lower limb consists of the thigh the leg and the foot The bones of the lower limb are the femur thigh
bone patella kneecap tibia and fibula bones of the leg tarsals bones of the ankle and metatarsals and
phalanges bones of the foot Figure 3814 The bones of the lower limbs are thicker and stronger than the
bones of the upper limbs because of the need to support the entire weight of the body and the resulting forces
from locomotion In addition to evolutionary fitness the bones of an individual will respond to forces exerted
upon them
Figure 3814 The lower limb consists of the thigh femur kneecap patella leg tibia and fibula ankle tarsals and
foot metatarsals and phalanges bones
The femur or thighbone is the longest heaviest and strongest bone in the body The femur and pelvis form
the hip joint at the proximal end At the distal end the femur tibia and patella form the knee joint The patella
or kneecap is a triangular bone that lies anterior to the knee joint The patella is embedded in the tendon of
the femoral extensors quadriceps It improves knee extension by reducing friction The tibia or shinbone is a
large bone of the leg that is located directly below the knee The tibia articulates with the femur at its proximal
end with the fibula and the tarsal bones at its distal end It is the second largest bone in the human body and is
responsible for transmitting the weight of the body from the femur to the foot The fibula or calf bone parallels
and articulates with the tibia It does not articulate with the femur and does not bear weight The fibula acts as a
site for muscle attachment and forms the lateral part of the ankle joint
