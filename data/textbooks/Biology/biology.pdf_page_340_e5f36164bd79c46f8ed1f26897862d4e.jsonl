Figure 123 In one of his experiments on inheritance patterns Mendel crossed plants that were truebreeding for
violet flower color with plants truebreeding for white flower color the P generation The resulting hybrids in the F1
generation all had violet flowers In the F2 generation approximately three quarters of the plants had violet flowers
and one quarter had white flowers
Garden Pea Characteristics Revealed the Basics of Heredity
In his 1865 publication Mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics each
with two contrasting traits A trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic
The characteristics included plant height seed texture seed color flower color pea pod size pea pod color and
flower position For the characteristic of flower color for example the two contrasting traits were white versus
violet To fully examine each characteristic Mendel generated large numbers of F1 and F2 plants reporting
results from 19959 F2 plants alone His findings were consistent
What results did Mendel find in his crosses for flower color First Mendel confirmed that he had plants that
bred true for white or violet flower color Regardless of how many generations Mendel examined all selfcrossed
offspring of parents with white flowers had white flowers and all selfcrossed offspring of parents with violet
flowers had violet flowers In addition Mendel confirmed that other than flower color the pea plants were
