nature have affected humans and their ancestors for millions of years The true cause of these diseases was not
understood until modern scientific thought developed and many people thought that diseases were a spiritual
punishment Only within the past several centuries have people understood that staying away from afflicted
persons disposing of the corpses and personal belongings of victims of illness and sanitation practices reduced
their own chances of getting sick
Epidemiologists study how diseases are transmitted and how they affect a population Often they must following
the course of an epidemica disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at
the same time In contrast a pandemic is a widespread and usually worldwide epidemic An endemic disease
is a disease that is always present usually at low incidence in a population
Long History of Bacterial Disease
There are records about infectious diseases as far back as 3000 BC A number of significant pandemics caused
by bacteria have been documented over several hundred years Some of the most memorable pandemics led to
the decline of cities and entire nations
In the 21st century infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide despite advances
made in medical research and treatments in recent decades A disease spreads when the pathogen that causes
it is passed from one person to another For a pathogen to cause disease it must be able to reproduce in the
hosts body and damage the host in some way
The Plague of Athens
In 430 BC the Plague of Athens killed onequarter of the Athenian troops who were fighting in the great
Peloponnesian War and weakened Athenss dominance and power The plague impacted people living in
overcrowded Athens as well as troops aboard ships that had to return to Athens The source of the plague
may have been identified recently when researchers from the University of Athens were able to use DNA from
teeth recovered from a mass grave The scientists identified nucleotide sequences from a pathogenic bacterium
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi Figure 2220 which causes typhoid fever

This disease is commonly seen
in overcrowded areas and has caused epidemics throughout recorded history
