Veterinarian
Veterinarians are concerned with diseases disorders and injuries in animals primarily vertebrates They
treat pets livestock and animals in zoos and laboratories Veterinarians often treat dogs and cats but also
take care of birds reptiles rabbits and other animals that are kept as pets Veterinarians that work with
farms and ranches care for pigs goats cows sheep and horses
Veterinarians are required to complete a degree in veterinary medicine which includes taking courses in
comparative zoology animal anatomy and physiology microbiology and pathology among many other
courses in chemistry physics and mathematics
Veterinarians are also trained to perform surgery on many different vertebrate species which requires an
understanding of the vastly different anatomies of various species For example the stomach of ruminants
like cows has four compartments versus one compartment for nonruminants As we have seen birds also
have unique anatomical adaptations that allow for flight which requires additional training and care
Some veterinarians conduct research in academic settings broadening our knowledge of animals and
medical science One area of research involves understanding the transmission of animal diseases to
humans called zoonotic diseases For example one area of great concern is the transmission of the
avian flu virus to humans One type of avian flu virus H5N1 is a highly pathogenic strain that has been
spreading in birds in Asia Europe Africa and the Middle East Although the virus does not cross over easily
to humans there have been cases of birdtohuman transmission More research is needed to understand
how this virus can cross the species barrier and how its spread can be prevented

By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Name and describe the distinguishing features of the three main groups of mammals

Describe the likely line of evolutionary descent that produced mammals

List some derived features that may have arisen in response to mammals need for constant highlevel
metabolism
