Figure 715 Fermentation of grape juice into wine produces CO2 as a byproduct Fermentation tanks have valves so
that the pressure inside the tanks created by the carbon dioxide produced can be released
Other Types of Fermentation
Other fermentation methods take place in bacteria We should note that many prokaryotes are facultatively
anaerobic This means that they can switch between aerobic respiration and fermentation depending on the
availability of free oxygen Certain prokaryotes such as Clostridia are obligate anaerobes Obligate anaerobes
live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen Oxygen is a poison to these microorganisms and kills them on
exposure We should also note that all forms of fermentation except lactic acid fermentation produce gas The
production of particular types of gas is used as an indicator of the fermentation of specific carbohydrates which
plays a role in the laboratory identification of the bacteria Various methods of fermentation are used by assorted
organisms to ensure an adequate supply of NAD for the sixth step in glycolysis Without these pathways this
step would not occur and ATP could not be harvested from the breakdown of glucose
76  Connections of Carbohydrate Protein and Lipid
Metabolic Pathways
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the ways in which carbohydrate metabolic pathways glycolysis and the citric acid cycle
interrelate with protein and lipid metabolic pathways

Explain why metabolic pathways are not considered closed systems
You have learned about the catabolism of glucose which provides energy to living cells But living things
consume organic compounds other than glucose for food How does a turkey sandwich end up as ATP in your
cells This happens because all of the catabolic pathways for carbohydrates proteins and lipids eventually
connect into glycolysis and the citric acid cycle pathways see Figure 717 Metabolic pathways should be
thought of as porous and interconnectingthat is substances enter from other pathways and intermediates
leave for other pathways These pathways are not closed systems Many of the substrates intermediates and
products in a particular pathway are reactants in other pathways
Connections of Other Sugars to Glucose Metabolism
Glycogen a polymer of glucose is an energy storage molecule in animals When there is adequate ATP
present excess glucose is stored as glycogen in both liver and muscle cells The glycogen will be hydrolyzed
into glucose 1phosphate monomers G1P if blood sugar levels drop The presence of glycogen as a source
of glucose allows ATP to be produced for a longer period of time during exercise Glycogen is broken down into
