Figure 162 Regulation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes Prokaryotic transcription and translation occur simultaneously
in the cytoplasm and regulation occurs at the transcriptional level Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated during
transcription and RNA processing which take place in the nucleus and during protein translation which takes place
in the cytoplasm Further regulation may occur through posttranslational modifications of proteins
The differences in the regulation of gene expression between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are summarized in
Table 161 The regulation of gene expression is discussed in detail in subsequent modules
Differences in the Regulation of Gene Expression of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic
Organisms
Prokaryotic organisms
Eukaryotic organisms
Lack a membranebound nucleus
Contain nucleus
DNA is found in the cytoplasm
DNA is confined to the nuclear compartment
RNA transcription and protein
formation occur almost
simultaneously
RNA transcription occurs prior to protein formation and it takes place in
the nucleus Translation of RNA to protein occurs in the cytoplasm
Gene expression is regulated
primarily at the transcriptional
level
Gene expression is regulated at many levels epigenetic transcriptional
nuclear shuttling posttranscriptional translational and posttranslational
