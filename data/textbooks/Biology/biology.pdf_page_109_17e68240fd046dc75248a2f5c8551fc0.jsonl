Figure 333 In a double stranded DNA molecule the two strands run antiparallel to one another so that one strand
runs 5 to 3 and the other 3 to 5 The phosphate backbone is located on the outside and the bases are in the
middle Adenine forms hydrogen bonds or base pairs with thymine and guanine base pairs with cytosine
A mutation occurs and adenine replaces cytosine What impact do you think this will have on the DNA
structure
RNA
Ribonucleic acid or RNA is mainly involved in the process of protein synthesis under the direction of DNA
RNA is usually singlestranded and is comprised of ribonucleotides that are linked by phosphodiester bonds A
ribonucleotide in the RNA chain contains ribose the pentose sugar one of the four nitrogenous bases A U G
and C and the phosphate group
There are four major types of RNA messenger RNA mRNA ribosomal RNA rRNA transfer RNA tRNA and
microRNA miRNA The first mRNA carries the message from DNA which controls all of the cellular activities
in a cell If a cell requires synthesizing a certain protein the gene for this product turns on and the messenger
RNA synthesizes in the nucleus The RNA base sequence is complementary to the DNAs coding sequence from
which it has been copied However in RNA the base T is absent and U is present instead If the DNA strand
has a sequence AATTGCGC the sequence of the complementary RNA is UUAACGCG In the cytoplasm the
mRNA interacts with ribosomes and other cellular machinery Figure 334
Figure 334 A ribosome has two parts a large subunit and a small subunit The mRNA sits in between the two
subunits A tRNA molecule recognizes a codon on the mRNA binds to it by complementary base pairing and adds
the correct amino acid to the growing peptide chain
The mRNA is read in sets of three bases known as codons Each codon codes for a single amino acid In this
way the mRNA is read and the protein product is made Ribosomal RNA rRNA is a major constituent of
