Braincomputer interface
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS also called Lou Gehrigs Disease is a neurological disease
characterized by the degeneration of the motor neurons that control voluntary movements The disease
begins with muscle weakening and lack of coordination and eventually destroys the neurons that control
speech breathing and swallowing in the end the disease can lead to paralysis At that point patients
require assistance from machines to be able to breathe and to communicate Several special technologies
have been developed to allow lockedin patients to communicate with the rest of the world One
technology for example allows patients to type out sentences by twitching their cheek These sentences
can then be read aloud by a computer
A relatively new line of research for helping paralyzed patients including those with ALS to communicate
and retain a degree of selfsufficiency is called braincomputer interface BCI technology and is illustrated
in Figure 3517 This technology sounds like something out of science fiction it allows paralyzed patients
to control a computer using only their thoughts There are several forms of BCI Some forms use EEG
recordings from electrodes taped onto the skull These recordings contain information from large
populations of neurons that can be decoded by a computer Other forms of BCI require the implantation of
an array of electrodes smaller than a postage stamp in the arm and hand area of the motor cortex This
form of BCI while more invasive is very powerful as each electrode can record actual action potentials from
one or more neurons These signals are then sent to a computer which has been trained to decode the
signal and feed it to a toolsuch as a cursor on a computer screen This means that a patient with ALS can
use email read the Internet and communicate with others by thinking of moving his or her hand or arm
even though the paralyzed patient cannot make that bodily movement Recent advances have allowed a
paralyzed lockedin patient who suffered a stroke 15 years ago to control a robotic arm and even to feed
herself coffee using BCI technology
Despite the amazing advancements in BCI technology it also has limitations The technology can require
many hours of training and long periods of intense concentration for the patient it can also require brain
surgery to implant the devices
Figure 3517 With braincomputer interface technology neural signals from a paralyzed patient are collected
decoded and then fed to a tool such as a computer a wheelchair or a robotic arm
