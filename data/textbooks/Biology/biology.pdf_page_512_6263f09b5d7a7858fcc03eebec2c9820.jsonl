the process in the only illustration in On the Origin of Species Figure 1811a Compare this illustration to the
diagram of elephant evolution Figure 1811 which shows that as one species changes over time it branches
to form more than one new species repeatedly as long as the population survives or until the organism becomes
extinct
Figure 1811 The only illustration in Darwins On the Origin of Species is a a diagram showing speciation events
leading to biological diversity The diagram shows similarities to phylogenetic charts that today illustrate the
relationships of species b Modern elephants evolved from the Palaeomastodon a species that lived in Egypt 3550
million years ago
For speciation to occur two new populations must form from one original population and they must evolve in
such a way that it becomes impossible for individuals from the two new populations to interbreed Biologists
have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories Allopatric speciation
allo  other patric  homeland involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species
and subsequent evolution Sympatric speciation sym  same patric  homeland involves speciation
occurring within a parent species remaining in one location
Biologists think of speciation events as the splitting of one ancestral species into two descendant species There
is no reason why more than two species might not form at one time except that it is less likely and we can
conceptualize multiple events as single splits occurring close in time
Allopatric Speciation
A geographically continuous population has a gene pool that is relatively homogeneous Gene flow the
movement of alleles across a species range is relatively free because individuals can move and then mate with
individuals in their new location Thus an alleles frequency at one end of a distribution will be similar to the
alleles frequency at the other end When populations become geographically discontinuous it prevents alleles
freeflow When that separation lasts for a period of time the two populations are able to evolve along different
trajectories Thus their allele frequencies at numerous genetic loci gradually become increasingly different as
new alleles independently arise by mutation in each population Typically environmental conditions such as
climate resources predators and competitors for the two populations will differ causing natural selection to
favor divergent adaptations in each group
Isolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways a river forming a new
branch erosion creating a new valley a group of organisms traveling to a new location without the ability to
return or seeds floating over the ocean to an island The nature of the geographic separation necessary to
isolate populations depends entirely on the organisms biology and its potential for dispersal If two flying insect
populations took up residence in separate nearby valleys chances are individuals from each population would
fly back and forth continuing gene flow However if a new lake divided two rodent populations continued gene
flow would be unlikely therefore speciation would be more likely
Biologists group allopatric processes into two categories dispersal and vicariance Dispersal is when a few
members of a species move to a new geographical area and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to
physically divide organisms
Scientists have documented numerous cases of allopatric speciation taking place For example along the west
coast of the United States two separate spotted owl subspecies exist The northern spotted owl has genetic and
