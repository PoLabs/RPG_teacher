A single copy of the wildtype allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival The dominant
lethal inheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote this
allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age Individuals with mutations
that result in dominant lethal alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form Dominant lethal alleles are
very rare because as you might expect the allele only lasts one generation and is not transmitted However
just as the recessive lethal allele might not immediately manifest the phenotype of death dominant lethal alleles
also might not be expressed until adulthood Once the individual reaches reproductive age the allele may be
unknowingly passed on resulting in a delayed death in both generations An example of this in humans is
Huntingtons disease in which the nervous system gradually wastes away Figure 1214 People who are
heterozygous for the dominant Huntington allele Hh will inevitably develop the fatal disease However the
onset of Huntingtons disease may not occur until age 40 at which point the afflicted persons may have already
passed the allele to 50 percent of their offspring

disease orange area in the center of the neuron Huntingtons disease occurs when an abnormal dominant allele for

123  Laws of Inheritance
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain Mendels law of segregation and independent assortment in terms of genetics and the events of
meiosis

Use the forkedline method and the probability rules to calculate the probability of genotypes and
phenotypes from multiple gene crosses

Explain the effect of linkage and recombination on gamete genotypes

Explain the phenotypic outcomes of epistatic effects between genes
Mendel generalized the results of his peaplant experiments into four postulates some of which are sometimes
called laws that describe the basis of dominant and recessive inheritance in diploid organisms As you have
learned more complex extensions of Mendelism exist that do not exhibit the same F2 phenotypic ratios 31
