total mass of aboveground living plants per area
deepest part of the ocean at depths of 4000 m or greater
rapid increase of algae in an aquatic system
part of the ocean where no light penetrates
also benthic zone part of the ocean that extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to
the deepest parts of the ocean floor
study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their
distribution
ecological community of plants animals and other organisms that is adapted to a characteristic set of
environmental conditions
living components of the environment
branches and foliage of trees that form a layer of overhead coverage in a forest
width of a river or stream from one bank to the other bank
frozen chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean
longterm predictable atmospheric conditions present in a specific area

ocean ridges formed by marine invertebrates living in warm shallow waters within the photic zone
invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of coral reefs
study of interaction between living things and their environment
human benefits and services provided by natural ecosystems

ecosystem to the top
altered global weather patterns including a worldwide increase in temperature due
largely to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide
warming of Earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
atmospheric gases such as carbon dioxide and methane that absorb and emit radiation
thus trapping heat in Earths atmosphere
