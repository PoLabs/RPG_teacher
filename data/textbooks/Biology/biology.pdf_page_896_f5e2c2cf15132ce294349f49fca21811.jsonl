297  The Evolution of Primates
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the derived features that distinguish primates from other animals

Describe the defining features of the major groups of primates

Identify the major hominin precursors to modern humans

Explain why scientists are having difficulty determining the true lines of descent in hominids
Order Primates of class Mammalia includes lemurs tarsiers monkeys apes and humans Nonhuman primates
live primarily in the tropical or subtropical regions of South America Africa and Asia They range in size from the
mouse lemur at 30 grams 1 ounce to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms 441 pounds The characteristics
and evolution of primates are of particular interest to us as they allow us to understand the evolution of our own
species
Characteristics of Primates
All primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees as they all descended from treedwellers This
arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for climbing or brachiation
swinging through trees using the arms These adaptations include but are not limited to 1 a rotating shoulder
joint 2 a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes except humans and thumbs sufficiently separated
from fingers to allow for gripping branches and 3 stereoscopic vision two overlapping fields of vision from the
eyes which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance Other characteristics of primates are brains
that are larger than those of most other mammals claws that have been modified into flattened nails typically
only one offspring per pregnancy and a trend toward holding the body upright
Order Primates is divided into two groups Strepsirrhini turnednosed and Haplorhini simplenosed
primates Strepsirrhines also called the wetnosed primates include prosimians like the bush babies and pottos
of Africa the lemurs of Madagascar and the lorises of Southeast Asia Haplorhines or drynosed primates
include tarsiers Figure 2942 and simians New World monkeys Old World monkeys apes and humans In
general strepsirrhines tend to be nocturnal have larger olfactory centers in the brain and exhibit a smaller size
and smaller brain than anthropoids Haplorhines with a few exceptions are diurnal and depend more on their
vision Another interesting difference between the strepsirrhines and haplorhines is that strepsirrhines have the
enzymes for making vitamin C while haplorhines have to get it from their food
