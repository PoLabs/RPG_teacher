developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a
homozygote Called the test cross this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders In a test cross
the dominantexpressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same
characteristic If the dominantexpressing organism is a homozygote then all F1 offspring will be heterozygotes
expressing the dominant trait Figure 125 Alternatively if the dominant expressing organism is a heterozygote
the F1 offspring will exhibit a 11 ratio of heterozygotes and recessive homozygotes Figure 125 The test cross
further validates Mendels postulate that pairs of unit factors segregate equally
Figure 125 A test cross can be performed to determine whether an organism expressing a dominant trait is a
homozygote or a heterozygote
In pea plants round peas R are dominant to wrinkled peas r You do a test cross between a pea plant with
wrinkled peas genotype rr and a plant of unknown genotype that has round peas You end up with three
plants all which have round peas From this data can you tell if the round pea parent plant is homozygous
dominant or heterozygous If the round pea parent plant is heterozygous what is the probability that a
random sample of 3 progeny peas will all be round
Many human diseases are genetically inherited A healthy person in a family in which some members suffer
from a recessive genetic disorder may want to know if he or she has the diseasecausing gene and what risk
exists of passing the disorder on to his or her offspring Of course doing a test cross in humans is unethical
and impractical Instead geneticists use pedigree analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic
diseases Figure 126
