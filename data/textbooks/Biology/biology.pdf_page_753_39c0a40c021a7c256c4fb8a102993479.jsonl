which may indicate that the group is not monophyletic Like angiosperms they have broad leaves Ephedra
Figure 2612a occurs in dry areas of the West Coast of the United States and Mexico Ephedras small scale
like leaves are the source of the compound ephedrine which is used in medicine as a potent decongestant
Because ephedrine is similar to amphetamines both in chemical structure and neurological effects its use
is restricted to prescription drugs Gnetum species Figure 2612b are found in some parts of Africa South
America and Southeast Asia and include trees shrubs and vines Welwitschia Figure 2612c is found
in the Namib desert and is possibly the oddest member of the group It produces only two leaves which
grow continuously throughout the life of the plant some plants are hundreds of years old Like the ginkgos
Welwitschia produces male and female gametes on separate plants

263  Angiosperms
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain why angiosperms are the dominant form of plant life in most terrestrial ecosystems

Describe the main parts of a flower and their functions

Detail the life cycle of a typical gymnosperm and angiosperm

Discuss the similarities and differences between the two main groups of flowering plants
From their humble and still obscure beginning during the early Jurassic period the angiospermsor flowering
plantshave evolved to dominate most terrestrial ecosystems Figure 2613 With more than 300000 species
the angiosperm phylum Anthophyta is second only to insects in terms of diversification
