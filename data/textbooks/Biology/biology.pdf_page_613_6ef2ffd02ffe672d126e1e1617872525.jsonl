Reproduction
Reproduction in prokaryotes is asexual and usually takes place by binary fission Recall that the DNA of a
prokaryote is a single circular chromosome Prokaryotes do not undergo mitosis instead the chromosome is
replicated and the two resulting copies separate from one another due to the growth of the cell The prokaryote
now enlarged is pinched inward at its equator and the two resulting cells which are clones separate Binary
fission does not provide an opportunity for genetic recombination or genetic diversity but prokaryotes can share
genes by three other mechanisms
In transformation the prokaryote takes in DNA shed by other prokaryotes into its environment If a
nonpathogenic bacterium takes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into
its own chromosome it too may become pathogenic In transduction bacteriophages the viruses that infect
bacteria may move short pieces of chromosomal DNA from one bacterium to another Transduction results in a
recombinant organism Archaea also have viruses that may translocate genetic material from one individual to
another In conjugation DNA is transferred from one prokaryote to another by means of a pilus which brings
the organisms into contact with one another and provides a channel for transfer of DNA The DNA transferred
can be in the form of a plasmid or as a composite molecule containing both plasmid and chromosomal DNA
These three processes of DNA exchange are shown in Figure 2217
Reproduction can be very rapid a few minutes for some species This short generation time coupled with
mechanisms of genetic recombination and high rates of mutation result in the rapid evolution of prokaryotes
allowing them to respond to environmental changes such as the introduction of an antibiotic very quickly
Figure 2217 Gene transfer mechanisms in prokaryotes There are three mechanisms by which prokaryotes can
exchange DNA In a transformation the cell takes up prokaryotic DNA directly from the environment The DNA
may remain separate as plasmid DNA or be incorporated into the host genome In b transduction a bacteriophage
injects DNA into the cell that contains a small fragment of DNA from a different prokaryote In c conjugation DNA is
transferred from one cell to another via a mating bridge or pilus that connects the two cells after the sex pilus draws
the two bacteria close enough to form the bridge
