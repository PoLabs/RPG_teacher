For example the Arctic Tern Sterna paradisaea makes a 40000 km 24000 mi roundtrip flight each year
between its feeding grounds in the southern hemisphere and its breeding grounds in the Arctic Ocean Monarch
butterflies Danaus plexippus live in the eastern and western United States in the warmer months where they
build up enormous populations and migrate to areas around Michoacan Mexico as well as areas along the
Pacific Coast and the southern United States in the wintertime Some species of mammals also make migratory
forays Reindeer Rangifer tarandus travel about 5000 km 3100 mi each year to find food Amphibians and
reptiles are more limited in their distribution because they generally lack migratory ability Not all animals that
could migrate do so migration carries risk and comes at a highenergy cost
Some animals hibernate or estivate to survive hostile temperatures Hibernation enables animals to survive
cold conditions and estivation allows animals to survive the hostile conditions of a hot dry climate Animals
that hibernate or estivate enter a state known as torpor a condition in which their metabolic rate is significantly
lowered This enables the animal to wait until its environment better supports its survival Some amphibians
such as the wood frog Rana sylvatica have an antifreezelike chemical in their cells which retains the cells
integrity and prevents them from freezing and bursting
Water
Water is required by all living things because it is critical for cellular processes Since terrestrial organisms lose
water to the environment they have evolved many adaptations to retain water

Plants have a number of interesting features on their leaves such as leaf hairs and a waxy cuticle that
serve to decrease the rate of water loss via transpiration and convection

Freshwater organisms are surrounded by water and are constantly in danger of having water rush into their
cells because of osmosis Many adaptations of organisms living in freshwater environments have evolved
to ensure that solute concentrations in their bodies remain within appropriate levels One such adaptation
is the excretion of dilute urine

Marine organisms are surrounded by water with a higher solute concentration than the organism and thus
are in danger of losing water to the environment because of osmosis These organisms have morphological
and physiological adaptations to retain water and release solutes into the environment For example Marine
iguanas Amblyrhynchus cristatus sneeze out water vapor that is high in salt in order to maintain solute
concentrations within an acceptable range while swimming in the ocean and eating marine plants
Inorganic Nutrients and Soil
Inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are important in determining the distribution and the
abundance of living things Plants obtain these inorganic nutrients from the soil when water moves into the plant
through the roots Therefore soil structure particle size of soil components soil pH and soil nutrient content
together all play an important role in the distribution of plants Animals obtain inorganic nutrients from the food
they consume Therefore animal distributions are related to the distribution of what they eat In some cases
animals will follow their food resource as it moves through the environment
Other Aquatic Factors
Some abiotic factors such as oxygen are important in aquatic ecosystems as well as terrestrial environments
Terrestrial animals obtain oxygen from the air they breathe Oxygen availability can be an issue for organisms
living at very high elevations however where there are fewer molecules of oxygen in the air In aquatic systems
the concentration of dissolved oxygen is related to water temperature and the speed at which the water moves
Cold water has more dissolved oxygen than warmer water In addition salinity currents and tidal changes can
be important abiotic factors in aquatic ecosystems
Other Terrestrial Factors
Wind can be an important abiotic factor because it influences the rate of evaporation transpiration and
convective heat loss from the surface of all organisms The physical force of wind is also important because it
can move soil water or other abiotic factors as well as an ecosystems organisms
Fire is another terrestrial factor that can be an important agent of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems Some
organisms are adapted to fire and thus require the high heat associated with fire to complete a part of their life
cycle For example the jack pine Pinus banksiana requires heat from fire for its seed cones to open Figure
4411 Through the burning of pine needles fire adds nitrogen to the soil and limits competition by destroying
undergrowth
