Figure 3510 The a resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations of Na and K ions inside
and outside the cell A nerve impulse causes Na to enter the cell resulting in b depolarization At the peak action
potential K channels open and the cell becomes c hyperpolarized
Action Potential
A neuron can receive input from other neurons and if this input is strong enough send the signal to downstream
neurons Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter
Transmission of a signal within a neuron from dendrite to axon terminal is carried by a brief reversal of the
resting membrane potential called an action potential When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors
