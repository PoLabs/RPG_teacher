growth of axillary buds that form along the sides of branches and stems Most coniferous trees exhibit strong
apical dominance thus producing the typical conical Christmas tree shape If the apical bud is removed then
the axillary buds will start forming lateral branches Gardeners make use of this fact when they prune plants by
cutting off the tops of branches thus encouraging the axillary buds to grow out giving the plant a bushy shape

Secondary Growth
The increase in stem thickness that results from secondary growth is due to the activity of the lateral meristems
which are lacking in herbaceous plants Lateral meristems include the vascular cambium and in woody plants
the cork cambium see Figure 3010 The vascular cambium is located just outside the primary xylem and to the
interior of the primary phloem The cells of the vascular cambium divide and form secondary xylem tracheids
and vessel elements to the inside and secondary phloem sieve elements and companion cells to the outside
The thickening of the stem that occurs in secondary growth is due to the formation of secondary phloem and
secondary xylem by the vascular cambium plus the action of cork cambium which forms the tough outermost
layer of the stem The cells of the secondary xylem contain lignin which provides hardiness and strength
In woody plants cork cambium is the outermost lateral meristem It produces cork cells bark containing a waxy
substance known as suberin that can repel water The bark protects the plant against physical damage and helps
reduce water loss The cork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm which grows inward
from the cambium The cork cambium cork cells and phelloderm are collectively termed the periderm The
periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants In some plants the periderm has many openings known
as lenticels which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the outside atmosphere Figure 3011 This
supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex xylem and phloem
