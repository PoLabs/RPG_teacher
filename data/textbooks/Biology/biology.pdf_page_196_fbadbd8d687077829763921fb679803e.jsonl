and importing two K ions one ATP molecule must hydrolyze When ATP hydrolyzes its gamma phosphate
does not simply float away but it actually transfers onto the pump protein Scientists call this process of a
phosphate group binding to a molecule phosphorylation As with most ATP hydrolysis cases a phosphate from
ATP transfers onto another molecule In a phosphorylated state the NaK pump has more free energy and is
triggered to undergo a conformational change This change allows it to release Na to the cells outside It then
binds extracellular K which through another conformational change causes the phosphate to detach from the
pump This phosphate release triggers the K to release to the cells inside Essentially the energy released
from the ATP hydrolysis couples with the energy required to power the pump and transport Na and K ions
ATP performs cellular work using this basic form of energy coupling through phosphorylation
Figure 614 The sodiumpotassium pump is an example of energy coupling The energy derived from exergonic
ATP hydrolysis pumps sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane
One ATP molecules hydrolysis releases 73 kcalmol of energy G  73 kcalmol of energy If it takes
21 kcalmol of energy to move one Na across the membrane G  21 kcalmol of energy how many
sodium ions could one ATP molecules hydrolysis move
Often during cellular metabolic reactions such as nutrient synthesis and breakdown certain molecules must
alter slightly in their conformation to become substrates for the next step in the reaction series One example
is during the very first steps of cellular respiration when a sugar glucose molecule breaks down in the process
of glycolysis In the first step ATP is required to phosphorylze glucose creating a highenergy but unstable
intermediate This phosphorylation reaction powers a conformational change that allows the phosphorylated
glucose molecule to convert to the phosphorylated sugar fructose Fructose is a necessary intermediate for
glycolysis to move forward Here ATP hydrolysis exergonic reaction couples with the endergonic reaction of
converting glucose into a phosphorylated intermediate in the pathway Once again the energy released by
breaking a phosphate bond within ATP was used for phosphorylyzing another molecule creating an unstable
intermediate and powering an important conformational change
