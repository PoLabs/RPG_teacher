of the body whereas the male genital pore is nearer to the tip In anatomical males specialized structures called
copulatory spicules at the tail of the male keep him in place and open the vulva of the female into which the
amoeboid sperm travel into the spermatheca
Fertilization is internal and embryonic development starts very soon after fertilization The embryo is released
from the vulva during the gastrulation stage The embryonic development stage lasts for 14 hours development
then continues through four successive larval stages with molting and ecdysis taking place between each
stageL1 L2 L3 and L4ultimately leading to the development of a young adult worm Adverse environmental
conditions such as overcrowding or lack of food can result in the formation of an intermediate larval stage known
as the dauer larva An unusual feature of some nematodes is eutely the body of a given species contains a
specific number of cells as the consequence of a rigid developmental pathway
