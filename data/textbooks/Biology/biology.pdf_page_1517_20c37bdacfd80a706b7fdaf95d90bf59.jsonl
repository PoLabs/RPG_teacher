For the most part fishery extinction is not equivalent to biological extinctionthe last fish of a species is rarely
fished out of the ocean At the same time fishery extinction is still harmful to fish species and their ecosystems
There are some instances in which true extinction is a possibility Whales have slowgrowing populations due
to low reproductive rates and therefore are at risk of complete extinction through hunting There are some
species of sharks with restricted distributions that are at risk of extinction The groupers are another population
of generally slowgrowing fishes that in the Caribbean includes a number of species that are at risk of extinction
from overfishing
Coral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems that face immediate peril from several processes Reefs
are home to 13 of the worlds marine fish speciesabout 4000 speciesdespite making up only 1 percent
of marine habitat Most home marine aquaria are stocked with wildcaught organisms not cultured organisms
Although no species is known to have been driven extinct by the pet trade in marine species there are studies
showing that populations of some species have declined in response to harvesting indicating that the harvest is
not sustainable at those levels There are concerns about the effect of the pet trade on some terrestrial species
such as turtles amphibians birds plants and even the orangutan

Bush meat is the generic term used for wild animals killed for food Hunting is practiced throughout the world
but hunting practices particularly in equatorial Africa and parts of Asia are believed to threaten a number of
species with extinction Traditionally bush meat in Africa was hunted to feed families directly however recent
commercialization of the practice now has bush meat available in grocery stores which has increased harvest
rates to the level of unsustainability Additionally human population growth has increased the need for protein
foods that are not being met from agriculture Species threatened by the bush meat trade are mostly mammals
including many primates living in the Congo basin
Exotic Species
Exotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced into an ecosystem in which
they did not evolve For example Kudzu Pueraria lobata which is native to Japan was introduced in the United
States in 1876 It was later planted for soil conservation Problematically it grows too well in the southeastern
United Statesup to a foot a day It is now an invasive pest species and covers over 7 million acres in the
southeastern United States If an introduced species is able to survive in its new habitat that introduction is
now reflected in the observed range of the species Human transportation of people and goods including the
intentional transport of organisms for trade has dramatically increased the introduction of species into new
ecosystems sometimes at distances that are well beyond the capacity of the species to ever travel itself and
outside the range of the species natural predators
Most exotic species introductions probably fail because of the low number of individuals introduced or poor
adaptation to the ecosystem they enter Some species however possess preadaptations that can make them
especially successful in a new ecosystem These exotic species often undergo dramatic population increases
in their new habitat and reset the ecological conditions in the new environment threatening the species that
exist there For this reason exotic species are also called invasive species Exotic species can threaten other
species through competition for resources predation or disease For example the Eurasian star thistle also
called spotted knapweed has invaded and rendered useless some of the open prairies of the western states
However it is a great nectarbearing flower for the production of honey and supports numerous pollinating
insects including migrating monarch butterflies in the northcentral states such as Michigan
