at all four loci We can answer this question using phenotypic proportions but lets do it the hard wayusing
genotypic proportions The question asks for the proportion of offspring that are 1 homozygous dominant at A
or heterozygous at A and 2 homozygous at B or heterozygous at B and so on Noting the or and and in
each circumstance makes clear where to apply the sum and product rules The probability of a homozygous
dominant at A is 14 and the probability of a heterozygote at A is 12 The probability of the homozygote or the
heterozygote is 14  12  34 using the sum rule The same probability can be obtained in the same way for
each of the other genes so that the probability of a dominant phenotype at A and B and C and D is using the
product rule equal to 34  34  34  34 or 2764 If you are ever unsure about how to combine probabilities
returning to the forkedline method should make it clear
Rules for Multihybrid Fertilization
Predicting the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from given crosses is the best way to test your knowledge
of Mendelian genetics Given a multihybrid cross that obeys independent assortment and follows a dominant
and recessive pattern several generalized rules exist you can use these rules to check your results as you
work through genetics calculations Table 125 To apply these rules first you must determine n the number
of heterozygous gene pairs the number of genes segregating two alleles each For example a cross between
AaBb and AaBb heterozygotes has an n of 2 In contrast a cross between AABb and AABb has an n of 1
because A is not heterozygous

Linked Genes Violate the Law of Independent Assortment
Although all of Mendels pea characteristics behaved according to the law of independent assortment we now
know that some allele combinations are not inherited independently of each other Genes that are located on
separate nonhomologous chromosomes will always sort independently However each chromosome contains
hundreds or thousands of genes organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string The segregation
of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage in which genes that are located physically close to each
other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair However because of the process of
recombination or crossover it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently or
as if they are not linked To understand this lets consider the biological basis of gene linkage and recombination
Homologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same linear order The alleles may differ on
homologous chromosome pairs but the genes to which they correspond do not In preparation for the first
division of meiosis homologous chromosomes replicate and synapse Like genes on the homologs align with
each other At this stage segments of homologous chromosomes exchange linear segments of genetic material
Figure 1218 This process is called recombination or crossover and it is a common genetic process Because
the genes are aligned during recombination the gene order is not altered Instead the result of recombination
is that maternal and paternal alleles are combined onto the same chromosome Across a given chromosome
several recombination events may occur causing extensive shuffling of alleles
