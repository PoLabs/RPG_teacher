We associate potential energy only with the matters location such as a child sitting on a tree branch but also
with the matters structure A spring on the ground has potential energy if it is compressed so does a tautly
pulled rubber band The very existence of living cells relies heavily on structural potential energy On a chemical
level the bonds that hold the molecules atoms together have potential energy Remember that anabolic cellular
pathways require energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones and catabolic pathways release
energy when complex molecules break down That certain chemical bonds breakdown can release energy
implies that those bonds have potential energy In fact there is potential energy stored within the bonds of all the
food molecules we eat which we eventually harness for use This is because these bonds can release energy
when broken Scientists call the potential energy type that exists within chemical bonds that releases when those
bonds break chemical energy Figure 67 Chemical energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy
from food Breaking the molecular bonds within fuel molecules brings about the energys release
Figure 67 The molecules in gasoline contain chemical energy within the chemical bonds This energy transforms into
kinetic energy that allows a car to race on a racetrack credit car modification of work by Russell Trow
