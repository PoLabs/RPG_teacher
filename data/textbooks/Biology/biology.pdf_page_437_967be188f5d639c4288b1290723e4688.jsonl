of vertebrate genes 5gccRccAUGG3 The R for purine indicates a site that can be either A or G but cannot
be C or U Essentially the closer the sequence is to this consensus the higher the efficiency of translation
Once the appropriate AUG is identified the other proteins and CBP dissociate and the 60S subunit binds
to the complex of MettRNAi mRNA and the 40S subunit This step completes the initiation of translation in
eukaryotes
Translation Elongation and Termination
In prokaryotes and eukaryotes the basics of elongation are the same so we will review elongation from the
perspective of E coli When the translation complex is formed the tRNA binding region of the ribosome consists
of three compartments The A aminoacyl site binds incoming charged aminoacyl tRNAs The P peptidyl site
binds charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds with the growing polypeptide chain
but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA The E exit site releases dissociated tRNAs so that
they can be recharged with free amino acids The initiating methionyltRNA however occupies the P site at the
beginning of the elongation phase of translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
During translation elongation the mRNA template provides tRNA binding specificity As the ribosome moves
along the mRNA each mRNA codon comes into register and specific binding with the corresponding charged
tRNA anticodon is ensured If mRNA were not present in the elongation complex the ribosome would bind
tRNAs nonspecifically and randomly 
Elongation proceeds with charged tRNAs sequentially entering and leaving the ribosome as each new amino
acid is added to the polypeptide chain Movement of a tRNA from A to P to E site is induced by conformational
changes that advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3 direction The energy for each step along the
ribosome is donated by elongation factors that hydrolyze GTP GTP energy is required both for the binding of
a new aminoacyltRNA to the A site and for its translocation to the P site after formation of the peptide bond
Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the Asite tRNA and the carboxyl
group of the amino acid attached to the Psite tRNA The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl
transferase an RNAbased enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit The energy for each
peptide bond formation is derived from the highenergy bond linking each amino acid to its tRNA After peptide
bond formation the Asite tRNA that now holds the growing peptide chain moves to the P site and the Psite
tRNA that is now empty moves to the E site and is expelled from the ribosome Figure 1516 Amazingly the
E coli translation apparatus takes only 005 seconds to add each amino acid meaning that a 200aminoacid
protein can be translated in just 10 seconds
