Figure 239 Eukaryotic supergroups This diagram shows a proposed classification of the domain Eukarya Currently
the domain Eukarya is divided into six supergroups Within each supergroup are multiple kingdoms Although each
supergroup is believed to be monophyletic the dotted lines suggest evolutionary relationships among the supergroups
that continue to be debated
Keep in mind that the classification scheme presented here represents just one of several hypotheses and the
true evolutionary relationships are still to be determined The six supergroups may be modified or replaced by
a more appropriate hierarchy as genetic morphological and ecological data accumulate When learning about
protists it is helpful to focus less on the nomenclature and more on the commonalities and differences that
illustrate how each group has exploited the possibilities of eukaryotic life
