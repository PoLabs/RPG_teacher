Like the rest of the plant the stem has three tissue systems dermal vascular and ground tissue Each is
distinguished by characteristic cell types that perform specific tasks necessary for the plants growth and survival
Dermal Tissue
The dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis a single layer of cells covering and protecting the
underlying tissue Woody plants have a tough waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark
which further protects the plant from damage Epidermal cells are the most numerous and least differentiated
of the cells in the epidermis The epidermis of a leaf also contains openings known as stomata through which
the exchange of gases takes place Figure 308 Two cells known as guard cells surround each leaf stoma
controlling its opening and closing and thus regulating the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen
and water vapor Trichomes are hairlike structures on the epidermal surface They help to reduce transpiration
