Figure 3837 The crossbridge muscle contraction cycle which is triggered by Ca2 binding to the actin active
site is shown With each contraction cycle actin moves relative to myosin
Which of the following statements about muscle contraction is true
a
The power stroke occurs when ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and phosphate
b
The power stroke occurs when ADP and phosphate dissociate from the myosin head
c
The power stroke occurs when ADP and phosphate dissociate from the actin active site
d
The power stroke occurs when Ca2 binds the calcium head

Regulatory Proteins
When a muscle is in a resting state actin and myosin are separated To keep actin from binding to the active
