Question Would a kiwi and strawberry that are approximately the same size Figure 156 also have
approximately the same amount of DNA
Background Genes are carried on chromosomes and are made of DNA All mammals are diploid meaning
they have two copies of each chromosome However not all plants are diploid The common strawberry
is octoploid 8n and the cultivated kiwi is hexaploid 6n Research the total number of chromosomes in
the cells of each of these fruits and think about how this might correspond to the amount of DNA in these
fruits cell nuclei What other factors might contribute to the total amount of DNA in a single fruit Read
about the technique of DNA isolation to understand how each step in the isolation protocol helps liberate
and precipitate DNA
Hypothesis Hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference in DNA quantity from similarly
sized strawberries and kiwis Which fruit do you think would yield more DNA
Test your hypothesis Isolate the DNA from a strawberry and a kiwi that are similarly sized Perform the
experiment in at least triplicate for each fruit
1
Prepare a bottle of DNA extraction buffer from 900 mL water 50 mL dish detergent and two teaspoons
of table salt Mix by inversion cap it and turn it upside down a few times
2
Grind a strawberry and a kiwi by hand in a plastic bag or using a mortar and pestle or with a metal
bowl and the end of a blunt instrument Grind for at least two minutes per fruit
3
Add 10 mL of the DNA extraction buffer to each fruit and mix well for at least one minute
4
Remove cellular debris by filtering each fruit mixture through cheesecloth or porous cloth and into a
funnel placed in a test tube or an appropriate container
5
Pour icecold ethanol or isopropanol rubbing alcohol into the test tube You should observe white
precipitated DNA
6
Gather the DNA from each fruit by winding it around separate glass rods
Record your observations Because you are not quantitatively measuring DNA volume you can record for
each trial whether the two fruits produced the same or different amounts of DNA as observed by eye If one
or the other fruit produced noticeably more DNA record this as well Determine whether your observations
are consistent with several pieces of each fruit
Analyze your data Did you notice an obvious difference in the amount of DNA produced by each fruit
Were your results reproducible
Draw a conclusion Given what you know about the number of chromosomes in each fruit can you
conclude that chromosome number necessarily correlates to DNA amount Can you identify any drawbacks
to this procedure If you had access to a laboratory how could you standardize your comparison and make
