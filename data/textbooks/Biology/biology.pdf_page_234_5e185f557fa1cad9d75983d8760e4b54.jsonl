the cell to support endergonic chemical reactions The structure of ATP is that of an RNA nucleotide with three
phosphates attached As ATP is used for energy a phosphate group or two are detached and either ADP or
AMP is produced Energy derived from glucose catabolism is used to convert ADP into ATP When ATP is used
in a reaction the third phosphate is temporarily attached to a substrate in a process called phosphorylation
The two processes of ATP regeneration that are used in conjunction with glucose catabolism are substrate
level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation through the process of chemiosmosis
72 Glycolysis
Glycolysis is the first pathway within the cytoplasm used in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy It was
probably one of the earliest metabolic pathways to evolve and is used by nearly all of the organisms on Earth
Glycolysis consists of two parts The first part prepares the sixcarbon ring of glucose for cleavage into two
threecarbon sugars ATP is invested in the process during this half to energize the separation The second half
of glycolysis extracts ATP and highenergy electrons from hydrogen atoms and attaches them to NAD Two
ATP molecules are invested in the first half and four ATP molecules are formed by substrate phosphorylation
during the second half This produces a net gain of two ATP and two NADH molecules for the cell
73 Oxidation of Pyruvate and the Citric Acid Cycle
In the presence of oxygen pyruvate is transformed into an acetyl group attached to a carrier molecule of
coenzyme A The resulting acetyl CoA can enter several pathways but most often the acetyl group is
delivered to the citric acid cycle for further catabolism During the conversion of pyruvate into the acetyl group
a molecule of carbon dioxide and two highenergy electrons are removed The carbon dioxide accounts for two
conversion of two pyruvate molecules of the six carbons of the original glucose molecule The electrons are
picked up by NAD and the NADH carries the electrons to a later pathway for ATP production At this point the
glucose molecule that originally entered cellular respiration has been completely oxidized Chemical potential
energy stored within the glucose molecule has been transferred to electron carriers or has been used to
synthesize a few ATPs
The citric acid cycle is a series of redox and decarboxylation reactions that removes highenergy electrons and
carbon dioxide The electrons temporarily stored in molecules of NADH and FADH2 are used to generate ATP
in a subsequent pathway One molecule of either GTP or ATP is produced by substratelevel phosphorylation
on each turn of the cycle There is no comparison of the cyclic pathway with a linear one
74 Oxidative Phosphorylation
The electron transport chain is the portion of aerobic respiration that uses free oxygen as the final electron
acceptor of the electrons removed from the intermediate compounds in glucose catabolism The electron
transport chain is composed of four large multiprotein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial
membrane and two small diffusible electron carriers shuttling electrons between them The electrons are
passed through a series of redox reactions with a small amount of free energy used at three points to transport
hydrogen ions across a membrane This process contributes to the gradient used in chemiosmosis The
electrons passing through the electron transport chain gradually lose energy Highenergy electrons donated to
the chain by either NADH or FADH2 complete the chain as lowenergy electrons reduce oxygen molecules and
form water The level of free energy of the electrons drops from about 60 kcalmol in NADH or 45 kcalmol in
FADH2 to about 0 kcalmol in water The end products of the electron transport chain are water and ATP A
number of intermediate compounds of the citric acid cycle can be diverted into the anabolism of other
biochemical molecules such as nonessential amino acids sugars and lipids These same molecules can
serve as energy sources for the glucose pathways
75 Metabolism without Oxygen
If NADH cannot be oxidized through aerobic respiration another electron acceptor is used Most organisms will
use some form of fermentation to accomplish the regeneration of NAD ensuring the continuation of glycolysis
The regeneration of NAD in fermentation is not accompanied by ATP production therefore the potential of
NADH to produce ATP using an electron transport chain is not utilized
