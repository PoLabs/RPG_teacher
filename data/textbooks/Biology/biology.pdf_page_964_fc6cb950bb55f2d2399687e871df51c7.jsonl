opening and closing As the openings for gas exchange stomata help maintain a healthy water balance a
potassium ion pump supports this process
Magnesium Mg and calcium Ca are also important macronutrients The role of calcium is twofold to regulate
nutrient transport and to support many enzyme functions Magnesium is important to the photosynthetic
process These minerals along with the micronutrients which are described below also contribute to the plants
ionic balance
In addition to macronutrients organisms require various elements in small amounts These micronutrients or
trace elements are present in very small quantities They include boron B chlorine Cl manganese Mn iron
Fe zinc Zn copper Cu molybdenum Mo nickel Ni silicon Si and sodium Na
Deficiencies in any of these nutrientsparticularly the macronutrientscan adversely affect plant growth
Figure 314 Depending on the specific nutrient a lack can cause stunted growth slow growth or chlorosis
yellowing of the leaves Extreme deficiencies may result in leaves showing signs of cell death
Visit this website httpopenstaxcollegeorglplant_mineral to participate in an interactive experiment on
plant nutrient deficiencies You can adjust the amounts of N P K Ca Mg and Fe that plants receive    and
see what happens
Figure 314 Nutrient deficiency is evident in the symptoms these plants show This a grape tomato suffers from
blossom end rot caused by calcium deficiency The yellowing in this b Frangula alnus results from magnesium
