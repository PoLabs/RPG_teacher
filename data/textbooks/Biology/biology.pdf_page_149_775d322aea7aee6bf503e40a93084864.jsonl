46 Connections between Cells and Cellular Activities
Animal cells communicate via their extracellular matrices and are connected to each other via tight junctions
desmosomes and gap junctions Plant cells are connected and communicate with each other via
plasmodesmata
When protein receptors on the plasma membranes surface of an animal cell bind to a substance in the
extracellular matrix a chain of reactions begins that changes activities taking place within the cell
Plasmodesmata are channels between adjacent plant cells while gap junctions are channels between adjacent
animal cells However their structures are quite different A tight junction is a watertight seal between two
adjacent cells while a desmosome acts like a spot weld
