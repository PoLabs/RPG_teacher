plasma cell
regulatory T Treg cell
T cell
molecule on macrophages and dendritic cells that binds molecular
signatures of pathogens and promotes pathogen engulfment and destruction
destructive protein that creates a pore in the target cell used by NK cells and killer T cells
immune cell that secrets antibodies these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens
specialized lymphocyte that suppresses local inflammation and inhibits the secretion of
cytokines antibodies and other stimulatory immune factors involved in immune
tolerance
lymphocyte that matures in the thymus gland one of the main cells involved in the adaptive immune
system
CHAPTER SUMMARY
421 Innate Immune Response
The innate immune system serves as a first responder to pathogenic threats that bypass natural physical and
chemical barriers of the body Using a combination of cellular and molecular attacks the innate immune system
identifies the nature of a pathogen and responds with inflammation phagocytosis cytokine release destruction
by NK cells andor a complement system When innate mechanisms are insufficient to clear an infection the
adaptive immune response is informed and mobilized
422 Adaptive Immune Response
The adaptive immune response is a sloweracting longerlasting and more specific response than the innate
response However the adaptive response requires information from the innate immune system to function
APCs display antigens via MHC molecules to complementary nave T cells In response the T cells
differentiate and proliferate becoming TH cells or CTLs TH cells stimulate B cells that have engulfed and
presented pathogenderived antigens B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies whereas
CTLs induce apoptosis in intracellularly infected or cancerous cells Memory cells persist after a primary
exposure to a pathogen If reexposure occurs memory cells differentiate into effector cells without input from
the innate immune system The mucosal immune system is largely independent from the systemic immune
system but functions in a parallel fashion to protect the extensive mucosal surfaces of the body
423 Antibodies
Antibodies immunoglobulins are the molecules secreted from plasma cells that mediate the humoral immune
response There are five antibody classes an antibodys class determines its mechanism of action and
production site but does not control its binding specificity Antibodies bind antigens via variable domains and
can either neutralize pathogens or mark them for phagocytosis or activate the complement cascade
424 Disruptions in the Immune System
Immune disruptions may involve insufficient immune responses or inappropriate immune targets
Immunodeficiency increases an individuals susceptibility to infections and cancers Hypersensitivities are
misdirected responses either to harmless foreign particles as in the case of allergies or to host factors as in
the case of autoimmunity Reactions to self components may be the result of molecular mimicry
