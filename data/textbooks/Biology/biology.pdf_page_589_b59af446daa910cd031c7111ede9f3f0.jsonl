Applied Virology
The study of viruses has led to the development of a variety of new ways to treat nonviral diseases
Viruses have been used in gene therapy Gene therapy is used to treat genetic diseases such as severe
combined immunodeficiency SCID a heritable recessive disease in which children are born with severely
compromised immune systems One common type of SCID is due to the lack of an enzyme adenosine
deaminase ADA which breaks down purine bases To treat this disease by gene therapy bone marrow
cells are taken from a SCID patient and the ADA gene is inserted This is where viruses come in and
their use relies on their ability to penetrate living cells and bring genes in with them Viruses such as
adenovirus an upperrespiratory human virus are modified by the addition of the ADA gene and the virus
then transports this gene into the cell The modified cells now capable of making ADA are then given
back to the patients in the hope of curing them Gene therapy using viruses as carriers of genes viral
vectors although still experimental holds promise for the treatment of many genetic diseases Still many
technological problems need to be solved for this approach to be a viable method for treating genetic
disease
Another medical use for viruses relies on their specificity and ability to kill the cells they infect Oncolytic
viruses are engineered in the laboratory specifically to attack and kill cancer cells A genetically modified
adenovirus known as H101 has been used since 2005 in clinical trials in China to treat head and neck
cancers The results have been promising with a greater shortterm response rate to the combination of
chemotherapy and viral therapy than to chemotherapy treatment alone This ongoing research may herald
the beginning of a new age of cancer therapy where viruses are engineered to find and specifically kill
cancer cells regardless of where in the body they may have spread
A third use of viruses in medicine relies on their specificity and involves using bacteriophages in the
treatment of bacterial infections Bacterial diseases have been treated with antibiotics since the 1940s
However over time many bacteria have evolved resistance to antibiotics A good example is methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA pronounced mersa an infection commonly acquired in
hospitals This bacterium is resistant to a variety of antibiotics making it difficult to treat The use of
bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and specifically kill
them Although phage therapy is in use in the Republic of Georgia to treat antibioticresistant bacteria
its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries However the safety of the
treatment was confirmed in the United States when the US Food and Drug Administration approved
spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy the food pathogen Listeria As more and more antibiotic
resistant strains of bacteria evolve the use of bacteriophages might be a potential solution to the problem
and the development of phage therapy is of much interest to researchers worldwide
214  Other Acellular Entities Prions and Viroids
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe prions and their basic properties

Define viroids and their targets of infection
Prions and viroids are pathogens agents with the ability to cause disease that have simpler structures than
viruses but in the case of prions still can produce deadly diseases
Prions
Prions socalled because they are proteinaceous are infectious particlessmaller than virusesthat contain
no nucleic acids neither DNA nor RNA Historically the idea of an infectious agent that did not use nucleic
acids was considered impossible but pioneering work by Nobel Prizewinning biologist Stanley Prusiner has
convinced the majority of biologists that such agents do indeed exist
