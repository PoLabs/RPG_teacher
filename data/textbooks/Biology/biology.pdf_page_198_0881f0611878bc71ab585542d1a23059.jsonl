outside of an optimal range can affect chemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are less
well suited to bind substrates High temperatures will eventually cause enzymes like other biological molecules
to denature a process that changes the substances natural properties Likewise the local environments pH
can also affect enzyme function Active site amino acid residues have their own acidic or basic properties that
are optimal for catalysis These residues are sensitive to changes in pH that can impair the way substrate
molecules bind Enzymes are suited to function best within a certain pH range and as with temperature
extreme environmental pH values acidic or basic can cause enzymes to denature
Induced Fit and Enzyme Function
For many years scientists thought that enzymesubstrate binding took place in a simple lockandkey fashion
This model asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step However
current research supports a more refined view scientists call induced fit Figure 616 This model expands
upon the lockandkey model by describing a more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate As
the enzyme and substrate come together their interaction causes a mild shift in the enzymes structure that
confirms an ideal binding arrangement between the enzyme and the substrates transition state This ideal
binding maximizes the enzymes ability to catalyze its reaction

When an enzyme binds its substrate it forms an enzymesubstrate complex This complex lowers the reactions
activation energy and promotes its rapid progression in one of many ways On a basic level enzymes promote
chemical reactions that involve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an optimal
orientation The appropriate region atoms and bonds of one molecule is juxtaposed to the other molecules
appropriate region with which it must react Another way in which enzymes promote substrate reaction is by
creating an optimal environment within the active site for the reaction to occur Certain chemical reactions
might proceed best in a slightly acidic or nonpolar environment The chemical properties that emerge from
the particular arrangement of amino acid residues within an active site create the perfect environment for an
enzymes specific substrates to react
You have learned that the activation energy required for many reactions includes the energy involved in
manipulating or slightly contorting chemical bonds so that they can easily break and allow others to reform
Enzymatic action can aid this process The enzymesubstrate complex can lower the activation energy by
contorting substrate molecules in such a way as to facilitate bondbreaking helping to reach the transition state
Finally enzymes can also lower activation energies by taking part in the chemical reaction itself The amino acid
residues can provide certain ions or chemical groups that actually form covalent bonds with substrate molecules
as a necessary step of the reaction process In these cases it is important to remember that the enzyme will
always return to its original state at the reactions completion One of enzymes hallmark properties is that they
remain ultimately unchanged by the reactions they catalyze After an enzyme catalyzes a reaction it releases its
products
