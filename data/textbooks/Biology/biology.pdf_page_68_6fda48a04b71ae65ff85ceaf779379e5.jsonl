Figure 223 Carbon can form five and sixmembered rings Single or double bonds may connect the carbons in the
ring and nitrogen may be substituted for carbon
Isomers
The threedimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to
understanding their chemistry We call molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the
placement structure of their atoms andor chemical bonds isomers Structural isomers like butane and
isobutene in Figure 224a differ in the placement of their covalent bonds both molecules have four carbons
and ten hydrogens C4H10 but the different atom arrangement within the molecules leads to differences in their
chemical properties For example butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches whereas
isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans
Geometric isomers alternatively have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds
are made to the surrounding atoms especially in carbontocarbon double bonds In the simple molecule butene
C4H8 the two methyl groups CH3 can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the molecule
as Figure 224b illustrates When the carbons are bound on the same side of the double bond this is the
cis configuration If they are on opposite sides of the double bond it is a trans configuration In the trans
configuration the carbons form a more or less linear structure whereas the carbons in the cis configuration
make a bend change in direction of the carbon backbone
