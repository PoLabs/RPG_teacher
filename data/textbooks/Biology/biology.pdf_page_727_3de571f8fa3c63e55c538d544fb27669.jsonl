Vascular Tissue Xylem and Phloem
The first plant fossils that show the presence of vascular tissue date to the Silurian period about 430 million
years ago The simplest arrangement of conductive cells shows a pattern of xylem at the center surrounded
by phloem Xylem is the tissue responsible for the storage and longdistance transport of water and nutrients
as well as the transfer of watersoluble growth factors from the organs of synthesis to the target organs The
tissue consists of conducting cells known as tracheids and supportive filler tissue called parenchyma Xylem
conductive cells incorporate the compound lignin into their walls and are thus described as lignified Lignin itself
is a complex polymer It is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength on vascular tissue With their
rigid cell walls the xylem cells provide support to the plant and allow it to achieve impressive heights Tall plants
have a selective advantage by being able to reach unfiltered sunlight and disperse their spores or seeds away
from the parent plant thus expanding the species range By growing higher than other plants tall trees cast
their shadows on shorter plants and thereby outcompete them for water and precious nutrients in the soil
Phloem is the second type of vascular tissue it transports sugars proteins and other solutes throughout the
plant Phloem cells are divided into sieve elements conducting cells and cells that support the sieve elements
Together xylem and phloem tissues form the vascular system of plants Figure 2516

Roots Support for the Plant
Roots are not wellpreserved in the fossil record Nevertheless it seems that roots appeared later in evolution
than vascular tissue The development of an extensive network of roots represented a significant new feature
of vascular plants Thin rhizoids attached bryophytes to the substrate but these rather flimsy filaments did not
provide a strong anchor for the plant nor did they absorb substantial amounts of water and nutrients In contrast
roots with their prominent vascular tissue system transfer water and minerals from the soil to the rest of the
plant The extensive network of roots that penetrates deep into the soil to reach sources of water also stabilizes
plants by acting as a ballast or anchor The majority of roots establish a symbiotic relationship with fungi forming
mutualistic mycorrhizae which benefit the plant by greatly increasing the surface area for absorption of water
soil minerals and nutrients
Leaves Sporophylls and Strobili
A third innovation marks the seedless vascular plants Accompanying the prominence of the sporophyte and the
development of vascular tissue the appearance of true leaves improved their photosynthetic efficiency Leaves
