Figure 221 Methane has a tetrahedral geometry with each of the four hydrogen atoms spaced 1095 apart
As the backbone of the large molecules of living things hydrocarbons may exist as linear carbon chains carbon
rings or combinations of both Furthermore individual carbontocarbon bonds may be single double or triple
covalent bonds and each type of bond affects the molecules geometry in a specific way This threedimensional
shape or conformation of the large molecules of life macromolecules is critical to how they function
Hydrocarbon Chains
Successive bonds between carbon atoms form hydrocarbon chains These may be branched or unbranched
Furthermore a molecules different geometries of single double and triple covalent bonds alter the overall
molecules geometry as Figure 222 illustrates The hydrocarbons ethane ethene and ethyne serve as
examples of how different carbontocarbon bonds affect the molecules geometry The names of all three
molecules start with the prefix eth which is the prefix for two carbon hydrocarbons The suffixes ane ene
and yne refer to the presence of single double or triple carboncarbon bonds respectively Thus propane
propene and propyne follow the same pattern with three carbon molecules butane butene and butyne for
four carbon molecules and so on Double and triple bonds change the molecules geometry single bonds allow
rotation along the bonds axis whereas double bonds lead to a planar configuration and triple bonds to a linear
one These geometries have a significant impact on the shape a particular molecule can assume
Figure 222 When carbon forms single bonds with other atoms the shape is tetrahedral When two carbon atoms form
a double bond the shape is planar or flat Single bonds like those in ethane are able to rotate Double bonds like
those in ethene cannot rotate so the atoms on either side are locked in place
Hydrocarbon Rings
So far the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons which consist of linear chains
of carbon atoms Another type of hydrocarbon aromatic hydrocarbons consists of closed rings of carbon
atoms We find ring structures in hydrocarbons sometimes with the presence of double bonds which we
can see by comparing cyclohexanes structure to benzene in Figure 223 Examples of biological molecules
that incorporate the benzene ring include some amino acids and cholesterol and its derivatives including the
hormones estrogen and testosterone We also find the benzene ring in the herbicide 24D Benzene is a natural
component of crude oil and has been classified as a carcinogen Some hydrocarbons have both aliphatic and
aromatic portions Betacarotene is an example of such a hydrocarbon
