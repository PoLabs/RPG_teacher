Excretion of Nitrogenous Waste
The theory of evolution proposes that life started in an aquatic environment It is not surprising to see
that biochemical pathways like the urea cycle evolved to adapt to a changing environment when terrestrial
life forms evolved Arid conditions probably led to the evolution of the uric acid pathway as a means of
conserving water
Nitrogenous Waste in Birds and Reptiles Uric Acid
Birds reptiles and most terrestrial arthropods convert toxic ammonia to uric acid or the closely related
compound guanine guano instead of urea Mammals also form some uric acid during breakdown of nucleic
acids Uric acid is a compound similar to purines found in nucleic acids It is water insoluble and tends to form a
white paste or powder it is excreted by birds insects and reptiles Conversion of ammonia to uric acid requires
more energy and is much more complex than conversion of ammonia to urea Figure 4113
