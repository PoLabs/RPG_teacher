plan provides a closeup look at annelid anatomy
Classification of Phylum Annelida
Phylum Annelida contains the class Polychaeta the polychaetes and the class Oligochaeta the earthworms
leeches and their relatives The earthworms and the leeches form a monophyletic clade within the polychaetes
which are therefore paraphyletic as a group
There are more than 22000 different species of annelids and more than half of these are marine polychaetes
many bristles In the polychaetes bristles are arranged in clusters on their parapodiafleshy flat paired
appendages that protrude from each segment Many polychaetes use their parapodia to crawl along the sea
floor but others are adapted for swimming or floating Some are sessile living in tubes Some polychaetes live
near hydrothermal vents These deepwater tubeworms have no digestive tract but have a symbiotic relationship
with bacteria living in their bodies
Earthworms are the most abundant members of the class Oligochaeta few bristles distinguished by the
presence of a permanent clitellum as well as the small number of reduced chaetae on each segment Recall
that oligochaetes do not have parapodia The oligochaete subclass Hirudinea includes leeches such as
the medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis which is effective at increasing blood circulation and breaking up
blood clots and thus can be used to treat some circulatory disorders and cardiovascular diseases Their use
goes back thousands of years These animals produce a seasonal clitellum unlike the permanent clitellum
of other oligochaetes A significant difference between leeches and other annelids is the lack of setae and
the development of suckers at the anterior and posterior ends which are used to attach to the host animal
Additionally in leeches the segmentation of the body wall may not correspond to the internal segmentation of
the coelomic cavity This adaptation possibly helps the leeches to elongate when they ingest copious quantities
of blood from host vertebrates a condition in which they are said to be engorged The subclass Brachiobdella
includes tiny leechlike worms that attach themselves to the gills or body surface of crayfish
