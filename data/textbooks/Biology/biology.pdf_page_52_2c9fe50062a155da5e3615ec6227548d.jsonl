Figure 27 Bohr diagrams indicate how many electrons fill each principal shell Group 18 elements helium neon
and argon have a full outer or valence shell A full valence shell is the most stable electron configuration
Elements in other groups have partially filled valence shells and gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable electron
configuration
An atom may give take or share electrons with another atom to achieve a full valence shell the most stable
electron configuration Looking at this figure how many electrons do elements in group 1 need to lose in
order to achieve a stable electron configuration How many electrons do elements in groups 14 and 17
need to gain to achieve a stable configuration
Understanding that the periodic tables organization is based on the total number of protons and electrons
helps us know how electrons distribute themselves among the shells The periodic table is arranged in columns
and rows based on the number of electrons and their location Examine more closely some of the elements in
the tables far right column in Figure 25 The group 18 atoms helium He neon Ne and argon Ar all have
filled outer electron shells making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability
They are highly stable as single atoms Because they are non reactive scientists coin them inert or noble
gases Compare this to the group 1 elements in the lefthand column These elements including hydrogen
H lithium Li and sodium Na all have one electron in their outermost shells That means that they can
achieve a stable configuration and a filled outer shell by donating or sharing one electron with another atom or
a molecule such as water Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration while lithium
and sodium will donate their electron to become stable As a result of losing a negatively charged electron they
become positively charged ions Group 17 elements including fluorine and chlorine have seven electrons in
their outmost shells so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules making them
negatively charged ions Group 14 elements of which carbon is the most important to living systems have four
electrons in their outer shell allowing them to make several covalent bonds discussed below with other atoms
Thus the periodic tables columns represent the potential shared state of these elements outer electron shells
that is responsible for their similar chemical characteristics
Electron Orbitals
Although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements the Bohr model does not
accurately reflect how electrons spatially distribute themselves around the nucleus They do not circle the
nucleus like the earth orbits the sun but we find them in electron orbitals These relatively complex shapes
result from the fact that electrons behave not just like particles but also like waves Mathematical equations from
