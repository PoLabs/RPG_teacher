large common opening called the osculum However we should note that sponges exhibit a range of diversity in
body forms including variations in the size and shape of the spongocoel as well as the number and arrangement
of feeding chambers within the body wall In some sponges multiple feeding chambers open off of a central
spongocoel and in others several feeding chambers connecting to one another may lie between the entry pores
and the spongocoel
While sponges do not exhibit true tissuelayer organization they do have a number of functional tissues
composed of different cell types specialized for distinct functions For example epitheliallike cells called
pinacocytes form the outermost body called a pinacoderm that serves a protective function similar that of
our epidermis Scattered among the pinacoderm are the ostia that allow entry of water into the body of the
sponge These pores have given the sponges their phylum name Poriferaporebearers In some sponges
ostia are formed by porocytes single tubeshaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into
the spongocoel In other sponges ostia are formed by folds in the body wall of the sponge Between the outer
layer and the feeding chambers of the sponge is a jellylike substance called the mesohyl which contains
collagenous fibers Various cell types reside within the mesohyl including amoebocytes the stem cells of
sponges and sclerocytes which produce skeletal materials The gellike consistency of mesohyl acts like an
endoskeleton and maintains the tubular morphology of sponges
The feeding chambers inside the sponge are lined by choanocytes collar cells The structure of a choanocyte
is critical to its function which is to generate a directed water current through the sponge and to trap and
ingest microscopic food particles by phagocytosis These feeding cells are similar in appearance to unicellular
choanoflagellates Protista This similarity suggests that sponges and choanoflagellates are closely related
and likely share common ancestry The body of the choanocyte is embedded in mesohyl and contains all the
organelles required for normal cell function Protruding into the open space inside the feeding chamber is
a meshlike collar composed of microvilli with a single flagellum in the center of the column The beating of
the flagella from all choanocytes draws water into the sponge through the numerous ostia into the spaces
lined by choanocytes and eventually out through the osculum or osculi if the sponge consists of a colony of
attached sponges Food particles including waterborne bacteria and unicellular organisms such as algae and
various animallike protists are trapped by the sievelike collar of the choanocytes slide down toward the body
of the cell and are ingested by phagocytosis Choanocytes also serve another surprising function They can
differentiate into sperm for sexual reproduction at which time they become dislodged from the mesohyl and
leave the sponge with expelled water through the osculum

The amoebocytes derived from stemcelllike archaeocytes are so named because they move throughout
the mesohyl in an amoebalike fashion They have a variety of functions In addition to delivering nutrients from
choanocytes to other cells within the sponge they also give rise to eggs for sexual reproduction The eggs
remain in the mesohyl whereas the sperm cells are released into the water The amoebocytes can differentiate
into other cell types of the sponge such as collenocytes and lophocytes which produce the collagenlike protein
that support the mesohyl Amoebocytes can also give rise to sclerocytes which produce spicules skeletal
spikes of silica or calcium carbonate in some sponges and spongocytes which produce the protein spongin in
the majority of sponges These different cell types in sponges are shown in Figure 283
