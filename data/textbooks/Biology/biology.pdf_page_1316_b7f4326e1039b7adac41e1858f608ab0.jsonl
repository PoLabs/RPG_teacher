Figure 425 In response to a cut mast cells secrete histamines that cause nearby capillaries to dilate Neutrophils and
monocytes leave the capillaries Monocytes mature into macrophages Neutrophils dendritic cells and macrophages
release chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response Neutrophils and macrophages also consume invading
bacteria by phagocytosis
Cytokines also send feedback to cells of the nervous system to bring about the overall symptoms of feeling
sick which include lethargy muscle pain and nausea These effects may have evolved because the symptoms
encourage the individual to rest and prevent the spreading of the infection to others Cytokines also increase
the core body temperature causing a fever which causes the liver to withhold iron from the blood Without iron
certain pathogens such as some bacteria are unable to replicate this is called nutritional immunity

Natural Killer Cells
Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large darkly staining nuclei they are
small cells with very little cytoplasm as shown in Figure 426 Infected cells are identified and destroyed by
natural killer NK cells lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells abnormal cells
that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also
are classified as lymphocytes T cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland and B cells are
lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow NK cells identify intracellular infections especially from viruses by
the altered expression of major histocompatibility class MHC I molecules on the surface of infected cells
MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells thus they are scarce on red blood cells and
platelets which are nonnucleated The function of MHC I molecules is to display fragments of proteins from the
infectious agents within the cell to T cells healthy cells will be ignored while nonself or foreign proteins will
be attacked by the immune system MHC II molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens nonself
proteins and on lymphocytes MHC II molecules interact with helper T cells to trigger the appropriate immune
response which may include the inflammatory response
