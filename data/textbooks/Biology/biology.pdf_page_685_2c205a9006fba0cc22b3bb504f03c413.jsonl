Sexual Reproduction
Sexual reproduction introduces genetic variation into a population of fungi In fungi sexual reproduction often
occurs in response to adverse environmental conditions During sexual reproduction two mating types are
produced When both mating types are present in the same mycelium it is called homothallic or selffertile
Heterothallic mycelia require two different but compatible mycelia to reproduce sexually
Although there are many variations in fungal sexual reproduction all include the following three stages Figure
248 First during plasmogamy literally marriage or union of cytoplasm two haploid cells fuse leading to
a dikaryotic stage where two haploid nuclei coexist in a single cell During karyogamy nuclear marriage the
haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus Finally meiosis takes place in the gametangia singular
gametangium organs in which gametes of different mating types are generated At this stage spores are
disseminated into the environment

242  Classifications of Fungi
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify fungi and place them into the five major phyla according to current classification

Describe each phylum in terms of major representative species and patterns of reproduction
The kingdom Fungi contains five major phyla that were established according to their mode of sexual
reproduction or using molecular data Polyphyletic unrelated fungi that reproduce without a sexual cycle were
once placed for convenience in a sixth group the Deuteromycota called a form phylum because superficially
they appeared to be similar However most mycologists have discontinued this practice Rapid advances in
molecular biology and the sequencing of 18S rRNA ribosomal RNA continue to show new and different
relationships among the various categories of fungi
The five true phyla of fungi are the Chytridiomycota Chytrids the Zygomycota conjugated fungi the
Ascomycota sac fungi the Basidiomycota club fungi and the recently described Phylum Glomeromycota
