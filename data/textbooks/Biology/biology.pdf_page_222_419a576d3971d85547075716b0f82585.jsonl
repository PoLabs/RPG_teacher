Figure 711 ATP synthase is a complex molecular machine that uses a proton H gradient to form ATP from
ADP and inorganic phosphate Pi Credit modification of work by Klaus Hoffmeier
Dinitrophenol DNP is an uncoupler that makes the inner mitochondrial membrane leaky to protons It
was used until 1938 as a weightloss drug What effect would you expect DNP to have on the change in pH
across the inner mitochondrial membrane Why do you think this might be an effective weightloss drug
Chemiosmosis Figure 712 is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during aerobic glucose catabolism
it is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight in the process
of photophosphorylation Recall that the production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis in mitochondria
is called oxidative phosphorylation The overall result of these reactions is the production of ATP from the energy
of the electrons removed from hydrogen atoms These atoms were originally part of a glucose molecule At the
end of the pathway the electrons are used to reduce an oxygen molecule to oxygen ions The extra electrons
on the oxygen attract hydrogen ions protons from the surrounding medium and water is formed Thus oxygen
is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain
