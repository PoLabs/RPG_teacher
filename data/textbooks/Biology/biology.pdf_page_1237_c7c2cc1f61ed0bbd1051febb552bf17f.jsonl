Figure 397 Air enters the respiratory system through the nasal cavity and pharynx and then passes through the
trachea and into the bronchi which bring air into the lungs credit modification of work by NCI
Which of the following statements about the mammalian respiratory system is false
a
When we breathe in air travels from the pharynx to the trachea
b
The bronchioles branch into bronchi
c
Alveolar ducts connect to alveolar sacs
d
Gas exchange between the lung and blood takes place in the alveolus
From the nasal cavity air passes through the pharynx throat and the larynx voice box as it makes its way
to the trachea Figure 397 The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the
exhaled air back out of the body The human trachea is a cylinder about 10 to 12 cm long and 2 cm in diameter
that sits in front of the esophagus and extends from the larynx into the chest cavity where it divides into the
two primary bronchi at the midthorax It is made of incomplete rings of hyaline cartilage and smooth muscle
Figure 398 The trachea is lined with mucusproducing goblet cells and ciliated epithelia The cilia propel
foreign particles trapped in the mucus toward the pharynx The cartilage provides strength and support to the
trachea to keep the passage open The smooth muscle can contract decreasing the tracheas diameter which
causes expired air to rush upwards from the lungs at a great force The forced exhalation helps expel mucus
when we cough Smooth muscle can contract or relax depending on stimuli from the external environment or
the bodys nervous system
