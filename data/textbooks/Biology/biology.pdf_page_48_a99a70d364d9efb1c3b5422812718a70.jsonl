For example the atomic mass of chlorine Cl is 3545 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes some
the majority with atomic mass 35 17 protons and 18 neutrons and some with atomic mass 37 17 protons and
20 neutrons
Figure 23 Carbon has an atomic number of six and two stable isotopes with mass numbers of twelve and
thirteen respectively Its relative atomic mass is 12011
How many neutrons do carbon12 and carbon13 have respectively
Isotopes
Isotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number
of neutrons Some elementssuch as carbon potassium and uraniumhave naturally occurring isotopes
Carbon12 contains six protons six neutrons and six electrons therefore it has a mass number of 12 six
protons and six neutrons Carbon14 contains six protons eight neutrons and six electrons its atomic mass is
14 six protons and eight neutrons These two alternate forms of carbon are isotopes Some isotopes may emit
neutrons protons and electrons and attain a more stable atomic configuration lower level of potential energy
these are radioactive isotopes or radioisotopes Radioactive decay carbon14 decaying to eventually become
nitrogen14 describes the energy loss that occurs when an unstable atoms nucleus releases radiation
