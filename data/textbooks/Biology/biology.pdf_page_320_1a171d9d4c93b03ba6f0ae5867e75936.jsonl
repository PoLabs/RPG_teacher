Figure 113 Crossover occurs between nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes The result is an exchange
of genetic material between homologous chromosomes
Prometaphase I
The key event in prometaphase I is the attachment of the spindle fiber microtubules to the kinetochore proteins at
the centromeres Kinetochore proteins are multiprotein complexes that bind the centromeres of a chromosome
to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle Microtubules grow from microtubuleorganizing centers MTOCs
In animal cells MTOCs are centrosomes located at opposite poles of the cell The microtubules from each
pole move toward the middle of the cell and attach to one of the kinetochores of the two fused homologous
chromosomes Each member of the homologous pair attaches to a microtubule extending from opposite poles
of the cell so that in the next phase the microtubules can pull the homologous pair apart A spindle fiber that
has attached to a kinetochore is called a kinetochore microtubule At the end of prometaphase I each tetrad is
attached to microtubules from both poles with one homologous chromosome facing each pole The homologous
chromosomes are still held together at the chiasmata In addition the nuclear membrane has broken down
entirely
Metaphase I
During metaphase I the homologous chromosomes are arranged at the metaphase plateroughly in the
midline of the cell with the kinetochores facing opposite poles The homologous pairs orient themselves
randomly at the equator For example if the two homologous members of chromosome 1 are labeled a and b
then the chromosomes could line up ab or ba This is important in determining the genes carried by a gamete
as each will only receive one of the two homologous chromosomes Recall that after crossing over takes place
homologous chromosomes are not identical They contain slight differences in their genetic information causing
each gamete to have a unique genetic makeup
The randomness in the alignment of recombined chromosomes at the metaphase plate coupled with the
crossing over events between nonsister chromatids are responsible for much of the genetic variation in
