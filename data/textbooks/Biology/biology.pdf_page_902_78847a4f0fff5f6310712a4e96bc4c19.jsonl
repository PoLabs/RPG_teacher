Figure 2948 Lucy This adult female Australopithecus afarensis skeleton nicknamed Lucy was discovered in the
mid1970s credit 120Wikimedia Commons
Australopithecus africanus lived between two and three million years ago It had a slender build and was bipedal
but had robust arm bones and like other early hominids may have spent significant time in trees Its brain was
larger than that of A afarensis at 500 cubic centimeters which is slightly less than onethird the size of modern
human brains Two other species Australopithecus bahrelghazali and Australopithecus garhi have been added
to the roster of australopiths in recent years A bahrelghazali is unusual in being the only australopith found in
Central Africa
A Dead End Genus Paranthropus
The australopiths had a relatively slender build and teeth that were suited for soft food In the past several
years fossils of hominids of a different body type have been found and dated to approximately 25 million years
ago These hominids of the genus Paranthropus were muscular stood 13 to 14 meters tall and had large
grinding teeth Their molars showed heavy wear suggesting that they had a coarse and fibrous vegetarian diet
as opposed to the partially carnivorous diet of the australopiths Paranthropus includes Paranthropus robustus of
South Africa and Paranthropus aethiopicus and Paranthropus boisei of East Africa The hominids in this genus
went extinct more than one million years ago and are not thought to be ancestral to modern humans but rather
members of an evolutionary branch on the hominin tree that left no descendants
Early Hominins Genus Homo
The human genus Homo first appeared between 25 and three million years ago For many years fossils of a
species called H habilis were the oldest examples in the genus Homo but in 2010 a new species called Homo
gautengensis was discovered and may be older Compared to A africanus H habilis had a number of features
more similar to modern humans H habilis had a jaw that was less prognathic than the australopiths and a larger
brain at 600 to 750 cubic centimeters However H habilis retained some features of older hominin species
such as long arms The name H habilis means handy man which is a reference to the stone tools that have
been found with its remains
