edition
Pedagogical foundation
The pedagogical choices chapter arrangements and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted
with the feedback of another one hundred reviewers who thoroughly read the material and offered detailed

Career Connection features present information on a variety of careers in the biological sciences
introducing students to the educational requirements and daytoday work life of a variety of professions

Killer
Art and animations that engage
Our art program takes a straightforward approach designed to help students learn the concepts of biology
through simple effective illustrations photos and micrographs Biology 2e also incorporates links to relevant
animations and interactive exercises that help bring biology to life for students
Visual Connection features call out core figures in each chapter for student study Questions about 
key figures including clicker questions that can be used in the classroom engage students critical thinking 
and analytical abilities to ensure their genuine understanding
Link to Learning features direct students to online interactive exercises and animations to add a fuller
context and examples to core content
