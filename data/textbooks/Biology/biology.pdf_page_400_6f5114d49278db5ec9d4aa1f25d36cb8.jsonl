Figure 1412 The three suggested models of DNA replication Gray indicates the original DNA strands and blue
indicates newly synthesized DNA
In conservative replication the parental DNA remains together and the newly formed daughter strands are
together The semiconservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands acts as a template
for new DNA to be synthesized after replication each doublestranded DNA includes one parental or old
strand and one new strand In the dispersive model both copies of DNA have doublestranded segments of
parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA interspersed
Meselson and Stahl were interested in understanding how DNA replicates They grew E coli for several
generations in a medium containing a heavy isotope of nitrogen 15N which gets incorporated into nitrogenous
bases and eventually into the DNA Figure 1413
