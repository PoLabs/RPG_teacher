Furthermore natural selection can be constrained by the relationships between different polymorphisms One
morph may confer a higher fitness than another but may not increase in frequency because going from the less
beneficial to the more beneficial trait would require going through a less beneficial phenotype Think back to the
mice that live at the beach Some are lightcolored and blend in with the sand while others are dark and blend in
with the patches of grass The darkcolored mice may be overall more fit than the lightcolored mice and at first
glance one might expect the lightcolored mice to be selected for a darker coloration However remember that
the intermediate phenotype a mediumcolored coat is very bad for the micethey cannot blend in with either
the sand or the grass and predators are more likely to eat them As a result the lightcolored mice would not be
selected for a dark coloration because those individuals who began moving in that direction began selection for
a darker coat would be less fit than those that stayed light
Finally it is important to understand that not all evolution is adaptive While natural selection selects the fittest
individuals and often results in a more fit population overall other forces of evolution including genetic drift and
gene flow often do the opposite introducing deleterious alleles to the populations gene pool Evolution has no
purposeit is not changing a population into a preconceived ideal It is simply the sum of the various forces that
we have described in this chapter and how they influence the populations genetic and phenotypic variance
