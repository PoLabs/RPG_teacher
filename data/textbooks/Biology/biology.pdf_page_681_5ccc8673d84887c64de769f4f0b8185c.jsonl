c In most phyla of fungi tiny holes in the septa allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from
cell to cell along the hypha They are described as perforated septa The hyphae in bread molds which belong
to the Phylum Zygomycota are not separated by septa Instead they are formed by large cells containing many
nuclei multinucleate an arrangement described as coenocytic hyphae Figure 245b

Fungi thrive in environments that are moist and slightly acidic and can grow with or without light They vary in
their oxygen requirement Most fungi are obligate aerobes requiring oxygen to survive Other species such as
members of the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle are obligate anaerobes in that they only use
anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them Yeasts are intermediate being
facultative anaerobes This means that they grow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration
but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not available The alcohol produced from yeast
fermentation is used in wine and beer production
Nutrition
Like animals fungi are heterotrophs they use complex organic compounds as a source of carbon rather than
fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as do some bacteria and most plants In addition fungi do not fix
nitrogen from the atmosphere Like animals they must obtain it from their diet However unlike most animals
which ingest food and then digest it internally in specialized organs fungi perform these steps in the reverse
order digestion precedes ingestion First exoenzymes are transported out of the hyphae where they process
nutrients in the environment Then the smaller molecules produced by this external digestion are absorbed
through the large surface area of the mycelium As with animal cells the polysaccharide of storage is glycogen
a branched polysaccaride rather than amylopectin a less densely branched polysaccharide and amylose a
linear polysaccharide as found in plants
Fungi are mostly saprobes saprophyte is an equivalent term organisms that derive nutrients from decaying
organic matter They obtain their nutrients from dead or decomposing organic material derived mainly from
plants Fungal exoenzymes are able to break down insoluble compounds such as the cellulose and lignin
of dead wood into readily absorbable glucose molecules The carbon nitrogen and other elements are thus
released into the environment Because of their varied metabolic pathways fungi fulfill an important ecological
role and are being investigated as potential tools in bioremediation of chemically damaged ecosystems For
example some species of fungi can be used to break down diesel oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
PAHs Other species take up heavy metals such as cadmium and lead
Some fungi are parasitic infecting either plants or animals Smut and Dutch elm disease affect plants whereas
athletes foot and candidiasis thrush are medically important fungal infections in humans In environments poor
