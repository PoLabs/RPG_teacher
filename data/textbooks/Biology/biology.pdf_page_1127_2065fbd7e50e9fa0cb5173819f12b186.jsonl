detect warmth Note that these warmth detectors are situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors It is
not surprising then that humans detect cold stimuli before they detect warm stimuli
Pacinian corpuscles seen in Figure 367 are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and
are structurally similar to Meissners corpuscles they are found in the bone periosteum joint capsules pancreas
and other viscera breast and genitals They are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient
but not prolonged pressure and highfrequency vibration Pacinian receptors detect pressure and vibration by
being compressed stimulating their internal dendrites There are fewer Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings
in skin than there are Merkels disks and Meissners corpuscles

In proprioception proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals travel through myelinated afferent neurons running from
the spinal cord to the medulla Neurons are not physically connected but communicate via neurotransmitters
secreted into synapses or gaps between communicating neurons Once in the medulla the neurons continue
carrying the signals to the thalamus
Muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch or lengthening of muscles Related
to these are Golgi tendon organs which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction
Proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals come from limbs Unconscious proprioceptive signals run from the spinal
cord to the cerebellum the brain region that coordinates muscle contraction rather than to the thalamus like
most other sensory information
Baroreceptors detect pressure changes in an organ They are found in the walls of the carotid artery and the
aorta where they monitor blood pressure and in the lungs where they detect the degree of lung expansion
Stretch receptors are found at various sites in the digestive and urinary systems
In addition to these two types of deeper receptors there are also rapidly adapting hair receptors which are found
on nerve endings that wrap around the base of hair follicles There are a few types of hair receptors that detect
slow and rapid hair movement and they differ in their sensitivity to movement Some hair receptors also detect
skin deflection and certain rapidly adapting hair receptors allow detection of stimuli that have not yet touched
the skin
Integration of Signals from Mechanoreceptors
The configuration of the different types of receptors working in concert in human skin results in a very refined
sense of touch The nociceptive receptorsthose that detect painare located near the surface Small finely
calibrated mechanoreceptorsMerkels disks and Meissners corpusclesare located in the upper layers
and can precisely localize even gentle touch The large mechanoreceptorsPacinian corpuscles and Ruffini
endingsare located in the lower layers and respond to deeper touch Consider that the deep pressure
that reaches those deeper receptors would not need to be finely localized Both the upper and lower layers
of the skin hold rapidly and slowly adapting receptors Both primary somatosensory cortex and secondary
cortical areas are responsible for processing the complex picture of stimuli transmitted from the interplay of
mechanoreceptors
