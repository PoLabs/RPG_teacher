In some cases populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a
place that no longer overlaps with the same species other populations We call this situation habitat isolation
Reproduction with the parent species ceases and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically
independent For example a cricket population that was divided after a flood could no longer interact with each
other Over time natural selection forces mutation and genetic drift will likely result in the two groups diverging

Figure 1818 Speciation can occur when two populations occupy different habitats The habitats need not be far apart
The cricket a Gryllus pennsylvanicus prefers sandy soil and the cricket b Gryllus firmus prefers loamy soil The two
species can live in close proximity but because of their different soil preferences they became genetically isolated
Behavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction For
example male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females Various firefly species display their lights
differently If a male of one species tried to attract the female of another she would not recognize the light pattern
and would not mate with the male
Other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells eggs and sperm prevent fertilization from
taking place We call this a gametic barrier Similarly in some cases closely related organisms try to mate but
their reproductive structures simply do not fit together For example damselfly males of different species have
differently shaped reproductive organs If one species tries to mate with the female of another their body parts
simply do not fit together Figure 1819
Figure 1819 The shape of the male reproductive organ varies among male damselfly species and is only compatible
with the female of that species Reproductive organ incompatibility keeps the species reproductively isolated
In plants certain structures aimed to attract one type of pollinator simultaneously prevent a different pollinator
from accessing the pollen The tunnel through which an animal must access nectar can vary widely in length and
