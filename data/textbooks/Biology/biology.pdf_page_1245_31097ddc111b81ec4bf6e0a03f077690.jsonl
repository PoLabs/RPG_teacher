393  Breathing
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how the structures of the lungs and thoracic cavity control the mechanics of breathing

Explain the importance of compliance and resistance in the lungs

Discuss problems that may arise due to a VQ mismatch
Mammalian lungs are located in the thoracic cavity where they are surrounded and protected by the rib cage
intercostal muscles and bound by the chest wall The bottom of the lungs is contained by the diaphragm a
skeletal muscle that facilitates breathing Breathing requires the coordination of the lungs the chest wall and
most importantly the diaphragm
Types of Breathing
Amphibians have evolved multiple ways of breathing Young amphibians like tadpoles use gills to breathe and
they dont leave the water Some amphibians retain gills for life As the tadpole grows the gills disappear and
lungs grow These lungs are primitive and not as evolved as mammalian lungs Adult amphibians are lacking
or have a reduced diaphragm so breathing via lungs is forced The other means of breathing for amphibians is
diffusion across the skin To aid this diffusion amphibian skin must remain moist
Birds face a unique challenge with respect to breathing They fly Flying consumes a great amount of energy
therefore birds require a lot of oxygen to aid their metabolic processes Birds have evolved a respiratory system
that supplies them with the oxygen needed to enable flying Similar to mammals birds have lungs which are
organs specialized for gas exchange Oxygenated air taken in during inhalation diffuses across the surface of
the lungs into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs and expelled during
exhalation The details of breathing between birds and mammals differ substantially
In addition to lungs birds have air sacs inside their body Air flows in one direction from the posterior air sacs
to the lungs and out of the anterior air sacs The flow of air is in the opposite direction from blood flow and gas
exchange takes place much more efficiently This type of breathing enables birds to obtain the requisite oxygen
even at higher altitudes where the oxygen concentration is low This directionality of airflow requires two cycles
of air intake and exhalation to completely get the air out of the lungs
