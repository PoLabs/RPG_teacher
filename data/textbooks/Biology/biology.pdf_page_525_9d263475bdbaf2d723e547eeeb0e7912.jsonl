CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
17 If a person scatters a handful of garden pea plant
seeds in one area how would natural selection work
in this situation
18 Why do scientists consider vestigial structures
evidence for evolution
19 How does the scientific meaning of theory differ
from the common vernacular meaning
20 Explain why the statement that a monkey is more

What might take place in this situation
