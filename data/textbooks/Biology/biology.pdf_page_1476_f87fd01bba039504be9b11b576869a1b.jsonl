methodologies Some ecologists study ecosystems using controlled experimental systems while some study
entire ecosystems in their natural state and others use both approaches
A holistic ecosystem model attempts to quantify the composition interaction and dynamics of entire
ecosystems it is the most representative of the ecosystem in its natural state A food web is an example of a
holistic ecosystem model However this type of study is limited by time and expense as well as the fact that it
is neither feasible nor ethical to do experiments on large natural ecosystems It is difficult to quantify all different
species in an ecosystem and the dynamics in their habitat especially when studying large habitats such as the
Amazon Rainforest
For these reasons scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions Experimental systems usually
involve either partitioning a part of a natural ecosystem that can be used for experiments termed a mesocosm
or by recreating an ecosystem entirely in an indoor or outdoor laboratory environment which is referred
to as a microcosm A major limitation to these approaches is that removing individual organisms from
their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem through partitioning may change the dynamics of
the ecosystem These changes are often due to differences in species numbers and diversity and also to
environment alterations caused by partitioning mesocosm or recreating microcosm the natural habitat Thus
these types of experiments are not totally predictive of changes that would occur in the ecosystem from which
they were gathered
As both of these approaches have their limitations some ecologists suggest that results from these experimental
systems should be used only in conjunction with holistic ecosystem studies to obtain the most representative
data about ecosystem structure function and dynamics
Scientists use the data generated by these experimental studies to develop ecosystem models that demonstrate
the structure and dynamics of ecosystems They use three basic types of ecosystem modeling in research
and ecosystem management a conceptual model an analytical model and a simulation model A conceptual
model is an ecosystem model that consists of flow charts to show interactions of different compartments of
the living and nonliving components of the ecosystem A conceptual model describes ecosystem structure
and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances affect the ecosystem however its ability to predict
the effects of these disturbances is limited Analytical and simulation models in contrast are mathematical
methods of describing ecosystems that are indeed capable of predicting the effects of potential environmental
changes without direct experimentation although with some limitations as to accuracy An analytical model is
an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental
disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created
using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental
disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics Ideally these models are accurate enough to determine
which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances and they can serve as a guide
to ecosystem managers such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists in the practical maintenance of
ecosystem health
Conceptual Models
Conceptual models are useful for describing ecosystem structure and dynamics and for demonstrating the
relationships between different organisms in a community and their environment Conceptual models are usually
depicted graphically as flow charts The organisms and their resources are grouped into specific compartments
with arrows showing the relationship and transfer of energy or nutrients between them Thus these diagrams
are sometimes called compartment models
To model the cycling of mineral nutrients organic and inorganic nutrients are subdivided into those that are
bioavailable ready to be incorporated into biological macromolecules and those that are not For example
in a terrestrial ecosystem near a deposit of coal carbon will be available to the plants of this ecosystem as
carbon dioxide gas in a shortterm period not from the carbonrich coal itself However over a longer period
microorganisms capable of digesting coal will incorporate its carbon or release it as natural gas methane CH4
changing this unavailable organic source into an available one This conversion is greatly accelerated by the
combustion of fossil fuels by humans which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere This
is thought to be a major factor in the rise of the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the industrial age The
carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels is produced faster than photosynthetic organisms can use it
This process is intensified by the reduction of photosynthetic trees because of worldwide deforestation Most
scientists agree that high atmospheric carbon dioxide is a major cause of global climate change
Conceptual models are also used to show the flow of energy through particular ecosystems Figure 468 is
based on Howard T Odums classical study of the Silver Springs Florida holistic ecosystem in the midtwentieth
