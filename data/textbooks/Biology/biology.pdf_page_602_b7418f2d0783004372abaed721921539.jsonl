Figure 224 Cyanobacteria This hot spring in Yellowstone National Park flows toward the foreground Cyanobacteria
in the spring are green and as water flows down the gradient the intensity of the color increases as cell density
increases The water is cooler at the edges of the stream than in the center causing the edges to appear greener

Microbes Are Adaptable Life in Moderate and Extreme Environments
Some organisms have developed strategies that allow them to survive harsh conditions Almost all prokaryotes
have a cell wall a protective structure that allows them to survive in both hypertonic and hypotonic aqueous
conditions Some soil bacteria are able to form endospores that resist heat and drought thereby allowing the
organism to survive until favorable conditions recur These adaptations along with others allow bacteria to
remain the most abundant life form in all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
Prokaryotes thrive in a vast array of environments Some grow in conditions that would seem very normal to
us whereas others are able to thrive and grow under conditions that would kill a plant or an animal Bacteria
and archaea that are adapted to grow under extreme conditions are called extremophiles meaning lovers of
extremes Extremophiles have been found in all kinds of environments the depths of the oceans hot springs
the Arctic and the Antarctic in very dry places deep inside Earth in harsh chemical environments and in high
radiation environments Figure 225 just to mention a few Because they have specialized adaptations that
allow them to live in extreme conditions many extremophiles cannot survive in moderate environments There
are many different groups of extremophiles They are identified based on the conditions in which they grow
best and several habitats are extreme in multiple ways For example a soda lake is both salty and alkaline so
organisms that live in a soda lake must be both alkaliphiles and halophiles Table 221 Other extremophiles
like radioresistant organisms do not prefer an extreme environment in this case one with high levels of
radiation but have adapted to survive in it Figure 225 Organisms like these give us a better understanding of
prokaryotic diversity and open up the possibility of finding new prokaryotic species that may lead to the discovery
of new therapeutic drugs or have industrial applications
