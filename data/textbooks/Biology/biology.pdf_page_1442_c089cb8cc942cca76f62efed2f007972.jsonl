taste the presence of toxic chemicals andor the ability to sting or bite respectively Predators that ignore this
coloration and eat the organisms will experience their unpleasant taste or presence of toxic chemicals and learn
not to eat them in the future This type of defensive mechanism is called aposematic coloration or warning
coloration Figure 4521
Figure 4521 a The strawberry poison dart frog Oophaga pumilio uses aposematic coloration to warn predators
that it is toxic while the b striped skunk Mephitis mephitis uses aposematic coloration to warn predators of the
unpleasant odor it produces credit a modification of work by Jay Iwasaki credit b modification of work by Dan

While some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration other species have
evolved mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten even though they themselves may not be
unpleasant to eat or contain toxic chemicals In Batesian mimicry a harmless species imitates the warning
coloration of a harmful one Assuming they share the same predators this coloration then protects the harmless
ones even though they do not have the same level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as the
organism they mimic Many insect species mimic the coloration of wasps or bees which are stinging venomous
insects thereby discouraging predation Figure 4522

In Mllerian mimicry multiple species share the same warning coloration but all of them actually have
defenses Figure 4523 shows a variety of foultasting butterflies with similar coloration In Emsleyan
Mertensian mimicry a deadly prey mimics a less dangerous one such as the venomous coral snake mimicking
the nonvenomous milk snake This type of mimicry is extremely rare and more difficult to understand than the
previous two types For this type of mimicry to work it is essential that eating the milk snake has unpleasant but
not fatal consequences Then these predators learn not to eat snakes with this coloration protecting the coral
snake as well If the snake were fatal to the predator there would be no opportunity for the predator to learn not
to eat it and the benefit for the less toxic species would disappear
