triploblast
blastopore develops into the mouth of protostomes with the second opening developing into the
anus
animal with a body cavity located between the mesoderm and endoderm
cleavage axes are parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis resulting in the alignment of cells
between the two poles
type of symmetry with multiple planes of symmetry with body parts rays arranged around a
central disk
during development of protostomes a solid mass of mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow
opening of the coelom
cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated or misaligned with respect to the cells of the
opposite pole
animal that develops from three germ layers
CHAPTER SUMMARY
271 Features of the Animal Kingdom
Animals constitute an incredibly diverse kingdom of organisms Although animals range in complexity from
simple sea sponges to human beings most members of the animal kingdom share certain features Animals
are eukaryotic multicellular heterotrophic organisms that ingest their food and usually develop into motile
creatures with a fixed body plan A major characteristic unique to the animal kingdom is the presence of
differentiated tissues such as nerve muscle and connective tissues which are specialized to perform specific
functions Most animals undergo sexual reproduction leading to a series of developmental embryonic stages
that are relatively similar across the animal kingdom A class of transcriptional control genes called Hox genes
directs the organization of the major animal body plans and these genes are strongly homologous across the
animal kingdom
272 Features Used to Classify Animals
Organisms in the animal kingdom are classified based on their body morphology their developmental
pathways and their genetic affinities The relationships between the Eumetazoa and more basal clades
Ctenophora Porifera and Placozoa are still being debated The Eumetazoa true animals are divided into
those with radial versus bilateral symmetry Generally the simpler and often nonmotile animals display radial
symmetry which allows them to explore their environment in all directions Animals with radial symmetry are
also generally characterized by the development of two embryological germ layers the endoderm and
ectoderm whereas animals with bilateral symmetry are generally characterized by the development of a third
embryologic germ layer the mesoderm Animals with three germ layers called triploblasts are further
characterized by the presence or absence of an internal body cavity called a coelom The presence of a
coelom affords many advantages and animals with a coelom may be termed true coelomates or
pseudocoelomates depending the extent to which mesoderm lines the body cavity Coelomates are further
divided into one of two groups called protostomes and deuterostomes based on a number of developmental
characteristics including differences in zygote cleavage the method of coelom formation and the rigidity of the
developmental fate of blastomeres
273 Animal Phylogeny
Scientists are interested in the evolutionary history of animals and the evolutionary relationships among them
There are three main sources of data that scientists use to create phylogenetic evolutionary tree diagrams that
illustrate such relationships morphological information which includes developmental morphologies fossil
record data and most recently molecular data The details of the modern phylogenetic tree change frequently
as new data are gathered and molecular data has recently contributed to many substantial modifications of the
understanding of relationships between animal phyla
