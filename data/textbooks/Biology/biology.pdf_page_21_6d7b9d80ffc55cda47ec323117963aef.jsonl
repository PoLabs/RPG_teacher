such as physics and chemistry but when it comes to disciplines like archaeology psychology and geology the
scientific method becomes less applicable as repeating experiments becomes more difficult
These areas of study are still sciences however Consider archaeologyeven though one cannot perform
repeatable experiments hypotheses may still be supported For instance an archaeologist can hypothesize that
an ancient culture existed based on finding a piece of pottery He or she could make further hypotheses about
various characteristics of this culture which could be correct or false through continued support or contradictions
from other findings A hypothesis may become a verified theory A theory is a tested and confirmed explanation
for observations or phenomena Therefore we may be better off to define science as fields of study that attempt
to comprehend the nature of the universe
Natural Sciences
What would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences Frogs Plants Dinosaur skeletons Exhibits
about how the brain functions A planetarium Gems and minerals Maybe all of the above Science includes
such diverse fields as astronomy biology computer sciences geology logic physics chemistry and
mathematics Figure 14 However scientists consider those fields of science related to the physical world and
its phenomena and processes natural sciences Thus a museum of natural sciences might contain any of the
items listed above

There is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences include however
For some experts the natural sciences are astronomy biology chemistry earth science and physics Other
scholars choose to divide natural sciences into life sciences which study living things and include biology and
physical sciences which study nonliving matter and include astronomy geology physics and chemistry Some
disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary
Some refer to natural sciences as hard science because they rely on the use of quantitative data Social
sciences that study society and human behavior are more likely to use qualitative assessments to drive
investigations and findings
Not surprisingly the natural science of biology has many branches or subdisciplines Cell biologists study cell
