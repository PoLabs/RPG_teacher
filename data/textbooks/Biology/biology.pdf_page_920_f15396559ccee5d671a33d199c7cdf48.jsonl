leaves against predation by herbivores
Figure 308 Openings called stomata singular stoma allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and
water vapor The a colorized scanningelectron micrograph shows a closed stoma of a dicot Each stoma is flanked
by two guard cells that regulate its b opening and closing The c guard cells sit within the layer of epidermal cells

Vascular Tissue
The xylem and phloem that make up the vascular tissue of the stem are arranged in distinct strands called
vascular bundles which run up and down the length of the stem When the stem is viewed in cross section the
vascular bundles of dicot stems are arranged in a ring In plants with stems that live for more than one year the
individual bundles grow together and produce the characteristic growth rings In monocot stems the vascular
bundles are randomly scattered throughout the ground tissue Figure 309
Figure 309 In a dicot stems vascular bundles are arranged around the periphery of the ground tissue The xylem
tissue is located toward the interior of the vascular bundle and phloem is located toward the exterior Sclerenchyma
fibers cap the vascular bundles In b monocot stems vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem tissues are
scattered throughout the ground tissue
Xylem tissue has three types of cells xylem parenchyma tracheids and vessel elements The latter two types
conduct water and are dead at maturity Tracheids are xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are
lignified Water moves from one tracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits where
secondary walls are absent Vessel elements are xylem cells with thinner walls they are shorter than tracheids
Each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a perforation plate at the end walls of the element
Water moves through the perforation plates to travel up the plant
