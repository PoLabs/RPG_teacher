Rheumatologist
Rheumatologists are medical doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the
joints muscles and bones They diagnose and treat diseases such as arthritis musculoskeletal disorders
osteoporosis and autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis RA is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints of the hands
feet and cervical spine Affected joints become swollen stiff and painful Although it is known that RA is an
autoimmune disease in which the bodys immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue the cause of RA
remains unknown Immune cells from the blood enter joints and the synovium causing cartilage breakdown
swelling and inflammation of the joint lining Breakdown of cartilage causes bones to rub against each other
causing pain RA is more common in women than men and the age of onset is usually 4050 years of age
Rheumatologists can diagnose RA on the basis of symptoms such as joint inflammation and pain Xray and
MRI imaging and blood tests Arthrography is a type of medical imaging of joints that uses a contrast agent
such as a dye that is opaque to Xrays This allows the soft tissue structures of jointssuch as cartilage
tendons and ligamentsto be visualized An arthrogram differs from a regular Xray by showing the surface
of soft tissues lining the joint in addition to joint bones An arthrogram allows early degenerative changes in
joint cartilage to be detected before bones become affected
There is currently no cure for RA however rheumatologists have a number of treatment options available
Early stages can be treated with rest of the affected joints by using a cane or by using joint splints that
minimize inflammation When inflammation has decreased exercise can be used to strengthen the muscles
that surround the joint and to maintain joint flexibility If joint damage is more extensive medications can
be used to relieve pain and decrease inflammation Antiinflammatory drugs such as aspirin topical pain
relievers and corticosteroid injections may be used Surgery may be required in cases in which joint
damage is severe
384  Muscle Contraction and Locomotion
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Classify the different types of muscle tissue

Explain the role of muscles in locomotion
Muscle cells are specialized for contraction Muscles allow for motions such as walking and they also facilitate
bodily processes such as respiration and digestion The body contains three types of muscle tissue skeletal
muscle cardiac muscle and smooth muscle Figure 3833
