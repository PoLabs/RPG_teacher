signals and glia cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role
that is complementary to neurons A neuron can be compared to an electrical wireit transmits a signal from
one place to another Glia can be compared to the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to
the right places maintain the wires and take down wires that are broken Although glia have been compared to
workers recent evidence suggests that they also usurp some of the signaling functions of neurons
There is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in different parts of the nervous system
There are four major types of neurons and they share several important cellular components
Neurons
The nervous system of the common laboratory fly Drosophila melanogaster contains around 100000 neurons
the same number as a lobster This number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the octopus
A human brain contains around 86 billion neurons Despite these very different numbers the nervous systems
of these animals control many of the same behaviorsfrom basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like
finding food and courting mates The ability of neurons to communicate with each other as well as with other
types of cells underlies all of these behaviors
Most neurons share the same cellular components But neurons are also highly specializeddifferent types of
neurons have different sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles
Parts of a Neuron
Like other cells each neuron has a cell body or soma that contains a nucleus smooth and rough endoplasmic
reticulum Golgi apparatus mitochondria and other cellular components Neurons also contain unique
structures illustrated in Figure 353 for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal
communication possible Dendrites are treelike structures that extend away from the cell body to receive
messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called synapses Although some neurons do not have
any dendrites some types of neurons have multiple dendrites Dendrites can have small protrusions called
dendritic spines which further increase surface area for possible synaptic connections
Once a signal is received by the dendrite it then travels passively to the cell body The cell body contains a
specialized structure the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction
between the cell body and an axon An axon is a tubelike structure that propagates the integrated signal to
specialized endings called axon terminals These terminals in turn synapse on other neurons muscle or target
organs Chemicals released at axon terminals allow signals to be communicated to these other cells Neurons
usually have one or two axons but some neurons like amacrine cells in the retina do not contain any axons
Some axons are covered with myelin which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal
as it travels down the axon greatly increasing the speed of conduction This insulation is important as the axon
from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meterfrom the base of the spine to the toes The myelin
sheath is not actually part of the neuron Myelin is produced by glial cells Along the axon there are periodic gaps
in the myelin sheath These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is recharged as
it travels along the axon
It is important to note that a single neuron does not act aloneneuronal communication depends on the
connections that neurons make with one another as well as with other cells like muscle cells Dendrites from
a single neuron may receive synaptic contact from many other neurons For example dendrites from a Purkinje
cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive contact from as many as 200000 other neurons
