An antibody also known as an immunoglobulin Ig is a protein that is produced by plasma cells after
stimulation by an antigen Antibodies are the functional basis of humoral immunity Antibodies occur in the blood
in gastric and mucus secretions and in breast milk Antibodies in these bodily fluids can bind pathogens and
mark them for destruction by phagocytes before they can infect cells
Antibody Structure
An antibody molecule is comprised of four polypeptides two identical heavy chains large peptide units that are
partially bound to each other in a Y formation which are flanked by two identical light chains small peptide
units as illustrated in Figure 4222 Bonds between the cysteine amino acids in the antibody molecule attach
the polypeptides to each other The areas where the antigen is recognized on the antibody are variable domains
and the antibody base is composed of constant domains
In germline B cells the variable region of the light chain gene has 40 variable V and five joining J segments
An enzyme called DNA recombinase randomly excises most of these segments out of the gene and splices
one V segment to one J segment During RNA processing all but one V and J segment are spliced out
Recombination and splicing may result in over 106 possible VJ combinations As a result each differentiated B
cell in the human body typically has a unique variable chain The constant domain which does not bind antibody
is the same for all antibodies
