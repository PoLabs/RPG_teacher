Figure 910 The epidermal growth factor EGF receptor EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in
the regulation of cell growth wound healing and tissue repair When EGF binds to the EGFR a cascade of
downstream events causes the cell to grow and divide If EGFR is activated at inappropriate times uncontrolled
cell growth cancer may occur
In certain cancers the GTPase activity of the RAS Gprotein is inhibited This means that the RAS protein
can no longer hydrolyze GTP into GDP What effect would this have on downstream cellular events
You can see that signaling pathways can get very complicated very quickly because most cellular proteins can
affect different downstream events depending on the conditions within the cell A single pathway can branch
off toward different endpoints based on the interplay between two or more signaling pathways and the same
ligands are often used to initiate different signals in different cell types This variation in response is due to
differences in protein expression in different cell types Another complicating element is signal integration of
the pathways in which signals from two or more different cellsurface receptors merge to activate the same
response in the cell This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits
to a specific response
The effects of extracellular signals can also be amplified by enzymatic cascades At the initiation of the signal
