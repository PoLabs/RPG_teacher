Figure 3621 When light strikes rhodopsin the Gprotein transducin is activated which in turn activates
phosphodiesterase Phosphodiesterase converts cGMP to GMP thereby closing sodium channels As a result the
membrane becomes hyperpolarized The hyperpolarized membrane does not release glutamate to the bipolar cell
Trichromatic Coding
There are three types of cones with different photopsins and they differ in the wavelength to which they are
most responsive as shown in Figure 3622 Some cones are maximally responsive to short light waves of 420
nm so they are called S cones S for short others respond maximally to waves of 530 nm M cones for
medium a third group responds maximally to light of longer wavelengths at 560 nm L or long cones With
only one type of cone color vision would not be possible and a twocone dichromatic system has limitations
Primates use a threecone trichromatic system resulting in full color vision
The color we perceive is a result of the ratio of activity of our three types of cones The colors of the visual
spectrum running from longwavelength light to short are red 700 nm orange 600 nm yellow 565 nm
green 497 nm blue 470 nm indigo 450 nm and violet 425 nm Humans have very sensitive perception of
color and can distinguish about 500 levels of brightness 200 different hues and 20 steps of saturation or about
2 million distinct colors
