KEY TERMS
technique used to separate DNA fragments according to size
during replication this enzyme helps to open up the DNA helix by breaking the hydrogen bonds
mutation that results from exposure to chemicals or environmental agents
during replication the strand that is replicated in short fragments and away from the replication
fork
strand that is synthesized continuously in the 53 direction which is synthesized in the direction
of the replication fork
enzyme that catalyzes the formation of a phosphodiester linkage between the 3 OH and 5 phosphate
ends of the DNA
type of repair mechanism in which mismatched bases are removed after replication
variation in the nucleotide sequence of a genome
type of DNA repair mechanism in which the wrong base along with a few
nucleotides upstream or downstream are removed
DNA fragment that is synthesized in short stretches on the lagging strand
mutation that affects a single base
enzyme that synthesizes the RNA primer the primer is needed for DNA pol to start synthesis of a new
DNA strand
short stretch of nucleotides that is required to initiate replication in the case of replication the primer has
RNA nucleotides
function of DNA pol in which it reads the newly added base before adding the next one
Yshaped structure formed during initiation of replication
mutation that is not expressed
during replication protein that binds to the singlestranded DNA this helps in
keeping the two strands of DNA apart so that they may serve as templates
ringshaped protein that holds the DNA pol on the DNA strand
mutation that takes place in the cells as a result of chemical reactions taking place
naturally without exposure to any external agent
enzyme that contains a catalytic part and an inbuilt RNA template it functions to maintain telomeres
at chromosome ends
DNA at the end of linear chromosomes
enzyme that causes underwinding or overwinding of DNA when DNA replication is taking place
process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell
when a purine is replaced with a purine or a pyrimidine is replaced with another
pyrimidine
when a purine is replaced by a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine is replaced by a purine
