a single ligand binds to a single receptor However activation of a receptorlinked enzyme can activate many
copies of a component of the signaling cascade which amplifies the signal

Methods of Intracellular Signaling
The induction of a signaling pathway depends on the modification of a cellular component by an enzyme There
are numerous enzymatic modifications that can occur and they are recognized in turn by the next component
downstream The following are some of the more common events in intracellular signaling
Phosphorylation
One of the most common chemical modifications that occurs in signaling pathways is the addition of a phosphate
group PO43 to a molecule such as a protein in a process called phosphorylation The phosphate can be
added to a nucleotide such as GMP to form GDP or GTP Phosphates are also often added to serine threonine
and tyrosine residues of proteins where they replace the hydroxyl group of the amino acid Figure 911
The transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an enzyme called a kinase Various kinases are named for
the substrate they phosphorylate Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues often activates enzymes
Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues can either affect the activity of an enzyme or create a binding site that
interacts with downstream components in the signaling cascade Phosphorylation may activate or inactivate
enzymes and the reversal of phosphorylation dephosphorylation by a phosphatase will reverse the effect
Figure 911 In protein phosphorylation a phosphate group PO43 is added to residues of the amino acids serine
threonine and tyrosine
Second Messengers
Second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the
signaling molecule to the receptor These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering
the behavior of certain cellular proteins
Calcium ion is a widely used second messenger The free concentration of calcium ions Ca2 within a
