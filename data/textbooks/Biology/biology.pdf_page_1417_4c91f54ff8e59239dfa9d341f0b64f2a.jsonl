harvested from the Little Calumet River in Illinois in May 2010 using rotenone a toxin often used as an insecticide in
an effort to learn more about the population of the species credit main image modification of work by USGS credit

Introduction
Imagine sailing down a river in a small motorboat on a weekend afternoon the water is smooth and you are
enjoying the warm sunshine and cool breeze when suddenly you are hit in the head by a 20pound silver carp
This is now a risk on many rivers and canal systems in Illinois and Missouri because of the presence of Asian
carp
This fishactually a group of species including the silver black grass and big head carphas been farmed
and eaten in China for over 1000 years It is one of the most important aquaculture food resources worldwide
In the United States however Asian carp is considered a dangerous invasive species that disrupts community
structure and composition to the point of threatening native species
