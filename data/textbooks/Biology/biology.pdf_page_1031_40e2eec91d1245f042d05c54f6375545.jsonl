invaders aiding in the removal of bacteria that has entered the body Another leukocyte that is found in the
peripheral blood is the monocyte Monocytes give rise to phagocytic macrophages that clean up dead and
damaged cells in the body whether they are foreign or from the host animal Two additional leukocytes in the
blood are eosinophils and basophilsboth help to facilitate the inflammatory response
The slightly granular material among the cells is a cytoplasmic fragment of a cell in the bone marrow This is
called a platelet or thrombocyte Platelets participate in the stages leading up to coagulation of the blood to stop
bleeding through damaged blood vessels Blood has a number of functions but primarily it transports material
through the body to bring nutrients to cells and remove waste material from them
Muscle Tissues
There are three types of muscle in animal bodies smooth skeletal and cardiac They differ by the presence or
absence of striations or bands the number and location of nuclei whether they are voluntarily or involuntarily
controlled and their location within the body Table 334 summarizes these differences

Smooth Muscle
Smooth muscle does not have striations in its cells It has a single centrally located nucleus as shown in Figure
3318 Constriction of smooth muscle occurs under involuntary autonomic nervous control and in response
to local conditions in the tissues Smooth muscle tissue is also called nonstriated as it lacks the banded
appearance of skeletal and cardiac muscle The walls of blood vessels the tubes of the digestive system and
the tubes of the reproductive systems are composed of mostly smooth muscle
Figure 3318 Smooth muscle cells do not have striations while skeletal muscle cells do Cardiac muscle cells have
striations but unlike the multinucleate skeletal cells they have only one nucleus Cardiac muscle tissue also has
intercalated discs specialized regions running along the plasma membrane that join adjacent cardiac muscle cells and
assist in passing an electrical impulse from cell to cell
Skeletal Muscle
Skeletal muscle has striations across its cells caused by the arrangement of the contractile proteins actin and
myosin These muscle cells are relatively long and have multiple nuclei along the edge of the cell Skeletal
muscle is under voluntary somatic nervous system control and is found in the muscles that move bones Figure
3318 illustrates the histology of skeletal muscle
Cardiac Muscle
Cardiac muscle shown in Figure 3318 is found only in the heart Like skeletal muscle it has cross striations
in its cells but cardiac muscle has a single centrally located nucleus Cardiac muscle is not under voluntary
control but can be influenced by the autonomic nervous system to speed up or slow down An added feature to
cardiac muscle cells is a line than extends along the end of the cell as it abuts the next cardiac cell in the row
This line is called an intercalated disc it assists in passing electrical impulse efficiently from one cell to the next
and maintains the strong connection between neighboring cardiac cells
