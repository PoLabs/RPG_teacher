of the key distinguishing features of lipidderived hormones is that they can diffuse across plasma membranes
whereas the amino acidderived and peptide hormones cannot
LipidDerived Hormones or Lipidsoluble Hormones
Most lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it as illustrated in Figure
372 The primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones Chemically these hormones are
usually ketones or alcohols their chemical names will end in ol for alcohols or one for ketones Examples of
steroid hormones include estradiol which is an estrogen or female sex hormone and testosterone which is an
androgen or male sex hormone These two hormones are released by the female and male reproductive organs
respectively Other steroid hormones include aldosterone and cortisol which are released by the adrenal glands
along with some other types of androgens Steroid hormones are insoluble in water and they are transported by
transport proteins in blood As a result they remain in circulation longer than peptide hormones For example
cortisol has a halflife of 60 to 90 minutes while epinephrine an amino acid derivedhormone has a halflife of
approximately one minute
Figure 372 The structures shown here represent a cholesterol plus the steroid hormones b testosterone and c
estradiol
Amino AcidDerived Hormones
The amino acidderived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids
tyrosine and tryptophan shown in Figure 373 If a hormone is amino acidderived its chemical name will
end in ine Examples of amino acidderived hormones include epinephrine and norepinephrine which are
synthesized in the medulla of the adrenal glands and thyroxine which is produced by the thyroid gland The
pineal gland in the brain makes and secretes melatonin which regulates sleep cycles
