replacement surgery in the hips and knees being the most common Replacement joints for shoulders elbows
and fingers are also available Even with this progress there is still room for improvement in the design of
prostheses The stateoftheart prostheses have limited durability and therefore wear out quickly particularly in
young or active individuals Current research is focused on the use of new materials such as carbon fiber that
may make prostheses more durable
381  Types of Skeletal Systems
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the different types of skeletal systems

Explain the role of the human skeletal system

Compare and contrast different skeletal systems
A skeletal system is necessary to support the body protect internal organs and allow for the movement
of an organism There are three different skeleton designs that fulfill these functions hydrostatic skeleton
exoskeleton and endoskeleton
Hydrostatic Skeleton
A hydrostatic skeleton is a skeleton formed by a fluidfilled compartment within the body called the coelom
The organs of the coelom are supported by the aqueous fluid which also resists external compression This
compartment is under hydrostatic pressure because of the fluid and supports the other organs of the organism
This type of skeletal system is found in softbodied animals such as sea anemones earthworms Cnidaria and
other invertebrates Figure 382

Movement in a hydrostatic skeleton is provided by muscles that surround the coelom The muscles in a
hydrostatic skeleton contract to change the shape of the coelom the pressure of the fluid in the coelom produces
movement For example earthworms move by waves of muscular contractions of the skeletal muscle of the
body wall hydrostatic skeleton called peristalsis which alternately shorten and lengthen the body Lengthening
the body extends the anterior end of the organism Most organisms have a mechanism to fix themselves in the
substrate Shortening the muscles then draws the posterior portion of the body forward Although a hydrostatic
skeleton is wellsuited to invertebrate organisms such as earthworms and some aquatic organisms it is not an
efficient skeleton for terrestrial animals
Exoskeleton
An exoskeleton is an external skeleton that consists of a hard encasement on the surface of an organism For
example the shells of crabs and insects are exoskeletons Figure 383 This skeleton type provides defence
against predators supports the body and allows for movement through the contraction of attached muscles
As with vertebrates muscles must cross a joint inside the exoskeleton Shortening of the muscle changes the
relationship of the two segments of the exoskeleton Arthropods such as crabs and lobsters have exoskeletons
