Figure 278 Bilateral symmetry The bilaterally symmetrical human body can be divided by several planes
Animals in the phylum Echinodermata such as sea stars sand dollars and sea urchins display modified radial
symmetry as adults but as we have noted their larval stages such as the bipinnaria initially exhibit bilateral
symmetry until they metamorphose in animals with radial symmetry this is termed secondary radial symmetry
Echinoderms evolved from bilaterally symmetrical animals thus they are classified as bilaterally symmetrical

Animal Characterization Based on Features of Embryological
Development
Most animal species undergo a separation of tissues into germ layers during embryonic development Recall
that these germ layers are formed during gastrulation and that each germ layer typically gives rise to specific
types of embryonic tissues and organs Animals develop either two or three embryonic germ layers Figure
279 The animals that display radial biradial or rotational symmetry develop two germ layers an inner layer
endoderm or mesendoderm and an outer layer ectoderm These animals are called diploblasts and have a
nonliving middle layer between the endoderm and ectoderm although individual cells may be distributed through
this middle layer there is no coherent third layer of tissue The four clades considered to be diploblastic have
different levels of complexity and different developmental pathways although there is little information about
development in Placozoa More complex animals usually those with bilateral symmetry develop three tissue
layers an inner layer endoderm an outer layer ectoderm and a middle layer mesoderm Animals with three
tissue layers are called triploblasts
