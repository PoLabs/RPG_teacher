Avian Respiration
Birds have evolved a respiratory system that enables them to fly Flying is a highenergy process and
requires a lot of oxygen Furthermore many birds fly in high altitudes where the concentration of oxygen is
low How did birds evolve a respiratory system that is so unique
Decades of research by paleontologists have shown that birds evolved from therapods meateating
dinosaurs Figure 3914 In fact fossil evidence shows that meateating dinosaurs that lived more than 100
million years ago had a similar flowthrough respiratory system with lungs and air sacs Archaeopteryx and
Xiaotingia for example were flying dinosaurs and are believed to be early precursors of birds
Figure 3914 Dinosaurs from which birds descended have similar hollow bones and are believed to have had a
similar respiratory system credit b modification of work by Zina Deretsky National Science Foundation
Most of us consider that dinosaurs are extinct However modern birds are descendants of avian dinosaurs
The respiratory system of modern birds has been evolving for hundreds of millions of years
All mammals have lungs that are the main organs for breathing Lung capacity has evolved to support the
animals activities During inhalation the lungs expand with air and oxygen diffuses across the lungs surface
and enters the bloodstream During exhalation the lungs expel air and lung volume decreases In the next few
sections the process of human breathing will be explained
The Mechanics of Human Breathing
Boyles Law is the gas law that states that in a closed space pressure and volume are inversely related As
volume decreases pressure increases and vice versa Figure 3915 The relationship between gas pressure
and volume helps to explain the mechanics of breathing
