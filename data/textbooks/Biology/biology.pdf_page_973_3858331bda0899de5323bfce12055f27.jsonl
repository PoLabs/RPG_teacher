nutrient depletion zone Hyphae can grow into small soil pores that allow access to phosphorus that would
otherwise be unavailable to the plant The beneficial effect on the plant is best observed in poor soils The benefit
to fungi is that they can obtain up to 20 percent of the total carbon accessed by plants Mycorrhizae functions
as a physical barrier to pathogens It also provides an induction of generalized host defense mechanisms and
sometimes involves production of antibiotic compounds by the fungi

There are two types of mycorrhizae ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae Ectomycorrhizae form an extensive
dense sheath around the roots called a mantle Hyphae from the fungi extend from the mantle into the soil
which increases the surface area for water and mineral absorption This type of mycorrhizae is found in forest
trees especially conifers birches and oaks Endomycorrhizae also called arbuscular mycorrhizae do not form
a dense sheath over the root Instead the fungal mycelium is embedded within the root tissue Endomycorrhizae
are found in the roots of more than 80 percent of terrestrial plants
Nutrients from Other Sources
Some plants cannot produce their own food and must obtain their nutrition from outside sources This may occur
with plants that are parasitic or saprophytic Some plants are mutualistic symbionts epiphytes or insectivorous
Plant Parasites
A parasitic plant depends on its host for survival Some parasitic plants have no leaves An example of this
is the dodder Figure 3113 which has a weak cylindrical stem that coils around the host and forms suckers
From these suckers cells invade the host stem and grow to connect with the vascular bundles of the host
The parasitic plant obtains water and nutrients through these connections The plant is a total parasite a
holoparasite because it is completely dependent on its host Other parasitic plants hemiparasites are fully
photosynthetic and only use the host for water and minerals There are about 4100 species of parasitic plants
