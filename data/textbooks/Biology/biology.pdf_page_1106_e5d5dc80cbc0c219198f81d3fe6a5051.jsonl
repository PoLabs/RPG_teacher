355  Nervous System Disorders
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the symptoms potential causes and treatment of several examples of nervous system
disorders
A nervous system that functions correctly is a fantastically complex welloiled machinesynapses fire
appropriately muscles move when needed memories are formed and stored and emotions are well regulated
Unfortunately each year millions of people in the United States deal with some sort of nervous system disorder
While scientists have discovered potential causes of many of these diseases and viable treatments for some
ongoing research seeks to find ways to better prevent and treat all of these disorders
Neurodegenerative Disorders
Neurodegenerative disorders are illnesses characterized by a loss of nervous system functioning that are
usually caused by neuronal death These diseases generally worsen over time as more and more neurons
die The symptoms of a particular neurodegenerative disease are related to where in the nervous system
the death of neurons occurs Spinocerebellar ataxia for example leads to neuronal death in the cerebellum
The death of these neurons causes problems in balance and walking Neurodegenerative disorders include
Huntingtons disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Alzheimers disease and other types of dementia disorders
and Parkinsons disease Here Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease will be discussed in more depth
Alzheimers Disease
Alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly In 2012 an estimated 54 million
Americans suffered from Alzheimers disease and payments for their care are estimated at 200 billion Roughly
one in every eight people age 65 or older has the disease Due to the aging of the babyboomer generation
there are projected to be as many as 13 million Alzheimers patients in the United States in the year 2050
Symptoms of Alzheimers disease include disruptive memory loss confusion about time or place difficulty
planning or executing tasks poor judgment and personality changes Problems smelling certain scents can also
be indicative of Alzheimers disease and may serve as an early warning sign Many of these symptoms are also
common in people who are aging normally so it is the severity and longevity of the symptoms that determine
whether a person is suffering from Alzheimers
Alzheimers disease was named for Alois Alzheimer a German psychiatrist who published a report in 1911
about a woman who showed severe dementia symptoms Along with his colleagues he examined the womans
brain following her death and reported the presence of abnormal clumps which are now called amyloid plaques
along with tangled brain fibers called neurofibrillary tangles Amyloid plaques neurofibrillary tangles and an
overall shrinking of brain volume are commonly seen in the brains of Alzheimers patients Loss of neurons in
the hippocampus is especially severe in advanced Alzheimers patients Figure 3530 compares a normal brain
to the brain of an Alzheimers patient Many research groups are examining the causes of these hallmarks of the
disease
One form of the disease is usually caused by mutations in one of three known genes This rare form of early
onset Alzheimers disease affects fewer than five percent of patients with the disease and causes dementia
beginning between the ages of 30 and 60 The more prevalent lateonset form of the disease likely also has a
genetic component One particular gene apolipoprotein E APOE has a variant E4 that increases a carriers
likelihood of getting the disease Many other genes have been identified that might be involved in the pathology
