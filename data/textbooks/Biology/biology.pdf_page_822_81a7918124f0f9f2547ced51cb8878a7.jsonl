this is greatly reduced in the class Cephalopoda which contains the octopuses and squids
Figure 2821 Molluscan body regions There are many species and variations of molluscs this illustration
shows the anatomy of an aquatic gastropod In a terrestrial gastropod the mantle cavity itself would serve as a
respiratory organ
Which of the following statements about the anatomy of a mollusc is false
1
Most molluscs have a radula for grinding food
2
A digestive gland is connected to the stomach
3
The tissue beneath the shell is called the mantle
4
The digestive system includes a gizzard a stomach a digestive gland and the intestine
The muscular foot is the ventralmost organ whereas the mantle is the limiting dorsal organ that folds over the
visceral mass The foot which is used for locomotion and anchorage varies in shape and function depending
on the type of mollusk under study In shelled mollusks the foot is usually the same size as the opening of the
shell The foot is both retractable and extendable In the class Cephalopoda headfoot the foot takes the form
of a funnel for expelling water at high velocity from the mantle cavity and the anterior margin of the foot has
been modified into a circle of arms and tentacles
The visceral mass is present above the foot in the visceral hump This mass contains digestive nervous
excretory reproductive and respiratory systems Molluscan species that are exclusively aquatic have gills that
extend into the mantle cavity whereas some terrestrial species have lungs formed from the lining of the mantle
cavity Mollusks are schizocoelous eucoelomates but the coelomic cavity in adult animals has been largely
reduced to a cavity around the heart However a reduced coelom sometimes surrounds the gonads part of the
kidneys and intestine as well This overall coelomic reduction makes the mantle cavity the major internal body
chamber
Most mollusks have a special rasplike organ the radula which bears chitinous filelike teeth The radula is
present in all groups except the bivalves and serves to shred or scrape food before it enters the digestive
tract The mantle also known as the pallium is the dorsal epidermis in mollusks all mollusks except some
cephalopods are specialized to secrete a calcareous shell that protects the animals soft body
Most mollusks are dioecious animals and fertilization occurs externally although this is not the case in terrestrial
mollusks such as snails and slugs or in cephalopods In most aquatic mollusks the zygote hatches and
produces a trochophore larva with several bands of cilia around a toplike body and an additional apical tuft
of cilia In some species the trochophore may be followed by additional larval stages such as a veliger larvae
before the final metamorphosis to the adult form Most cephalopods develop directly into small versions of their
adult form
Classification of Phylum Mollusca
Phylum Mollusca comprises a very diverse group of organisms that exhibits a dramatic variety of forms ranging
from chitons to snails to squids the latter of which typically show a high degree of intelligence This variability is a
consequence of modification of the basic body regions especially the foot and mantle The phylum is organized
into eight classes Caudofoveata Solenogastres Monoplacophora Polyplacophora Gastropoda Cephalopoda
