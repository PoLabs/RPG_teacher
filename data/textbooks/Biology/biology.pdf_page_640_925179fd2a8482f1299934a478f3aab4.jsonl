Caulerpa which can have single cells that can be several meters in size Some protists are multicellular such as
the red green and brown seaweeds It is among the protists that one finds the wealth of ways that organisms
can grow
231  Eukaryotic Origins
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

List the unifying characteristics of eukaryotes

Describe what scientists know about the origins of eukaryotes based on the last common ancestor

Explain the endosymbiotic theory
Organisms are classified into three domains Archaea Bacteria and Eukarya The first two lineages comprise all
prokaryotic cells and the third contains all eukaryotes A very sparse fossil record prevents us from determining
what the first members of each of these lineages looked like so it is possible that all the events that led to the
last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes will remain unknown However comparative biology of extant living
organisms and the limited fossil record provide some insight into the evolution of Eukarya
The earliest fossils found appear to be those of domain Bacteria most likely cyanobacteria They are about 35
to 38 billion years old and are recognizable because of their relatively complex structure and for prokaryotes
relatively large cells Most other prokaryotes have small cells 1 or 2 m in size and would be difficult to pick
out as fossils Fossil stromatolites suggest that at least some prokaryotes lived in interactive communities and
evidence from the structure of living eukaryotic cells suggests that it was similar ancestral interactions that gave
rise to the eukaryotes Most living eukaryotes have cells measuring 10 m or greater Structures this size which
might be fossilized remains of early eukaryotes appear in the geological record in deposits dating to about 21
billion years ago
Characteristics of Eukaryotes
Data from these fossils as well as from the study of living genomes have led comparative biologists to conclude
that living eukaryotes are all descendants of a single common ancestor Mapping the characteristics found in all
major groups of eukaryotes reveals that the following characteristics are present in at least some of the members
of each major lineage or during some part of their life cycle and therefore must have been present in the last
common ancestor
1
Cells with nuclei surrounded by a nuclear envelope with nuclear pores This is the single characteristic
that is both necessary and sufficient to define an organism as a eukaryote All extant eukaryotes have cells
with nuclei
2
Mitochondria Most extant eukaryotes have typical mitochondria although some eukaryotes have very
reduced mitochondrial remnants and a few lack detectable mitochondria
3
Cytoskeleton of microtubules and microfilaments Eukaryotic cells possess the structural and motility
components called actin microfilaments and microtubules All extant eukaryotes have these cytoskeletal
elements
4
Flagella and cilia Organelles associated with cell motility Some extant eukaryotes lack flagella and
or cilia but their presence in related lineages suggests that they are descended from ancestors that
possessed these organelles
5
Chromosomes organized by histones Each eukaryotic chromosome consists of a linear DNA molecule
coiled around basic alkaline proteins called histones The few eukaryotes with chromosomes lacking
histones clearly evolved from ancestors that had them
6
Mitosis A process of nuclear division in which replicated chromosomes are divided and separated using
elements of the cytoskeleton Mitosis is universally present in eukaryotes
7
Sexual reproduction A meiotic process of nuclear division and genetic recombination unique to
eukaryotes During this process diploid nuclei at one stage of the life cycle undergo meiosis to yield haploid
nuclei which subsequently fuse together karyogamy to create a diploid zygote nucleus
8
Cell walls It might be reasonable to conclude that the last common ancestor could make cell walls during
