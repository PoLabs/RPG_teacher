163  Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how chromatin remodeling controls transcriptional access

Describe how access to DNA is controlled by histone modification

Describe how DNA methylation is related to epigenetic gene changes
Eukaryotic gene expression is more complex than prokaryotic gene expression because the processes of
transcription and translation are physically separated Unlike prokaryotic cells eukaryotic cells can regulate gene
expression at many different levels Epigenetic changes are inheritable changes in gene expression that do not
result from changes in the DNA sequence Eukaryotic gene expression begins with control of access to the
DNA Transcriptional access to the DNA can be controlled in two general ways chromatin remodeling and DNA
methylation Chromatin remodeling changes the way that DNA is associated with chromosomal histones DNA
methylation is associated with developmental changes and gene silencing
Epigenetic Control Regulating Access to Genes within the
Chromosome
The human genome encodes over 20000 genes with hundreds to thousands of genes on each of the 23 human
chromosomes The DNA in the nucleus is precisely wound folded and compacted into chromosomes so that it
will fit into the nucleus It is also organized so that specific segments can be accessed as needed by a specific
cell type
The first level of organization or packing is the winding of DNA strands around histone proteins Histones
package and order DNA into structural units called nucleosome complexes which can control the access of
proteins to the DNA regions Figure 166a Under the electron microscope this winding of DNA around histone
proteins to form nucleosomes looks like small beads on a string Figure 166b
