Figure 131 Chromosomes are threadlike nuclear structures consisting of DNA and proteins that serve as the
repositories for genetic information The chromosomes depicted here were isolated from a fruit flys salivary gland
stained with dye and visualized under a microscope Akin to miniature bar codes chromosomes absorb different dyes
to produce characteristic banding patterns which allows for their routine identification credit modification of work by

Introduction
The gene is the physical unit of inheritance and genes are arranged in a linear order on chromosomes
Chromosome behavior and interaction during meiosis explain at a cellular level inheritance patterns that we
observe in populations Genetic disorders involving alterations in chromosome number or structure may have
dramatic effects and can prevent a fertilized egg from developing
