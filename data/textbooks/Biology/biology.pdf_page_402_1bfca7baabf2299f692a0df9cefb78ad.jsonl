144  DNA Replication in Prokaryotes
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain the process of DNA replication in prokaryotes

Discuss the role of different enzymes and proteins in supporting this process
DNA replication has been well studied in prokaryotes primarily because of the small size of the genome
and because of the large variety of mutants that are available E coli has 46 million base pairs in a single
circular chromosome and all of it gets replicated in approximately 42 minutes starting from a single site along
the chromosome and proceeding around the circle in both directions This means that approximately 1000
nucleotides are added per second Thus the process is quite rapid and occurs without many mistakes
DNA replication employs a large number of structural proteins and enzymes each of which plays a critical role
during the process One of the key players is the enzyme DNA polymerase also known as DNA pol which adds
nucleotides onebyone to the growing DNA chain that is complementary to the template strand The addition
of nucleotides requires energy this energy is obtained from the nucleoside triphosphates ATP GTP TTP and
CTP Like ATP the other NTPs nucleoside triphosphates are highenergy molecules that can serve both as
the source of DNA nucleotides and the source of energy to drive the polymerization When the bond between
the phosphates is broken the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester bond between the incoming
nucleotide and the growing chain In prokaryotes three main types of polymerases are known DNA pol I DNA
pol II and DNA pol III It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis DNA pol I is
an important accessory enzyme in DNA replication and along with DNA pol II is primarily required for repair
How does the replication machinery know where to begin It turns out that there are specific nucleotide
sequences called origins of replication where replication begins In E coli which has a single origin of replication
on its one chromosome as do most prokaryotes this origin of replication is approximately 245 base pairs long
and is rich in AT sequences The origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site An
enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs
ATP hydrolysis is required for this process As the DNA opens up Yshaped structures called replication forks
are formed Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bidirectionally as
replication proceeds Singlestrand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the replication fork
to prevent the singlestranded DNA from winding back into a double helix
DNA polymerase has two important restrictions it is able to add nucleotides only in the 5 to 3 direction a
new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction It also requires a free 3OH group to which it can
add nucleotides by forming a phosphodiester bond between the 3OH end and the 5 phosphate of the next
nucleotide This essentially means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3OH group is not available Then how
does it add the first nucleotide The problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3OH
end Another enzyme RNA primase synthesizes an RNA segment that is about five to ten nucleotides long
and complementary to the template DNA Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis it is appropriately
called the primer DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer adding nucleotides onebyone that are
complementary to the template strand Figure 1414
