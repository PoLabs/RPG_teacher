Branches of Biological Study
The scope of biology is broad and therefore contains many branches and subdisciplines Biologists may
pursue one of those subdisciplines and work in a more focused field For instance molecular biology and
biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level including interactions among
molecules such as DNA RNA and proteins as well as the way they are regulated Microbiology the study of
microorganisms is the study of the structure and function of singlecelled organisms It is quite a broad branch
itself and depending on the subject of study there are also microbial physiologists ecologists and geneticists
among others
Forensic Scientist
Forensic science is the application of science to answer questions related to the law Biologists as well
as chemists and biochemists can be forensic scientists Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for
use in courts and their job involves examining trace materials associated with crimes Interest in forensic
science has increased in the last few years possibly because of popular television shows that feature
forensic scientists on the job Also developing molecular techniques and establishing DNA databases have
expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do Their job activities are primarily related to crimes
against people such as murder rape and assault Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair
blood and other body fluids and also processing DNA Figure 119 found in many different environments
and materials Forensic scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes such as insect
larvae or pollen grains Students who want to pursue careers in forensic science will most likely have to take
chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math courses

Another field of biological study neurobiology studies the biology of the nervous system and although it
is a branch of biology it is also an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience Because of its
interdisciplinary nature this subdiscipline studies different nervous system functions using molecular cellular
developmental medical and computational approaches
