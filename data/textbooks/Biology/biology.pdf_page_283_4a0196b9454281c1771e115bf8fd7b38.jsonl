KEY TERMS
programmed cell death
signal that is sent and received by the same or similar nearby cells
signaling molecule secreted by bacteria to communicate with other bacteria of its kind
cellsurface protein that transmits a signal from the exterior of the cell to the interior even
though the ligand does not enter the cell
small space between axon terminals and dendrites of nerve cells where neurotransmitters
function
second messenger that is derived from ATP
also protein kinase A or PKA kinase that is activated by binding to cAMP
cleavage product of PIP2 that is used for signaling within the plasma membrane
chemical compound formed when two molecules join together
of receptor proteins interaction of two receptor proteins to form a functional complex called a
dimer
cell that releases ligands involved in endocrine signaling hormones
longdistance signal that is delivered by ligands hormones traveling through an organisms
circulatory system from the signaling cell to the target cell
cellsurface receptor with intracellular domains that are associated with membrane
bound enzymes
region of a cellsurface receptor that is located on the cell surface
cellsurface receptor that activates membranebound Gproteins to transmit a signal
from the receptor to nearby membrane components
ligand that binds to cellsurface receptors and stimulates cell growth
molecule that binds to a protein usually an enzyme and keeps it from functioning
lipid present at small concentrations in the plasma membrane that is converted into a
second messenger it has inositol a carbohydrate as its hydrophilic head group
cleavage product of PIP2 that is used for signaling within the cell
communication between a cell
also intracellular receptor receptor protein that is located in the cytosol of a cell and binds to
ligands that pass through the plasma membrane
also second messenger small molecule that transmits signals within a cell
communication within cells
cellsurface receptor that forms a plasma membrane channel which opens when
a ligand binds to the extracellular domain ligandgated channels
enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to another molecule
molecule produced by a signaling cell that binds with a specific receptor delivering a signal in the
process
