Mature rRNAs make up approximately 50 percent of each ribosome Some of a ribosomes RNA molecules are
purely structural whereas others have catalytic or binding activities Mature tRNAs take on a threedimensional
structure through local regions of base pairing stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding The tRNA folds
to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end Figure 1514 The
anticodon is a threenucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an mRNA codon through complementary
base pairing
Figure 1514 This is a spacefilling model of a tRNA molecule that adds the amino acid phenylalanine to a growing
polypeptide chain The anticodon AAG binds the Codon UUC on the mRNA The amino acid phenylalanine is attached
to the other end of the tRNA
155  Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the different steps in protein synthesis

Discuss the role of ribosomes in protein synthesis
The synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cells energy than any other metabolic process In turn proteins
account for more mass than any other component of living organisms with the exception of water and proteins
perform virtually every function of a cell The process of translation or protein synthesis involves the decoding of
an mRNA message into a polypeptide product Amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide
bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 to more than 1000 amino acid residues Each individual amino
acid has an amino group NH2 and a carboxyl COOH group Polypeptides are formed when the amino group
of one amino acid forms an amide ie peptide bond with the carboxyl group of another amino acid Figure
1515 This reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates one water molecule
