classified as either alternate spiral or opposite Plants that have only one leaf per node have leaves that are
said to be either alternatemeaning the leaves alternate on each side of the stem in a flat planeor spiral
meaning the leaves are arrayed in a spiral along the stem In an opposite leaf arrangement two leaves arise
at the same point with the leaves connecting opposite each other along the branch If there are three or more
leaves connected at a node the leaf arrangement is classified as whorled
Leaf Form
Leaves may be simple or compound Figure 3023 In a simple leaf the blade is either completely
undividedas in the banana leafor it has lobes but the separation does not reach the midrib as in the maple
leaf In a compound leaf the leaf blade is completely divided forming leaflets as in the locust tree Each leaflet
may have its own stalk but is attached to the rachis A palmately compound leaf resembles the palm of a
hand with leaflets radiating outwards from one point Examples include the leaves of poison ivy the buckeye
tree or the familiar houseplant Schefflera sp common name umbrella plant Pinnately compound leaves
take their name from their featherlike appearance the leaflets are arranged along the midrib as in rose leaves
Rosa sp or the leaves of hickory pecan ash or walnut trees
Figure 3023 Leaves may be simple or compound In simple leaves the lamina is continuous The a banana plant
Musa sp has simple leaves In compound leaves the lamina is separated into leaflets Compound leaves may be
palmate or pinnate In b palmately compound leaves such as those of the horse chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum
the leaflets branch from the petiole In c pinnately compound leaves the leaflets branch from the midrib as on a scrub
hickory Carya floridana The d honey locust has double compound leaves in which leaflets branch from the veins

Leaf Structure and Function
The outermost layer of the leaf is the epidermis it is present on both sides of the leaf and is called the upper
and lower epidermis respectively Botanists call the upper side the adaxial surface or adaxis and the lower
side the abaxial surface or abaxis The epidermis helps in the regulation of gas exchange It contains stomata
Figure 3024 openings through which the exchange of gases takes place Two guard cells surround each
stoma regulating its opening and closing
