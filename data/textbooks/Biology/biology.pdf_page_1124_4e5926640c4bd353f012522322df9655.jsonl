Analyze the datareport the results What step weight did all participants find to be equal with onepound
base weight What about the 20pound group
Draw a conclusion Did the data support the hypothesis Are the final weights proportionally the same
If not why not Do the findings adhere to Webers Law Webers Law states that the concept that a just
noticeable difference in a stimulus is proportional to the magnitude of the original stimulus
362  Somatosensation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe four important mechanoreceptors in human skin

Describe the topographical distribution of somatosensory receptors between glabrous and hairy skin

Explain why the perception of pain is subjective
Somatosensation is a mixed sensory category and includes all sensation received from the skin and mucous
membranes as well from as the limbs and joints Somatosensation is also known as tactile sense or more
familiarly as the sense of touch Somatosensation occurs all over the exterior of the body and at some interior
locations as well A variety of receptor typesembedded in the skin mucous membranes muscles joints
internal organs and cardiovascular systemplay a role
Recall that the epidermis is the outermost layer of skin in mammals It is relatively thin is composed of keratin
filled cells and has no blood supply The epidermis serves as a barrier to water and to invasion by pathogens
Below this the much thicker dermis contains blood vessels sweat glands hair follicles lymph vessels and
lipidsecreting sebaceous glands Figure 364 Below the epidermis and dermis is the subcutaneous tissue or
hypodermis the fatty layer that contains blood vessels connective tissue and the axons of sensory neurons
The hypodermis which holds about 50 percent of the bodys fat attaches the dermis to the bone and muscle
and supplies nerves and blood vessels to the dermis
