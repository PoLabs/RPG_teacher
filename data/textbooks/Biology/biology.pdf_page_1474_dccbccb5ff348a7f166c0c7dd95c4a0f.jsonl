Two general types of food webs are often shown interacting within a single ecosystem A grazing food web
such as the Lake Ontario food web in Figure 466 has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base
followed by herbivores and various carnivores A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed
on decaying organic matter dead organisms called decomposers or detritivores These organisms are usually
bacteria or fungi that recycle organic material back into the biotic part of the ecosystem as they themselves are
consumed by other organisms As all ecosystems require a method to recycle material from dead organisms
most grazing food webs have an associated detrital food web For example in a meadow ecosystem plants may
support a grazing food web of different organisms primary and other levels of consumers while at the same
time supporting a detrital food web of bacteria fungi and detrivorous invertebrates feeding off dead plants and
animals
