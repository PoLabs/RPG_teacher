Figure 4219 The polio vaccine can be administered orally credit modification of work by UNICEF Sverige
Currently a version of intranasal influenza vaccine is available and the polio and typhoid vaccines can
be administered orally as shown in Figure 4219 Similarly the measles and rubella vaccines are being
adapted to aerosol delivery using inhalation devices Eventually transgenic plants may be engineered to
produce vaccine antigens that can be eaten to confer disease resistance Other vaccines may be adapted
to rectal or vaginal application to elicit immune responses in rectal genitourinary or reproductive mucosa
Finally vaccine antigens may be adapted to transdermal application in which the skin is lightly scraped
and microneedles are used to pierce the outermost layer In addition to mobilizing the mucosal immune
response this new generation of vaccines may end the anxiety associated with injections and in turn
improve patient participation
Primary Centers of the Immune System
Although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body the regulation maturation
and intercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites The blood circulates immune cells proteins
and other factors through the body Approximately 01 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes which
encompass monocytes the precursor of macrophages and lymphocytes The majority of cells in the blood are
erythrocytes red blood cells Lymph is a watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood
cells and does not contain erythrocytes Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic
and blood circulatory systems which are separated by interstitial space by a process called extravasation
passing through to surrounding tissue
The cells of the immune system originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow Cytokines stimulate
these stem cells to differentiate into immune cells B cell maturation occurs in the bone marrow whereas nave
T cells transit from the bone marrow to the thymus for maturation In the thymus immature T cells that express
TCRs complementary to selfantigens are destroyed This process helps prevent autoimmune responses
On maturation T and B lymphocytes circulate to various destinations Lymph nodes scattered throughout the
body as illustrated in Figure 4220 house large populations of T and B cells dendritic cells and macrophages
Lymph gathers antigens as it drains from tissues These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before
the lymph is returned to circulation APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby
lymphocytes about potential pathogens
