46  Connections between Cells and Cellular Activities
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the extracellular matrix

List examples of the ways that plant cells and animal cells communicate with adjacent cells

Summarize the roles of tight junctions desmosomes gap junctions and plasmodesmata
You already know that tissue is a group of similar cells working together As you might expect if cells are to work
together they must communicate with each other just as you need to communicate with others if you work on a
group project Lets take a look at how cells communicate with each other
Extracellular Matrix of Animal Cells
While cells in most multicellular organisms release materials into the extracellular space animal cells will be
discussed as an example The primary components of these materials are proteins and the most abundant
protein is collagen Collagen fibers are interwoven with proteoglycans which are carbohydratecontaining
protein molecules Collectively we call these materials the extracellular matrix Figure 427 Not only does
the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue but it also allows the cells within the tissue to
communicate with each other How can this happen
