embryo with a radicle or small root and one monocot or two dicot leaflike organs called cotyledons This
difference in the number of embryonic leaves is the basis for the two major groups of angiosperms the monocots
and the eudicots Seed food reserves are stored outside the embryo in the form of complex carbohydrates
lipids or proteins The cotyledons serve as conduits to transmit the brokendown food reserves from their
storage site inside the seed to the developing embryo The seed consists of a toughened layer of integuments
forming the coat the endosperm with food reserves and at the center the wellprotected embryo
Most angiosperms have perfect flowers which means that each flower carries both stamens and carpels
Figure 2615 In monoecious plants male staminate and female pistillate flowers are separate but carried
on the same plant Sweetgums Liquidambar spp and beeches Betula spp are monoecious Figure 2616
In dioecious plants male and female flowers are found on separate plants Willows Salix spp and poplars
Populus spp are dioecious In spite of the predominance of perfect flowers only a few species of angiosperms
selfpollinate Both anatomical and environmental barriers promote crosspollination mediated by a physical
agent wind or water or an animal such as an insect or bird Crosspollination increases genetic diversity in a
species

Fruit
As the seed develops the walls of the ovary thicken and form the fruit The seed forms in an ovary which also
enlarges as the seeds grow Many foods commonly called vegetables are actually fruits Eggplants zucchini
string beans tomatoes and bell peppers are all technically fruits because they contain seeds and are derived
from the thick ovary tissue Acorns are true nuts and winged maple helicopter seeds or whirligigs whose
botanical name is samara are also fruits Botanists classify fruit into more than two dozen different categories
only a few of which are actually fleshy and sweet
Mature fruit can be fleshy or dry Fleshy fruit include the familiar berries peaches apples grapes and tomatoes
Rice wheat and nuts are examples of dry fruit Another subtle distinction is that not all fruits are derived from
