The Vertebral Column
The vertebral column or spinal column surrounds and protects the spinal cord supports the head and acts
as an attachment point for the ribs and muscles of the back and neck The adult vertebral column comprises 26
bones the 24 vertebrae the sacrum and the coccyx bones In the adult the sacrum is typically composed of
five vertebrae that fuse into one The coccyx is typically 34 vertebrae that fuse into one Around the age of 70
the sacrum and the coccyx may fuse together We begin life with approximately 33 vertebrae but as we grow
several vertebrae fuse together The adult vertebrae are further divided into the 7 cervical vertebrae 12 thoracic
