You may have used litmus or pH paper filter paper treated with a natural watersoluble dye for use as a pH
indicator tests how much acid acidity or base alkalinity exists in a solution You might have even used some
to test whether the water in a swimming pool is properly treated In both cases the pH test measures hydrogen
ions concentration in a given solution
Hydrogen ions spontaneously generate in pure water by the dissociation ionization of a small percentage of
water molecules into equal numbers of hydrogen H ions and hydroxide OH ions While the hydroxide ions
are kept in solution by their hydrogen bonding with other water molecules the hydrogen ions consisting of naked
protons immediately attract to unionized water molecules forming hydronium ions H30 Still by convention
scientists refer to hydrogen ions and their concentration as if they were free in this state in liquid water
The concentration of hydrogen ions dissociating from pure water is 1  107 moles H ions per liter of water
Moles mol are a way to express the amount of a substance which can be atoms molecules ions etc
One mole represents the atomic weight of a substance expressed in grams which equals the amount of the
substance containing as many units as there are atoms in 12 grams of 12C Mathematically one mole is equal
to 602  1023 particles of the substance Therefore 1 mole of water is equal to 602  1023 water molecules
We calculate the pH as the negative of the base 10 logarithm of this concentration The log10 of 1  107 is 70
and the negative of this number indicated by the p of pH yields a pH of 70 which is also a neutral pH The
pH inside of human cells and blood are examples of two body areas where nearneutral pH is maintained
Nonneutral pH readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water Using the negative logarithm to generate
positive integers high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number whereas low levels of hydrogen
ions result in a high pH An acid is a substance that increases hydrogen ions H concentration in a solution
usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate A base provides either hydroxide ions OH or other
negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions reducing their concentration in the solution and
thereby raising the pH In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions these ions bind to free hydrogen ions
generating new water molecules
The stronger the acid the more readily it donates H For example hydrochloric acid HCl completely
dissociates into hydrogen and chloride ions and is highly acidic whereas the acids in tomato juice or vinegar
do not completely dissociate and are weak acids Conversely strong bases are those substances that readily
donate OH or take up hydrogen ions Sodium hydroxide NaOH and many household cleaners are highly
alkaline and give up OH rapidly when we place them in water thereby raising the pH An example of a weak
basic solution is seawater which has a pH near 80 This is close enough to a neutral pH that marine organisms
have adapted in order to live and thrive in a saline environment
The pH scale is as we previously mentioned an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 Figure 219
Anything below 70 ranging from 00 to 69 is acidic and anything above 70 from 71 to 140 is alkaline
Extremes in pH in either direction from 70 are usually inhospitable to life The pH inside cells 68 and the pH in
54
