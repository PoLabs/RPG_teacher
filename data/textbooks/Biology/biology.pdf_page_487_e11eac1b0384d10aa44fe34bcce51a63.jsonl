dNTP which is a monomer or a single DNA unit The primer and dNTP mix with a small proportion of
fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides ddNTPs The ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl
group OH at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain Figure 1713 Scientists
label each ddNTP with a different color of fluorophore Every time a ddNTP incorporates in the growing
complementary strand it terminates the DNA replication process which results in multiple short strands of
replicated DNA that each terminate at a different point during replication When gel electrophoresis processes
the reaction mixture after separating into single strands the multiple newly replicated DNA strands form a ladder
because of the differing sizes Because the ddNTPs are fluorescently labeled each band on the gel reflects the
DNA strands size and the ddNTP that terminated the reaction The different colors of the fluorophorelabeled
ddNTPs help identify the ddNTP incorporated at that position Reading the gel on the basis of each bands color
on the ladder produces the template strands sequence Figure 1714
Figure 1713 A dideoxynucleotide is similar in structure to a deoxynucleotide but is missing the 3 hydroxyl group
indicated by the box When a dideoxynucleotide is incorporated into a DNA strand DNA synthesis stops
Figure 1714 This figure illustrates Frederick Sangers dideoxy chain termination method Using dideoxynucleotides
the DNA fragment can terminate at different points The DNA separates on the basis of size and we can read these
bands based on the fragments size
Early Strategies Shotgun Sequencing and PairWise End Sequencing
In shotgun sequencing method several DNA fragment copies cut randomly into many smaller pieces
somewhat like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun All of the segments
sequence using the chainsequencing method Then with sequence computer assistance scientists can
analyze the fragments to see where their sequences overlap By matching overlapping sequences at each
fragments end scientists can reform the entire DNA sequence A larger sequence that is assembled from
overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig As an analogy consider that someone has four copies of
a landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should appear The
person then rips up each photograph with their hands so that different size pieces are present from each copy
