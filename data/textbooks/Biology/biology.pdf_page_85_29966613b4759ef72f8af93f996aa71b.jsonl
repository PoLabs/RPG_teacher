Figure 37 Sucrose forms when a glucose monomer and a fructose monomer join in a dehydration reaction to form
a glycosidic bond In the process a water molecule is lost By convention the carbon atoms in a monosaccharide
are numbered from the terminal carbon closest to the carbonyl group In sucrose a glycosidic linkage forms between
carbon 1 in glucose and carbon 2 in fructose
Common disaccharides include lactose maltose and sucrose Figure 38 Lactose is a disaccharide consisting
of the monomers glucose and galactose It is naturally in milk Maltose or malt sugar is a disaccharide formed
by a dehydration reaction between two glucose molecules The most common disaccharide is sucrose or table
sugar which is comprised of glucose and fructose monomers
