Mycologist
Mycologists are biologists who study fungi Historically mycology was a branch of microbiology and
many mycologists start their careers with a degree in microbiology To become a mycologist a bachelors
degree in a biological science preferably majoring in microbiology and a masters degree in mycology are
minimally necessary Mycologists can specialize in taxonomy and fungal genomics molecular and cellular
biology plant pathology biotechnology or biochemistry Some medical microbiologists concentrate on the
study of infectious diseases caused by fungi called mycoses Mycologists collaborate with zoologists and
plant pathologists to identify and control difficult fungal infections such as the devastating chestnut blight
the mysterious decline in frog populations in many areas of the world or the deadly epidemic called white
nose syndrome which is decimating bats in the Eastern United States
Government agencies hire mycologists as research scientists and technicians to monitor the health of crops
national parks and national forests Mycologists are also employed in the private sector by companies
that develop chemical and biological control products or new agricultural products and by companies that
provide disease control services Because of the key role played by fungi in the fermentation of alcohol
and the preparation of many important foods scientists with a good understanding of fungal physiology
routinely work in the food technology industry Oenology the science of wine making relies not only on the
knowledge of grape varietals and soil composition but also on a solid understanding of the characteristics
of the wild yeasts that thrive in different winemaking regions It is possible to purchase yeast strains isolated
from specific grapegrowing regions The great French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur made
many of his essential discoveries working on the humble brewers yeast thus discovering the process of
fermentation
Cell Structure and Function
Fungi are eukaryotes and as such have a complex cellular organization As eukaryotes fungal cells contain
a membranebound nucleus The DNA in the nucleus is wrapped around histone proteins as is observed in
other eukaryotic cells A few types of fungi have accessory genomic structures comparable to bacterial plasmids
loops of DNA however the horizontal transfer of genetic information that occurs between one bacterium
and another rarely occurs in fungi Fungal cells also contain mitochondria and a complex system of internal
membranes including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus
Unlike plant cells fungal cells do not have chloroplasts or chlorophyll Many fungi display bright colors arising
from other cellular pigments ranging from red to green to black The poisonous Amanita muscaria fly agaric
is recognizable by its bright red cap with white patches Figure 242 Pigments in fungi are associated with the
cell wall and play a protective role against ultraviolet radiation Some fungal pigments are toxic to humans

Like plant cells fungal cells have a thick cell wall The rigid layers of fungal cell walls contain complex
