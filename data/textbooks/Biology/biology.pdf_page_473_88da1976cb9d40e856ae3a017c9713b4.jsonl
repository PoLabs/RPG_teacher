Figure 173 This diagram shows the basic method of DNA extraction
Scientists perform RNA analysis to study gene expression patterns in cells RNA is naturally very unstable
because RNAses are commonly present in nature and very difficult to inactivate Similar to DNA RNA extraction
involves using various buffers and enzymes to inactivate macromolecules and preserve the RNA
Gel Electrophoresis
Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment an electric
field can mobilize them Gel electrophoresis is a technique that scientists use to separate molecules on the
basis of size using this charge One can separate the nucleic acids as whole chromosomes or fragments
The nucleic acids load into a slot near the semisolid porous gel matrixs negative electrode and pulled toward
the positive electrode at the gels opposite end Smaller molecules move through the gels pores faster than
larger molecules This difference in the migration rate separates the fragments on the basis of size There
are molecular weight standard samples that researchers can run alongside the molecules to provide a size
comparison We can observe nucleic acids in a gel matrix using various fluorescent or colored dyes Distinct
nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the gels top the negative electrode end on
the basis of their size Figure 174 A mixture of genomic DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long
smear whereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at
the gels top
