fish actively take in salt through their gills and excrete diluted urine to rid themselves of excess water Saltwater
fish live in the reverse environment which is hypertonic to their cells and they secrete salt through their gills and
excrete highly concentrated urine
In vertebrates the kidneys regulate the water amount in the body Osmoreceptors are specialized cells in the
brain that monitor solute concentration in the blood If the solute levels increase beyond a certain range a
hormone releases that slows water loss through the kidney and dilutes the blood to safer levels Animals also
have high albumin concentrations which the liver produces in their blood This protein is too large to pass easily
through plasma membranes and is a major factor in controlling the osmotic pressures applied to tissues
53  Active Transport
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Understand how electrochemical gradients affect ions

Distinguish between primary active transport and secondary active transport
Active transport mechanisms require the cells energy usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate ATP If
a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradientthat is if the substances concentration
inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid and vice versathe cell must use energy
to move the substance Some active transport mechanisms move smallmolecular weight materials such as
ions through the membrane Other mechanisms transport much larger molecules
Electrochemical Gradient
We have discussed simple concentration gradientsa substances differential concentrations across a space or
a membranebut in living systems gradients are more complex Because ions move into and out of cells and
because cells contain proteins that do not move across the membrane and are mostly negatively charged there
is also an electrical gradient a difference of charge across the plasma membrane The interior of living cells is
electrically negative with respect to the extracellular fluid in which they are bathed and at the same time cells
have higher concentrations of potassium K and lower concentrations of sodium Na than the extracellular
fluid Thus in a living cell the concentration gradient of Na tends to drive it into the cell and its electrical gradient
a positive ion also drives it inward to the negatively charged interior However the situation is more complex for
other elements such as potassium The electrical gradient of K a positive ion also drives it into the cell but the
concentration gradient of K drives K out of the cell Figure 516 We call the combined concentration gradient
and electrical charge that affects an ion its electrochemical gradient
