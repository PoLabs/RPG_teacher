Nucleic Acid Fragment Amplification by Polymerase Chain Reaction
Although genomic DNA is visible to the naked eye when it is extracted in bulk DNA analysis often requires
focusing on one or more specific genome regions Polymerase chain reaction PCR is a technique that
scientists use to amplify specific DNA regions for further analysis Figure 175 Researchers use PCR for many
purposes in laboratories such as cloning gene fragments to analyze genetic diseases identifying contaminant
foreign DNA in a sample and amplifying DNA for sequencing More practical applications include determining
paternity and detecting genetic diseases
