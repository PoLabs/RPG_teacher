Lakes and islands are particularly vulnerable to extinction threats from introduced species In Lake Victoria as
mentioned earlier the intentional introduction of the Nile perch was largely responsible for the extinction of about
200 species of endemic cichlids The accidental introduction of the brown tree snake via aircraft Figure 4712
from the Solomon Islands to Guam in 1950 has led to the extinction of three species of birds and three to five
species of reptiles endemic to the island Several other species are still threatened The brown tree snake is
adept at exploiting human transportation as a means to migrate one was even found on an aircraft arriving in
Corpus Christi Texas Constant vigilance on the part of airport military and commercial aircraft personnel is
required to prevent the snake from moving from Guam to other islands in the Pacific especially Hawaii Islands
do not make up a large area of land on the globe but they do contain a disproportionate number of endemic
species because of their isolation from mainland ancestors

It now appears that the global decline in amphibian species recognized in the 1990s is in some part caused by
the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis which causes the disease chytridiomycosis Figure 4713 There
is evidence that the fungus is native to Africa and may have been spread throughout the world by transport
of a commonly used laboratory and pet species the African clawed toad Xenopus laevis It may well be
that biologists themselves are responsible for spreading this disease worldwide The North American bullfrog
Rana catesbeiana which has also been widely introduced as a food animal but which easily escapes captivity
survives most infections of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and can act as a reservoir for the disease It also is
a voracious predator in freshwater lakes
