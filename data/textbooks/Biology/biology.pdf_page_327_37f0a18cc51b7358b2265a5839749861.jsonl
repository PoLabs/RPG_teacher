The Mystery of the Evolution of Meiosis
Some characteristics of organisms are so widespread and fundamental that it is sometimes difficult to
remember that they evolved like other simple traits Meiosis is such an extraordinarily complex series of
cellular events that biologists have had trouble testing hypotheses concerning how it may have evolved
Although meiosis is inextricably entwined with sexual reproduction and its advantages and disadvantages
it is important to separate the questions of the evolution of meiosis and the evolution of sex because early
meiosis may have been advantageous for different reasons than it is now Thinking outside the box and
imagining what the early benefits from meiosis might have been is one approach to uncovering how it may
have evolved
Meiosis and mitosis share obvious cellular processes and it makes sense that meiosis evolved from
mitosis The difficulty lies in the clear differences between meiosis I and mitosis Adam Wilkins and Robin
Holliday

summarized the unique events that needed to occur for the evolution of meiosis from mitosis
These steps are homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis crossover exchanges sister chromatids
remaining attached during anaphase and suppression of DNA replication in interphase They argue that
the first step is the hardest and most important and that understanding how it evolved would make the
evolutionary process clearer They suggest genetic experiments that might shed light on the evolution of
synapsis
There are other approaches to understanding the evolution of meiosis in progress Different forms of meiosis
exist in singlecelled protists Some appear to be simpler or more primitive forms of meiosis Comparing
the meiotic divisions of different protists may shed light on the evolution of meiosis Marilee Ramesh and
colleagues

compared the genes involved in meiosis in protists to understand when and where meiosis
might have evolved Although research is still ongoing recent scholarship into meiosis in protists suggests
that some aspects of meiosis may have evolved later than others This kind of genetic comparison can tell
us what aspects of meiosis are the oldest and what cellular processes they may have borrowed from in
earlier cells
