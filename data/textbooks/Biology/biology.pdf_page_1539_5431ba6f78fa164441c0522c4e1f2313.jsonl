Active transport proteins ensure that glucose moves into the intestinal cells and cannot move back into the gut It also
ensures that glucose transport continues to occur even if high levels of glucose are already present in the intestinal
cells This maximizes the amount of energy the body can harvest from food 33 The proteins allow a cell to select
what compound will be transported meeting the needs of the cell and not bringing in anything else

1 Figure 68 A compost pile decomposing is an exergonic process enthalpy increases energy is released and
entropy increases large molecules are broken down into smaller ones A baby developing from a fertilized egg is
an endergonic process enthalpy decreases energy is absorbed and entropy decreases Sand art being destroyed
is an exergonic process there is no change in enthalpy but entropy increases A ball rolling downhill is an exergonic
process enthalpy decreases energy is released but there is no change in entropy 3 Figure 614 Three sodium ions
could be moved by the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule The G of the coupled reaction must be negative Movement
of three sodium ions across the membrane will take 63 kcal of energy 21 kcal  3 Na ions  63 kcal Hydrolysis of
ATP provides 73 kcal of energy more than enough to power this reaction Movement of four sodium ions across the
membrane however would require 84 kcal of energy more than one ATP molecule can provide 4 C 6 C 8 B 10
A 12 A 14 C 16 Physical exercise involves both anabolic and catabolic processes Body cells break down sugars
to provide ATP to do the work necessary for exercise such as muscle contractions This is catabolism Muscle cells
also must repair muscle tissue damaged by exercise by building new muscle This is anabolism 18 A spontaneous
reaction is one that has a negative G and thus releases energy However a spontaneous reaction need not occur
quickly or suddenly like an instantaneous reaction It may occur over long periods due to a large energy of activation
which prevents the reaction from occurring quickly 20 The ant farm had lower entropy before the earthquake because
it was a highly ordered system After the earthquake the system became much more disordered and had higher
entropy 22 The activation energy for hydrolysis is very low Not only is ATP hydrolysis an exergonic process with a
large G but ATP is also a very unstable molecule that rapidly breaks down into ADP  Pi if not utilized quickly This
suggests a very low EA since it hydrolyzes so quickly 24 Feedback inhibition allows cells to control the amounts of
metabolic products produced If there is too much of a particular product relative to the cells needs feedback inhibition
effectively causes the cell to decrease production of that particular product In general this reduces the production of
superfluous products and conserves energy maximizing energy efficiency

1 Figure 711 After DNP poisoning the electron transport chain can no longer form a proton gradient and ATP
synthase can no longer make ATP DNP is an effective diet drug because it uncouples ATP synthesis in other words
after taking it a person obtains less energy out of the food he or she eats Interestingly one of the worst side effects of
this drug is hyperthermia or overheating of the body Since ATP cannot be formed the energy from electron transport
is lost as heat 3 Figure 714 The illness is caused by lactate accumulation Lactate levels rise after exercise making
the symptoms worse Milk sickness is rare today but was common in the midwestern United States in the early
1800s 4 A 6 C 8 B 10 C 12 C 14 A 16 A 18 ATP provides the cell with a way to handle energy in an efficient
manner The molecule can be charged stored and used as needed Moreover the energy from hydrolyzing ATP
is delivered as a consistent amount Harvesting energy from the bonds of several different compounds would result
in energy deliveries of different quantities 20 All cells must consume energy to carry out basic functions such as
pumping ions across membranes A red blood cell would lose its membrane potential if glycolysis were blocked and
it would eventually die 22 Q and cytochrome c are transport molecules Their function does not result directly in ATP
synthesis in that they are not pumps Moreover Q is the only component of the electron transport chain that is not
a protein Ubiquinone and cytochrome c are small mobile electron carriers whereas the other components of the
electron transport chain are large complexes anchored in the inner mitochondrial membrane 24 Fermentation uses
glycolysis only Anaerobic respiration uses all three parts of cellular respiration including the parts in the mitochondria
like the citric acid cycle and electron transport it also uses a different final electron acceptor instead of oxygen gas 26
Citrate can inhibit phosphofructokinase by feedback regulation

21 The
outcome of light reactions in photosynthesis is the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy that the chloroplasts
can use to do work mostly anabolic production of carbohydrates from carbon dioxide 23 The energy carriers that
move from the lightdependent reaction to the lightindependent one are full because they bring energy After the
energy is released the empty energy carriers return to the lightdependent reaction to obtain more energy There
is not much actual movement involved Both ATP and NADPH are produced in the stroma where they are also used
and reconverted into ADP Pi and NADP 25 The stomata regulate the exchange of gases and water vapor between
a leaf and its surrounding environment When the stomata are closed the water molecules cannot escape the leaf
