fertilized ovule forms the other tissues of the seed
A doublelayered integument protects the megasporangium and later the embryo sac The integument will
develop into the seed coat after fertilization and protect the entire seed The ovule wall will become part of the
fruit The integuments while protecting the megasporangium do not enclose it completely but leave an opening
called the micropyle The micropyle allows the pollen tube to enter the female gametophyte for fertilization
Figure 328 As shown in this diagram of the embryo sac in angiosperms the ovule is covered by integuments
and has an opening called a micropyle Inside the embryo sac are three antipodal cells two synergids a central
cell and the egg cell
An embryo sac is missing the synergids What specific impact would you expect this to have on fertilization
a
The pollen tube will be unable to form
b
The pollen tube will form but will not be guided toward the egg
c
Fertilization will not occur because the synergid is the egg
d
Fertilization will occur but the embryo will not be able to grow
Sexual Reproduction in Gymnosperms
As with angiosperms the lifecycle of a gymnosperm is also characterized by alternation of generations In
conifers such as pines the green leafy part of the plant is the sporophyte and the cones contain the male
and female gametophytes Figure 329 The female cones are larger than the male cones and are positioned
towards the top of the tree the small male cones are located in the lower region of the tree Because the pollen
is shed and blown by the wind this arrangement makes it difficult for a gymnosperm to selfpollinate
