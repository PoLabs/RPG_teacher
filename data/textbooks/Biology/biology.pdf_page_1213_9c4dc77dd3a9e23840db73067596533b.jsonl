Hinge Joints
In hinge joints the slightly rounded end of one bone fits into the slightly hollow end of the other bone In this
way one bone moves while the other remains stationary like the hinge of a door The elbow is an example of a
hinge joint The knee is sometimes classified as a modified hinge joint Figure 3828

Pivot Joints
Pivot joints consist of the rounded end of one bone fitting into a ring formed by the other bone This structure
allows rotational movement as the rounded bone moves around its own axis An example of a pivot joint is the
joint of the first and second vertebrae of the neck that allows the head to move back and forth Figure 3829
The joint of the wrist that allows the palm of the hand to be turned up and down is also a pivot joint
