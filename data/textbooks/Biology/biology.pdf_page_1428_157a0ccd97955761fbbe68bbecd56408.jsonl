is decreasing in size or zero where the populations size is unchanging a condition known as zero population
growth A further refinement of the formula recognizes that different species have inherent differences in
their intrinsic rate of increase often thought of as the potential for reproduction even under ideal conditions
Obviously a bacterium can reproduce more rapidly and have a higher intrinsic rate of growth than a human The
maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic potential or rmax thus changing the equation to

When resources are limited populations exhibit logistic growth In logistic growth population expansion decreases as
resources become scarce and it levels off when the carrying capacity of the environment is reached resulting in an
Sshaped curve
Logistic Growth
Exponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available this is not the case in the real
world Charles Darwin recognized this fact in his description of the struggle for existence which states that
individuals will compete with members of their own or other species for limited resources The successful ones
will survive to pass on their own characteristics and traits which we know now are transferred by genes to
the next generation at a greater rate natural selection To model the reality of limited resources population
ecologists developed the logistic growth model
Carrying Capacity and the Logistic Model
In the real world with its limited resources exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely Exponential growth
may occur in environments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources but when the number of
individuals gets large enough resources will be depleted slowing the growth rate Eventually the growth rate
will plateau or level off Figure 459 This population size which represents the maximum population size that
a particular environment can support is called the carrying capacity or K
The formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth
rate The expression K  N indicates how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage and
K  N divided by K is the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth Thus the exponential
growth model is restricted by this factor to generate the logistic growth equation

K
Notice that when N is very small KNK becomes close to KK or 1 and the right side of the equation reduces
to rmaxN which means the population is growing exponentially and is not influenced by carrying capacity On the
other hand when N is large KNK comes close to zero which means that population growth will be slowed
greatly or even stopped Thus population growth is greatly slowed in large populations by the carrying capacity
K This model also allows for the population of a negative population growth or a population decline This occurs
when the number of individuals in the population exceeds the carrying capacity because the value of KNK is
negative
A graph of this equation yields an Sshaped curve Figure 459 and it is a more realistic model of population
growth than exponential growth There are three different sections to an Sshaped curve Initially growth is
exponential because there are few individuals and ample resources available Then as resources begin to
