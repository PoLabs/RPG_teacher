how species have adapted to changing environmental conditions and how different species are related to one
another through common descent much about virus origins and evolution remains unknown
Discovery and Detection
Viruses were first discovered after the development of a porcelain filterthe ChamberlandPasteur filterthat
could remove all bacteria visible in the microscope from any liquid sample In 1886 Adolph Meyer demonstrated
that a disease of tobacco plants tobacco mosaic diseasecould be transferred from a diseased plant to a
healthy one via liquid plant extracts In 1892 Dmitri Ivanowski showed that this disease could be transmitted in
this way even after the ChamberlandPasteur filter had removed all viable bacteria from the extract Still it was
many years before it was proved that these filterable infectious agents were not simply very small bacteria but
were a new type of very small diseasecausing particle
Most virions or single virus particles are very small about 20 to 250 nanometers in diameter However some
recently discovered viruses from amoebae range up to 1000 nm in diameter With the exception of large virions
like the poxvirus and other large DNA viruses viruses cannot be seen with a light microscope It was not until the
development of the electron microscope in the late 1930s that scientists got their first good view of the structure
of the tobacco mosaic virus TMV Figure 211 discussed above and other viruses Figure 212 The surface
structure of virions can be observed by both scanning and transmission electron microscopy whereas the
internal structures of the virus can only be observed in images from a transmission electron microscope The
use of electron microscopy and other technologies has allowed for the discovery of many viruses of all types of
living organisms

Evolution of Viruses
Although biologists have a significant amount of knowledge about how presentday viruses mutate and adapt
much less is known about how viruses originated in the first place When exploring the evolutionary history
of most organisms scientists can look at fossil records and similar historic evidence However viruses do not
fossilize as far as we know so researchers must extrapolate from investigations of how todays viruses evolve
and by using biochemical and genetic information to create speculative virus histories
Most scholars agree that viruses dont have a single common ancestor nor is there a single reasonable
hypothesis about virus origins There are current evolutionary scenarios that may explain the origin of viruses
One such hypothesis the devolution or the regressive hypothesis suggests that viruses evolved from free
living cells or from intracellular prokaryotic parasites However many components of how this process might
