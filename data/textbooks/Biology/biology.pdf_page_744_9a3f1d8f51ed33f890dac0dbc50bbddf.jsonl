of gymnosperms with only one surviving speciesthe Ginkgo bilobawere the first gymnosperms to appear
during the lower Jurassic Gymnosperms expanded in the Mesozoic era about 240 million years ago
supplanting ferns in the landscape and reaching their greatest diversity during this time The Jurassic period
was as much the age of the cycads palmtreelike gymnosperms as the age of the dinosaurs Ginkgoales and
the more familiar conifers also dotted the landscape Although angiosperms flowering plants are the major form
of plant life in most biomes gymnosperms still dominate some ecosystems such as the taiga boreal forests
and the alpine forests at higher mountain elevations Figure 264 because of their adaptation to cold and dry
growth conditions

Seeds and Pollen as an Evolutionary Adaptation to Dry Land
Bryophyte and fern spores are haploid cells dependent on moisture for rapid development of multicellular
gametophytes In the seed plants the female gametophyte consists of just a few cells the egg and some
supportive cells including the endospermproducing cell that will support the growth of the embryo After
fertilization of the egg the diploid zygote produces an embryo that will grow into the sporophyte when the seed
germinates Storage tissue to sustain growth of the embryo and a protective coat give seeds their superior
evolutionary advantage Several layers of hardened tissue prevent desiccation and free the embryo from the
need for a constant supply of water Furthermore seeds remain in a state of dormancyinduced by desiccation
and the hormone abscisic aciduntil conditions for growth become favorable Whether blown by the wind
floating on water or carried away by animals seeds are scattered in an expanding geographic range thus
avoiding competition with the parent plant
Pollen grains Figure 265 are male gametophytes containing just a few cells and are distributed by wind water
or an animal pollinator The whole structure is protected from desiccation and can reach the female organs
without depending on water After reaching a female gametophyte the pollen grain grows a tube that will deliver
a male nucleus to the egg cell The sperm of modern gymnosperms and all angiosperms lack flagella but in
cycads Ginkgo and other primitive gymnosperms the sperm are still motile and use flagella to swim to the
female gamete however they are delivered to the female gametophyte enclosed in a pollen grain The pollen
grows or is taken into a fertilization chamber where the motile sperm are released and swim a short distance to
an egg
