How closely the histone proteins associate with the DNA is regulated by signals found on both the histone
proteins and on the DNA These signals are functional groups added to histone proteins or to DNA and
determine whether a chromosomal region should be open or closed Figure 168 depicts modifications to
histone proteins and DNA These tags are not permanent but may be added or removed as needed Some
chemical groups phosphate methyl or acetyl groups are attached to specific amino acids in histone tails at
the Nterminus of the protein These groups do not alter the DNA base sequence but they do alter how tightly
wound the DNA is around the histone proteins DNA is a negatively charged molecule and unmodified histones
are positively charged therefore changes in the charge of the histone will change how tightly wound the DNA
molecule will be By adding chemical modifications like acetyl groups the charge becomes less positive and
the binding of DNA to the histones is relaxed Altering the location of nucleosomes and the tightness of histone
binding opens some regions of chromatin to transcription and closes others
The DNA molecule itself can also be modified by methylation DNA methylation occurs within very specific
regions called CpG islands These are stretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA
pairs CG found in the promoter regions of genes The cytosine member of the CG pair can be methylated a
methyl group is added Methylated genes are usually silenced although methylation may have other regulatory
effects In some cases genes that are silenced during the development of the gametes of one parent are
transmitted in their silenced condition to the offspring Such genes are said to be imprinted Parental diet or
other environmental conditions may also affect the methylation patterns of genes which in turn modifies gene
expression Changes in chromatin organization interact with DNA methylation DNA methyltransferases appear
to be attracted to chromatin regions with specific histone modifications Highly methylated hypermethylated
DNA regions with deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally inactive

Epigenetic changes are not permanent although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division and
may even cross generational lines Chromatin remodeling alters the chromosomal structure open or closed as
needed If a gene is to be transcribed the histone proteins and DNA in the chromosomal region encoding that
gene are modified in a way that opens the promoter region to allow RNA polymerase and other proteins called
transcription factors to bind and initiate transcription If a gene is to remain turned off or silenced the histone
proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration In this closed
configuration the RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access to the DNA and transcription
cannot occur Figure 168
