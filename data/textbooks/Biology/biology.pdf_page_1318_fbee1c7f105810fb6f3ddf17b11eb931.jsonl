Figure 427 The classic pathway for the complement cascade involves the attachment of several initial complement
proteins to an antibodybound pathogen followed by rapid activation and binding of many more complement proteins
and the creation of destructive pores in the microbial cell envelope and cell wall The alternate pathway does not
involve antibody activation Rather C3 convertase spontaneously breaks down C3 Endogenous regulatory proteins
prevent the complement complex from binding to host cells Pathogens lacking these regulatory proteins are lysed
