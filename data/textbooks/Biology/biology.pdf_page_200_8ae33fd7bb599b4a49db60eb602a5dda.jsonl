Figure 617 Competitive and noncompetitive inhibition affect the reactions rate differently Competitive inhibitors affect
the initial rate but do not affect the maximal rate whereas noncompetitive inhibitors affect the maximal rate
Some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change
that reduces the enzymes affinity for its substrate This type of inhibition is an allosteric inhibition Figure
618 More than one polypeptide comprise most allosterically regulated enzymes meaning that they have
more than one protein subunit When an allosteric inhibitor binds to an enzyme all active sites on the protein
subunits change slightly such that they bind their substrates with less efficiency There are allosteric activators
as well as inhibitors Allosteric activators bind to locations on an enzyme away from the active site inducing a
conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzymes active sites for its substrates
Figure 618 Allosteric inhibitors modify the enzymes active site so that substrate binding is reduced or prevented In
contrast allosteric activators modify the enzymes active site so that the affinity for the substrate increases
