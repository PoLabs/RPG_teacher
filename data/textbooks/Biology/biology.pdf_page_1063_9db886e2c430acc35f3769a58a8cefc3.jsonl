specific roles in the digestive process The animal diet needs carbohydrates protein and fat as well as vitamins
and inorganic components for nutritional balance How each of these components is digested is discussed in the
following sections
Carbohydrates
The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth The salivary enzyme amylase begins the breakdown of
food starches into maltose a disaccharide As the bolus of food travels through the esophagus to the stomach
no significant digestion of carbohydrates takes place The esophagus produces no digestive enzymes but does
produce mucous for lubrication The acidic environment in the stomach stops the action of the amylase enzyme
The next step of carbohydrate digestion takes place in the duodenum Recall that the chyme from the stomach
enters the duodenum and mixes with the digestive secretion from the pancreas liver and gallbladder Pancreatic
juices also contain amylase which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose a
disaccharide The disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases
sucrases and lactases which are also present in the brush border of the small intestinal wall Maltase breaks
down maltose into glucose Other disaccharides such as sucrose and lactose are broken down by sucrase
and lactase respectively Sucrase breaks down sucrose or table sugar into glucose and fructose and
lactase breaks down lactose or milk sugar into glucose and galactose The monosaccharides glucose thus
produced are absorbed and then can be used in metabolic pathways to harness energy The monosaccharides
are transported across the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream to be transported to the different cells in the
body The steps in carbohydrate digestion are summarized in Figure 3416 and Table 345
Figure 3416 Digestion of carbohydrates is performed by several enzymes Starch and glycogen are broken down into
glucose by amylase and maltase Sucrose table sugar and lactose milk sugar are broken down by sucrase and
lactase respectively

Protein
A large part of protein digestion takes place in the stomach The enzyme pepsin plays an important role in the
digestion of proteins by breaking down the intact protein to peptides which are short chains of four to nine amino
acids In the duodenum other enzymes trypsin elastase and chymotrypsinact on the peptides reducing
them to smaller peptides Trypsin elastase carboxypeptidase and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas
and released into the duodenum where they act on the chyme Further breakdown of peptides to single amino
acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases those that breakdown peptides Specifically carboxypeptidase
