It is important to note that lichens are not a single organism but rather another wonderful example of a
mutualism in which a fungus usually a member of the Ascomycota or Basidiomycota lives in a physical and
physiological relationship with a photosynthetic organism a eukaryotic alga or a prokaryotic cyanobacterium
Figure 2424 Generally neither the fungus nor the photosynthetic organism can survive alone outside of the
symbiotic relationship The body of a lichen referred to as a thallus is formed of hyphae wrapped around the
photosynthetic partner The photosynthetic organism provides carbon and energy in the form of carbohydrates
Some cyanobacteria additionally fix nitrogen from the atmosphere contributing nitrogenous compounds to the
association In return the fungus supplies minerals and protection from dryness and excessive light by encasing
the algae in its mycelium The fungus also attaches the lichen to its substrate
Figure 2424 Structure of a lichen This crosssection of a lichen thallus shows the a upper cortex of fungal hyphae
which provides protection the b algal zone where photosynthesis occurs the c medulla of fungal hyphae and the
d lower cortex which also provides protection and may have e rhizines to anchor the thallus to the substrate
The thallus of lichens grows very slowly expanding its diameter a few millimeters per year Both the fungus
and the alga participate in the formation of dispersal units called sorediaclusters of algal cells surrounded by
mycelia Soredia are dispersed by wind and water and form new lichens
Lichens are extremely sensitive to air pollution especially to abnormal levels of nitrogenous and sulfurous
compounds The US Forest Service and National Park Service can monitor air quality by measuring the relative
abundance and health of the lichen population in an area Lichens fulfill many ecological roles Caribou and
reindeer eat lichens and they provide cover for small invertebrates that hide in the mycelium In the production
of textiles weavers used lichens to dye wool for many centuries until the advent of synthetic dyes The pigments
used in litmus paper are also extracted from lichens
