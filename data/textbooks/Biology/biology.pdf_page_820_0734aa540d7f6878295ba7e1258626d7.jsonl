Figure 2819 A proboscis worm The proboscis worm Parborlasia corrugatus is a scavenger that combs the sea floor
for food The species is a member of the phylum Nemertea The specimen shown here was photographed in the Ross
Sea Antarctica credit Henry Kaiser National Science Foundation
A unique characteristic of this phylum is the presence of an eversible proboscis enclosed in a pocket called a
rhynchocoel not part of the animals actual coelom The proboscis is located dorsal to the gut and serves
as a harpoon or tentacle for food capture In some species it is ornamented with barbs The rhynchocoel is
a fluidfilled cavity that extends from the head to nearly twothirds of the length of the gut in these animals
Figure 2820 The proboscis may be extended by hydrostatic pressure generated by contraction of muscle of
the rhynchocoel and retracted by a retractor muscle attached to the rear wall of the rhynchocoel
Figure 2820 The anatomy of a Nemertean is shown

Digestive System
The nemerteans which are primarily predators of annelids and crustaceans have a welldeveloped digestive
system A mouth opening that is ventral to the rhynchocoel leads into the foregut followed by the intestine The
intestine is present in the form of diverticular pouches and ends in a rectum that opens via an anus Gonads are
interspersed with the intestinal diverticular pouches and open outward via genital pores
Nemerteans are sometimes classified as acoels but because their closed circulatory system is derived from the
coelomic cavity of the embryo they may be regarded as coelomic Their circulatory system consists of a closed
loop formed by a connected pair of lateral blood vessels Some species may also have a dorsal vessel or cross
connecting vessels in addition to lateral ones Although the circulatory fluid contains cells it is often colorless
However the blood cells of some species bear hemoglobin as well as other yellow or green pigments The blood
