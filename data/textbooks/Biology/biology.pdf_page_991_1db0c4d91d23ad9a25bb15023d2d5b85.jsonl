322  Pollination and Fertilization
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe what must occur for plant fertilization

Explain crosspollination and the ways in which it takes place

Describe the process that leads to the development of a seed

Define double fertilization
In angiosperms pollination is defined as the placement or transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the
same flower or another flower In gymnosperms pollination involves pollen transfer from the male cone to the
female cone Upon transfer the pollen germinates to form the pollen tube and the sperm for fertilizing the egg
Pollination has been well studied since the time of Gregor Mendel Mendel successfully carried out self as well
as crosspollination in garden peas while studying how characteristics were passed on from one generation to
the next Todays crops are a result of plant breeding which employs artificial selection to produce the present
day cultivars A case in point is todays corn which is a result of years of breeding that started with its ancestor
teosinte The teosinte that the ancient Mayans originally began cultivating had tiny seedsvastly different from
todays relatively giant ears of corn Interestingly though these two plants appear to be entirely different the
genetic difference between them is miniscule
Pollination takes two forms selfpollination and crosspollination Selfpollination occurs when the pollen from
the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant Crosspollination
is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of
the same species Selfpollination occurs in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time and
are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flowers stigma This method of pollination does not require an
