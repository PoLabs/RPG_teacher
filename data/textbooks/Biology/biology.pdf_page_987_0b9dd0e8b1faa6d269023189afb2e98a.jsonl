Figure 327 Pollen develops from the microspore mother cells The mature pollen grain is composed of two cells the
pollen tube cell and the generative cell which is inside the tube cell The pollen grain has two coverings an inner layer
intine and an outer layer exine The inset scanning electron micrograph shows Arabidopsis lyrata pollen grains

Each pollen grain has two coverings the exine thicker outer layer and the intine Figure 327 The exine
contains sporopollenin a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells Sporopollenin allows
the pollen to survive under unfavorable conditions and to be carried by wind water or biological agents without
undergoing damage
Female Gametophyte The Embryo Sac
While the details may vary between species the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct
phases First in the process of megasporogenesis a single cell in the diploid megasporangiuman area
of tissue in the ovulesundergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores only one of which survives During
the second phase megagametogenesis the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an
eightnucleate sevencell female gametophyte also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac Two of
the nucleithe polar nucleimove to the equator and fuse forming a single diploid central cell This central
cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm Three nuclei position themselves on the end of the
embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells which later degenerate The nucleus
closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete or egg cell and the two adjacent nuclei develop into
synergid cells Figure 328 The synergids help guide the pollen tube for successful fertilization after which
they disintegrate Once fertilization is complete the resulting diploid zygote develops into the embryo and the
