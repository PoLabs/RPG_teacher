Proteins are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range
of functions of all macromolecules Proteins may be structural regulatory contractile or protective They may
serve in transport storage or membranes or they may be toxins or enzymes Each cell in a living system may
contain thousands of proteins each with a unique function Their structures like their functions vary greatly
They are all however amino acid polymers arranged in a linear sequence
Types and Functions of Proteins
Enzymes which living cells produce are catalysts in biochemical reactions like digestion and are usually
complex or conjugated proteins Each enzyme is specific for the substrate a reactant that binds to an enzyme
upon which it acts The enzyme may help in breakdown rearrangement or synthesis reactions We call
enzymes that break down their substrates catabolic enzymes Those that build more complex molecules from
their substrates are anabolic enzymes and enzymes that affect the rate of reaction are catalytic enzymes Note
that all enzymes increase the reaction rate and therefore are organic catalysts An example of an enzyme is
salivary amylase which hydrolyzes its substrate amylose a component of starch
Hormones are chemicalsignaling molecules usually small proteins or steroids secreted by endocrine cells
that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes including growth development metabolism and
reproduction For example insulin is a protein hormone that helps regulate the blood glucose level Table 31
lists the primary types and functions of proteins

Effect muscle contraction
Storage
Legume storage proteins egg white
albumin
Provide nourishment in early embryo development and
the seedling

Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights Some proteins are globular in shape whereas others
are fibrous in nature For example hemoglobin is a globular protein but collagen located in our skin is a
fibrous protein Protein shape is critical to its function and many different types of chemical bonds maintain this
shape Changes in temperature pH and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the proteins
shape leading to loss of function or denaturation Different arrangements of the same 20 types of amino acids
comprise all proteins Two rare new amino acids were discovered recently selenocystein and pirrolysine and
additional new discoveries may be added to the list
Amino Acids
Amino acids are the monomers that comprise proteins Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure
which consists of a central carbon atom or the alpha  carbon bonded to an amino group NH2 a carboxyl
group COOH and to a hydrogen atom Every amino acid also has another atom or group of atoms bonded to
the central atom known as the R group Figure 322
