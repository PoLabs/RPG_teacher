Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions
There are several organs whose primary functions are nonendocrine but that also possess endocrine functions
These include the heart kidneys intestines thymus gonads and adipose tissue
The heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells These
cells release the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide ANP in response to increased blood volume High blood
volume causes the cells to be stretched resulting in hormone release ANP acts on the kidneys to reduce the
reabsorption of Na causing Na and water to be excreted in the urine ANP also reduces the amounts of renin
released by the kidneys and aldosterone released by the adrenal cortex further preventing the retention of water
In this way ANP causes a reduction in blood volume and blood pressure and reduces the concentration of Na
in the blood
The gastrointestinal tract produces several hormones that aid in digestion The endocrine cells are located in
the mucosa of the GI tract throughout the stomach and small intestine Some of the hormones produced include
