Figure 3521 The human cerebral cortex includes the frontal parietal temporal and occipital lobes
The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain over the eyes This lobe contains the olfactory bulb
which processes smells The frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex which is important for planning and
implementing movement Areas within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups and there is some
organization to this map as shown in Figure 3522 For example the neurons that control movement of the
fingers are next to the neurons that control movement of the hand Neurons in the frontal lobe also control
cognitive functions like maintaining attention speech and decisionmaking Studies of humans who have
damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are involved in personality socialization and assessing
risk
Figure 3522 Different parts of the motor cortex control different muscle groups Muscle groups that are neighbors in
the body are generally controlled by neighboring regions of the motor cortex as well For example the neurons that
control finger movement are near the neurons that control hand movement
The parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and
also reading Two of the parietal lobes main functions are processing somatosensationtouch sensations like
pressure pain heat coldand processing proprioceptionthe sense of how parts of the body are oriented in
space The parietal lobe contains a somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex
The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain It is primarily involved in visionseeing recognizing and
identifying the visual world
The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing
and interpreting sounds It also contains the hippocampus Greek for seahorsea structure that processes
memory formation The hippocampus is illustrated in Figure 3524 The role of the hippocampus in memory
was partially determined by studying one famous epileptic patient HM who had both sides of his hippocampus
