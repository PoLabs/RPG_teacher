the skin Regular fibrous connective tissue shown in Figure 3313 is found in tendons which connect muscles
to bones and ligaments which connect bones to bones
Figure 3313 Fibrous connective tissue from the tendon has strands of collagen fibers lined up in parallel
Cartilage
Cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers The cells
called chondrocytes make the matrix and fibers of the tissue Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the
tissue called lacunae
A cartilage with few collagen and elastic fibers is hyaline cartilage illustrated in Figure 3314 The lacunae
are randomly scattered throughout the tissue and the matrix takes on a milky or scrubbed appearance with
routine histological stains Sharks have cartilaginous skeletons as does nearly the entire human skeleton during
a specific prebirth developmental stage A remnant of this cartilage persists in the outer portion of the human
nose Hyaline cartilage is also found at the ends of long bones reducing friction and cushioning the articulations
of these bones
Figure 3314 Hyaline cartilage consists of a matrix with cells called chondrocytes embedded in it The chondrocytes
exist in cavities in the matrix called lacunae
Elastic cartilage has a large amount of elastic fibers giving it tremendous flexibility The ears of most vertebrate
animals contain this cartilage as do portions of the larynx or voice box Fibrocartilage contains a large amount
of collagen fibers giving the tissue tremendous strength Fibrocartilage comprises the intervertebral discs in
vertebrate animals Hyaline cartilage found in movable joints such as the knee and shoulder becomes damaged
as a result of age or trauma Damaged hyaline cartilage is replaced by fibrocartilage and results in the joints
becoming stiff
