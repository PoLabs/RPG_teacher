The Chromosome 18 Inversion
Not all chromosomes structural rearrangements produce nonviable impaired or infertile individuals In rare
instances such a change can result in new species evolving In fact a pericentric inversion in chromosome
18 appears to have contributed to human evolution This inversion is not present in our closest genetic
relatives the chimpanzees Humans and chimpanzees differ cytogenetically by pericentric inversions on
several chromosomes and by the fusion of two separate chromosomes in chimpanzees that correspond to
chromosome two in humans
Scientists believe the pericentric chromosome 18 inversion occurred in early humans following their
divergence from a common ancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago Researchers
characterizing this inversion have suggested that approximately 19000 nucleotide bases were duplicated
on 18p and the duplicated region inverted and reinserted on chromosome 18 of an ancestral human
A comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this inversion indicates that two
genesROCK1 and USP14that are adjacent on chimpanzee chromosome 17 which corresponds to
human chromosome 18 are more distantly positioned on human chromosome 18 This suggests that one
of the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes Interestingly humans and chimpanzees
express USP14 at distinct levels in specific cell types including cortical cells and fibroblasts Perhaps the
chromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific genes and reset their expression
levels in a useful way Because both ROCK1 and USP14 encode cellular enzymes a change in their
expression could alter cellular function We do not know how this inversion contributed to hominid evolution
but it appears to be a significant factor in the divergence of humans from other primates

Translocations
A translocation occurs when a chromosome segment dissociates and reattaches to a different nonhomologous
chromosome Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions
of genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences Notably specific translocations have occurred
with several cancers and with schizophrenia Reciprocal translocations result from exchanging chromosome
segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes such that there is no genetic information gain or loss
