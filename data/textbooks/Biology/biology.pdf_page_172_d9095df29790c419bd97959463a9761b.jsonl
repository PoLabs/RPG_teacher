into the cytoplasm The protein now has a higher affinity for sodium ions and the process starts again
Several things have happened as a result of this process At this point there are more sodium ions outside
the cell than inside and more potassium ions inside than out For every three sodium ions that move out two
potassium ions move in This results in the interior being slightly more negative relative to the exterior This
difference in charge is important in creating the conditions necessary for the secondary process The sodium
potassium pump is therefore an electrogenic pump a pump that creates a charge imbalance creating an
electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential

Secondary Active Transport Cotransport
Secondary active transport brings sodium ions and possibly other compounds into the cell As sodium ion
concentrations build outside of the plasma membrane because of the primary active transport process this
creates an electrochemical gradient If a channel protein exists and is open the sodium ions will pull through
the membrane This movement transports other substances that can attach themselves to the transport protein
through the membrane Figure 519 Many amino acids as well as glucose enter a cell this way This
secondary process also stores highenergy hydrogen ions in the mitochondria of plant and animal cells in order
to produce ATP The potential energy that accumulates in the stored hydrogen ions translates into kinetic energy
as the ions surge through the channel protein ATP synthase and that energy then converts ADP into ATP
Figure 519 An electrochemical gradient which primary active transport creates can move other substances
against their concentration gradients a process scientists call cotransport or secondary active transport credit

If the pH outside the cell decreases would you expect the amount of amino acids transported into the cell
to increase or decrease
