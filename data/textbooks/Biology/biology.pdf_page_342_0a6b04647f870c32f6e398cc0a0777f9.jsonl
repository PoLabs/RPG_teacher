one of its two copies to its offspring where they came together Moreover the physical observation of a
dominant trait could mean that the genetic composition of the organism included two dominant versions of the
characteristic or that it included one dominant and one recessive version Conversely the observation of a
recessive trait meant that the organism lacked any dominant versions of this characteristic
So why did Mendel repeatedly obtain 31 ratios in his crosses To understand how Mendel deduced the basic
mechanisms of inheritance that lead to such ratios we must first review the laws of probability
Probability Basics
Probabilities are mathematical measures of likelihood The empirical probability of an event is calculated by
dividing the number of times the event occurs by the total number of opportunities for the event to occur It is also
possible to calculate theoretical probabilities by dividing the number of times that an event is expected to occur
by the number of times that it could occur Empirical probabilities come from observations like those of Mendel
Theoretical probabilities on the other hand come from knowing how the events are produced and assuming
that the probabilities of individual outcomes are equal A probability of one for some event indicates that it is
guaranteed to occur whereas a probability of zero indicates that it is guaranteed not to occur An example of a
genetic event is a round seed produced by a pea plant
In one experiment Mendel demonstrated that the probability of the event round seed occurring was one in the
F1 offspring of truebreeding parents one of which has round seeds and one of which has wrinkled seeds When
the F1 plants were subsequently selfcrossed the probability of any given F2 offspring having round seeds was
now three out of four In other words in a large population of F2 offspring chosen at random 75 percent were
expected to have round seeds whereas 25 percent were expected to have wrinkled seeds Using large numbers
of crosses Mendel was able to calculate probabilities and use these to predict the outcomes of other crosses
The Product Rule and Sum Rule
Mendel demonstrated that pea plants transmit characteristics as discrete units from parent to offspring As
will be discussed Mendel also determined that different characteristics like seed color and seed texture
were transmitted independently of one another and could be considered in separate probability analyses For
instance performing a cross between a plant with green wrinkled seeds and a plant with yellow round seeds
still produced offspring that had a 31 ratio of greenyellow seeds ignoring seed texture and a 31 ratio of
roundwrinkled seeds ignoring seed color The characteristics of color and texture did not influence each other
The product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of
characteristics The product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be
calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone To demonstrate the product
rule imagine that you are rolling a sixsided die D and flipping a penny P at the same time The die may roll
any number from 16 D whereas the penny may turn up heads PH or tails PT The outcome of rolling the
die has no effect on the outcome of flipping the penny and vice versa There are 12 possible outcomes of this
action Table 122 and each event is expected to occur with equal probability
