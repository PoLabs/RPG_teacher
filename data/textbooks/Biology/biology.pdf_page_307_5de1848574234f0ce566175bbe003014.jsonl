105  Prokaryotic Cell Division
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the process of binary fission in prokaryotes

Explain how FtsZ and tubulin proteins are examples of homology
Prokaryotes such as bacteria produce daughter cells by binary fission For unicellular organisms cell division
is the only method to produce new individuals In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells the outcome of cell
reproduction is a pair of daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell In unicellular organisms
daughter cells are individuals
To achieve the outcome of cloned offspring certain steps are essential The genomic DNA must be replicated
and then allocated into the daughter cells the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells
the cellular machinery to sustain life As weve seen with bacterial cells the genome consists of a single circular
DNA chromosome therefore the process of cell division is simplified Karyokinesis is unnecessary because
there is no true nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the multiple chromosomes into each daughter
cell This type of cell division is called binary prokaryotic fission
Binary Fission
Due to the relative simplicity of the prokaryotes the cell division process is a less complicated and much
more rapid process than cell division in eukaryotes As a review of the general information on cell division
we discussed at the beginning of this chapter recall that the single circular DNA chromosome of bacteria
occupies a specific location the nucleoid region within the cell Figure 102 Although the DNA of the nucleoid
is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size there are no histone proteins
and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes The packing proteins of bacteria are however related to the cohesin
and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes
The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell The starting
point of replication the origin is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane
Figure 1015 Replication of the DNA is bidirectional moving away from the origin on both strands of the
loop simultaneously As the new double strands are formed each origin point moves away from the cell
wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell As the cell elongates the growing membrane aids in
the transport of the chromosomes After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell
cytoplasmic separation begins The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ
short for filamenting temperaturesensitive mutant Z directs the partition between the nucleoids Formation of
the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell
wall materials to the site A septum is formed between the daughter nucleoids extending gradually from the
periphery toward the center of the cell When the new cell walls are in place the daughter cells separate
