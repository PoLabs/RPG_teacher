of a hormone in response to another hormone A number of endocrine glands release hormones when stimulated by
hormones released by other endocrine organs For example the hypothalamus produces hormones that stimulate the
anterior pituitary The anterior pituitary in turn releases hormones that regulate hormone production by other endocrine
glands For example the anterior pituitary releases thyroidstimulating hormone which stimulates the thyroid gland
to produce the hormones T3 and T4 As blood concentrations of T3 and T4 rise they inhibit both the pituitary and
the hypothalamus in a negative feedback loop 33 The main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone which regulates the
concentration of ions in urine sweat and saliva Aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex is stimulated by a
decrease in blood concentrations of sodium ions blood volume or blood pressure or an increase in blood potassium
levels 35 Damage to the posterior pituitary gland would prevent the release of ADH and oxytocin into the body
However the hypothalamuss ability to produce ADH would not be affected The hypothalamus would also still be able
to produce and release inhibiting hormones to regulate the anterior pituitary

continuous stimulation of the muscle plasma membrane At first muscle activity is intense and uncontrolled but the
ion gradients dissipate so electrical signals in the Ttubules are no longer possible The result is paralysis leading to
death by asphyxiation 4 A 6 D 8 D

25 The female pelvis is tilted
forward and is wider lighter and shallower than the male pelvis It also has a pubic angle that is broader than the male
pelvis 27 Hydrostatic skeletons protect internal organs from harm by cushioning them from external shock However
these skeletons do not provide protection from external trauma Exoskeletons are hard structures that protect the
organs from damage caused by their environment However since they are rigid they provide little shock absorption
so the animal will need to have other ways of cushioning its internal organs
29 Compact bone tissue forms the
hard external layer of all bones and consists of osteons Compact bone tissue is prominent in areas of bone at which
stresses are applied in only a few directions Spongy bone tissue forms the inner layer of all bones and consists of
trabeculae Spongy bone is prominent in areas of bones that are not heavily stressed or at which stresses arrive from
many directions 31 Thalidomide effected the development of the long bones of the arms disrupting endochondral
ossification The bones would have been able to develop into a template made of the calcified cartilage matrix but
new blood vessels could not be created Since no vessels invade the template the structure is not converted into
trabecular bone
33 Elevation is the movement of a bone upward such as when the shoulders are shrugged lifting
the scapulae Depression is the downward movement of a bone such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the
scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position 35 Because ATP is required for myosin to release
from actin muscles would remain rigidly contracted until more ATP was available for the myosin crossbridge release
This is why dead vertebrates undergo rigor mortis 37 Neurons will not be able to release neurotransmitter without
calcium Skeletal muscles have calcium stored and dont need any from the outside

B 8 D 10 B 12 D 14 C 16 The main bronchus is the conduit in the lung that funnels air to the airways where gas
exchange occurs The main bronchus attaches the lungs to the very end of the trachea where it bifurcates The trachea
is the cartilaginous structure that extends from the pharynx to the primary bronchi It serves to funnel air to the lungs
The alveoli are the sites of gas exchange they are located at the terminal regions of the lung and are attached to the
respiratory bronchioles The acinus is the structure in the lung where gas exchange occurs 18 FEV1FVC measures
the forced expiratory volume in one second in relation to the total forced vital capacity the total amount of air that is
exhaled from the lung from a maximal inhalation This ratio changes with alterations in lung function that arise from
diseases such as fibrosis asthma and COPD 20 Oxygen moves from the lung to the bloodstream to the tissues
according to the pressure gradient This is measured as the partial pressure of oxygen If the amount of oxygen drops
in the inspired air there would be reduced partial pressure This would decrease the driving force that moves the
oxygen into the blood and into the tissues PO2 is also reduced at high elevations PO2 at high elevations is lower
than at sea level because the total atmospheric pressure is less than atmospheric pressure at sea level 22 Increased
airway resistance increases the volume and pressure in the lung therefore the intrapleural pressure would be less
negative and breathing would be more difficult 24 The lung is particularly susceptible to changes in the magnitude
and direction of gravitational forces When someone is standing or sitting upright the pleural pressure gradient leads to
increased ventilation further down in the lung 26 Carbon monoxide has a higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen
This means that carbon monoxide will preferentially bind to hemoglobin over oxygen Administration of 100 percent
oxygen is an effective therapy because at that concentration oxygen will displace the carbon monoxide from the
hemoglobin
