Figure 3513 Nodes of Ranvier are gaps in myelin coverage along axons Nodes contain voltagegated K and Na
channels Action potentials travel down the axon by jumping from one node to the next
Synaptic Transmission
The synapse or gap is the place where information is transmitted from one neuron to another Synapses
usually form between axon terminals and dendritic spines but this is not universally true There are also axon
toaxon dendritetodendrite and axontocell body synapses The neuron transmitting the signal is called the
presynaptic neuron and the neuron receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron Note that these
designations are relative to a particular synapsemost neurons are both presynaptic and postsynaptic There
are two types of synapses chemical and electrical
Chemical Synapse
When an action potential reaches the axon terminal it depolarizes the membrane and opens voltagegated Na
channels Na ions enter the cell further depolarizing the presynaptic membrane This depolarization causes
voltagegated Ca2 channels to open Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes
small membranebound vesicles called synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with
the presynaptic membrane Synaptic vesicles are shown in Figure 3514 which is an image from a scanning
electron microscope
Figure 3514 This pseudocolored image taken with a scanning electron microscope shows an axon terminal that was
broken open to reveal synaptic vesicles blue and orange inside the neuron credit modification of work by Tina
Carvalho NIHNIGMS scalebar data from Matt Russell
Fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic
cleft the extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes as illustrated in Figure
3515 The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic
membrane
