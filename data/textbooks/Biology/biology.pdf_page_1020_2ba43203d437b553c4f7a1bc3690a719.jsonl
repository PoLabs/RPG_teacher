Figure 335 Shown are the planes of a quadrupedal goat and a bipedal human The midsagittal plane divides the body
exactly in half into right and left portions The frontal plane divides the front and back and the transverse plane divides
the body into upper and lower portions
Vertebrate animals have a number of defined body cavities as illustrated in Figure 336 Two of these are
major cavities that contain smaller cavities within them The dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the vertebral
or spinal cavities The ventral cavity contains the thoracic cavity which in turn contains the pleural cavity
around the lungs and the pericardial cavity which surrounds the heart The ventral cavity also contains the
abdominopelvic cavity which can be separated into the abdominal and the pelvic cavities
