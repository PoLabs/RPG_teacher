vasectomy in males in that the oviducts are severed and sealed
The uterus is a structure about the size of a womans fist This is lined with an endometrium rich in blood vessels
and mucus glands The uterus supports the developing embryo and fetus during gestation The thickest portion
of the wall of the uterus is made of smooth muscle Contractions of the smooth muscle in the uterus aid in
passing the baby through the vagina during labor A portion of the lining of the uterus sloughs off during each
menstrual period and then builds up again in preparation for an implantation Part of the uterus called the cervix
protrudes into the top of the vagina The cervix functions as the birth canal
The vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes It allows menstrual flow to leave the body It is
the receptacle for the penis during intercourse and the vessel for the delivery of offspring It is lined by stratified
squamous epithelial cells to protect the underlying tissue
Sexual Response during Intercourse
The sexual response in humans is both psychological and physiological Both sexes experience sexual arousal
through psychological and physical stimulation There are four phases of the sexual response During phase
one called excitement vasodilation leads to vasocongestion in erectile tissues in both men and women The
nipples clitoris labia and penis engorge with blood and become enlarged Vaginal secretions are released to
lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse During the second phase called the plateau stimulation continues
the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood and breathing and heart rate increase
During phase three or orgasm rhythmic involuntary contractions of muscles occur in both sexes In the male
the reproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict placing semen in the urethra then the urethra contracts
expelling the semen through the penis In women the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may
last slightly less than a second each During phase four or resolution the processes described in the first three
phases reverse themselves and return to their normal state Men experience a refractory period in which they
cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period of time ranging from minutes to hours
Gametogenesis Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis
Gametogenesis the production of sperm and eggs takes place through the process of meiosis During meiosis
two cell divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were
made during an earlier stage of the cells life cycle Meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of
chromosomes normally found in diploid cells The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the
production of eggs is called oogenesis
