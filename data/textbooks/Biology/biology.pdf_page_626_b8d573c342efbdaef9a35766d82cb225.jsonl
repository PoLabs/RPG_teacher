Epidemiologist
Epidemiology is the study of the occurrence distribution and determinants of health and disease in a
population It is therefore part of public health An epidemiologist studies the frequency and distribution of
diseases within human populations and environments
Epidemiologists collect data about a particular disease and track its spread to identify the original mode
of transmission They sometimes work in close collaboration with historians to try to understand the way
a disease evolved geographically and over time tracking the natural history of pathogens They gather
information from clinical records patient interviews surveillance and any other available means That
information is used to develop strategies such as vaccinations Figure 2226 and design public health
policies to reduce the incidence of a disease or to prevent its spread Epidemiologists also conduct rapid
investigations in case of an outbreak to recommend immediate measures to control it
An epidemiologist has a bachelors degree plus a masters degree in public health MPH Many
epidemiologists are also physicians and have an MD or DO degree or they have a PhD in an
associated field such as biology or microbiology

225  Beneficial Prokaryotes
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain the need for nitrogen fixation and how it is accomplished

Describe the beneficial effects of bacteria that colonize our skin and digestive tracts

Identify prokaryotes used during the processing of food

Describe the use of prokaryotes in bioremediation
Fortunately only a few species of prokaryotes are pathogenic Prokaryotes also interact with humans and other
organisms in a number of ways that are beneficial For example prokaryotes are major participants in the carbon
and nitrogen cycles They produce or process nutrients in the digestive tracts of humans and other animals
Prokaryotes are used in the production of some human foods and also have been recruited for the degradation
of hazardous materials In fact our life would not be possible without prokaryotes
