Antibodies of the Mucosal Immune System
Antibodies synthesized by the mucosal immune system include IgA and IgM Activated B cells differentiate into
mucosal plasma cells that synthesize and secrete dimeric IgA and to a lesser extent pentameric IgM Secreted
IgA is abundant in tears saliva breast milk and in secretions of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts
Antibody secretion results in a local humoral response at epithelial surfaces and prevents infection of the mucosa
by binding and neutralizing pathogens

By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe hypersensitivity

Define autoimmunity
A functioning immune system is essential for survival but even the sophisticated cellular and molecular defenses
of the mammalian immune response can be defeated by pathogens at virtually every step In the competition
between immune protection and pathogen evasion pathogens have the advantage of more rapid evolution
because of their shorter generation time and other characteristics For instance Streptococcus pneumoniae
bacterium that cause pneumonia and meningitis surrounds itself with a capsule that inhibits phagocytes from
engulfing it and displaying antigens to the adaptive immune system Staphylococcus aureus bacterium that can
cause skin infections abscesses and meningitis synthesizes a toxin called leukocidin that kills phagocytes after
they engulf the bacterium Other pathogens can also hinder the adaptive immune system HIV infects TH cells
via their CD4 surface molecules gradually depleting the number of TH cells in the body this inhibits the adaptive
immune systems capacity to generate sufficient responses to infection or tumors As a result HIVinfected
individuals often suffer from infections that would not cause illness in people with healthy immune systems but
which can cause devastating illness to immunecompromised individuals Maladaptive responses of immune
cells and molecules themselves can also disrupt the proper functioning of the entire system leading to host cell
damage that could become fatal
Immunodeficiency
Failures insufficiencies or delays at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or tumor cells to
gain a foothold and replicate or proliferate to high enough levels that the immune system becomes overwhelmed
Immunodeficiency is the failure insufficiency or delay in the response of the immune system which may
be acquired or inherited Immunodeficiency can be acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens
such as HIV chemical exposure including certain medical treatments malnutrition or possibly by extreme
stress For instance radiation exposure can destroy populations of lymphocytes and elevate an individuals
susceptibility to infections and cancer Dozens of genetic disorders result in immunodeficiencies including
Severe Combined Immunodeficiency SCID Bare lymphocyte syndrome and MHC II deficiencies Rarely
primary immunodeficiencies that are present from birth may occur Neutropenia is one form in which the immune
system produces a belowaverage number of neutrophils the bodys most abundant phagocytes As a result
bacterial infections may go unrestricted in the blood causing serious complications
Hypersensitivities
Maladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue
sensitization are termed hypersensitivities The types of hypersensitivities include immediate delayed and
autoimmunity A large proportion of the population is affected by one or more types of hypersensitivity
Allergies
The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibodymediated immune
response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy In the United States
20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma whereas 55 percent test positive against
one or more allergens Upon initial exposure to a potential allergen an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies
of the IgE class via the typical process of APCs presenting processed antigen to TH cells that stimulate B
cells to produce IgE This class of antibodies also mediates the immune response to parasitic worms The
