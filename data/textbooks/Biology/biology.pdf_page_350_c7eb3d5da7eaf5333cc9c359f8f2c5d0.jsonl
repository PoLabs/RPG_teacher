Figure 128 Four different alleles exist for the rabbit coat color C gene
The complete dominance of a wildtype phenotype over all other mutants often occurs as an effect of dosage
of a specific gene product such that the wildtype allele supplies the correct amount of gene product whereas
the mutant alleles cannot For the allelic series in rabbits the wildtype allele may supply a given dosage of fur
pigment whereas the mutants supply a lesser dosage or none at all Interestingly the Himalayan phenotype
is the result of an allele that produces a temperaturesensitive gene product that only produces pigment in the
cooler extremities of the rabbits body
Alternatively one mutant allele can be dominant over all other phenotypes including the wild type This may
occur when the mutant allele somehow interferes with the genetic message so that even a heterozygote with
one wildtype allele copy expresses the mutant phenotype One way in which the mutant allele can interfere is
by enhancing the function of the wildtype gene product or changing its distribution in the body One example
of this is the Antennapedia mutation in Drosophila Figure 129 In this case the mutant allele expands the
distribution of the gene product and as a result the Antennapedia heterozygote develops legs on its head where
its antennae should be
Figure 129 As seen in comparing the wildtype Drosophila left and the Antennapedia mutant right the
Antennapedia mutant has legs on its head in place of antennae
