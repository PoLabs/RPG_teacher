VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS
1 Figure 165 In E coli the trp operon is on by
default while the lac operon is off Why do you think
that this is the case
2 Figure 167 In females one of the two X
chromosomes is inactivated during embryonic
development because of epigenetic changes to the
chromatin What impact do you think these changes
would have on nucleosome packing
3 Figure 1613 An increase in phosphorylation
levels of eIF2 has been observed in patients with
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers
Parkinsons and Huntingtons What impact do you
think this might have on protein synthesis
REVIEW QUESTIONS
4 Control of gene expression in eukaryotic cells
occurs at which levels
a
only the transcriptional level
b
epigenetic and transcriptional levels
c
epigenetic transcriptional and translational
levels
d
epigenetic transcriptional post
transcriptional translational and post
translational levels
5 Posttranslational control refers to
a
regulation of gene expression after
transcription
b
regulation of gene expression after
translation
c
control of epigenetic activation
d
period between transcription and translation
6 How does the regulation of gene expression
support continued evolution of more complex
organisms
a
Cells can become specialized within a
multicellular organism
b
Organisms can conserve energy and
resources
c
Cells grow larger to accommodate protein
production
d
Both A and B
7 If glucose is absent but so is lactose the lac
operon will be ________
a
activated
b
repressed
c
activated but only partially
d
mutated
8 Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus Therefore the
genes in prokaryotic cells are
a
all expressed all of the time
b
transcribed and translated almost
simultaneously
c
transcriptionally controlled because
translation begins before transcription ends
d
b and c are both true
9 The ara operon is an inducible operon that controls
the production of the sugar arabinose When
arabinose is present in a bacterium it binds to the
protein AraC and the complex binds to the initiator
site to promote transcription In this scenario AraC is
an ________
a
activator
b
inducer
c
repressor
d
operator
10 What are epigenetic modifications
a
the addition of reversible changes to histone
proteins and DNA
b
the removal of nucleosomes from the DNA
c
the addition of more nucleosomes to the
DNA
d
mutation of the DNA sequence
11 Which of the following are true of epigenetic
changes
a
allow DNA to be transcribed
b
move histones to open or close a
chromosomal region
c
are temporary
d
all of the above
12 The binding of ________ is required for
transcription to start
a
a protein
b
DNA polymerase
c
RNA polymerase
d
a transcription factor
13 What will result from the binding of a transcription
factor to an enhancer region
a
decreased transcription of an adjacent gene
b
increased transcription of a distant gene
c
alteration of the translation of an adjacent
gene
d
initiation of the recruitment of RNA
polymerase
14 A scientist compares the promoter regions of two
genes Gene As core promoter plus proximal
promoter elements encompasses 70bp Gene Bs
core promoter plus proximal promoter elements
encompasses 250bp Which of the scientists
hypotheses is most likely to be correct
