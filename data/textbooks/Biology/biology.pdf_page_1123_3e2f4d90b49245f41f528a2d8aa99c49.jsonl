JustNoticeable Difference
It is easy to differentiate between a onepound bag of rice and a twopound bag of rice There is a one
pound difference and one bag is twice as heavy as the other However would it be as easy to differentiate
between a 20 and a 21pound bag
Question What is the smallest detectible weight difference between a onepound bag of rice and a larger
bag What is the smallest detectible difference between a 20pound bag and a larger bag In both cases
at what weights are the differences detected This smallest detectible difference in stimuli is known as the
justnoticeable difference JND
Background Research background literature on JND and on Webers Law a description of a proposed
mathematical relationship between the overall magnitude of the stimulus and the JND You will be testing
JND of different weights of rice in bags Choose a convenient increment that is to be stepped through while
testing For example you could choose 10 percent increments between one and two pounds 11 12 13
14 and so on or 20 percent increments 12 14 16 and 18
Hypothesis Develop a hypothesis about JND in terms of percentage of the whole weight being tested
such as the JND between the two small bags and between the two large bags is proportionally the same
or    is not proportionally the same So for the first hypothesis if the JND between the onepound
bag and a larger bag is 02 pounds that is 20 percent 10 pound feels the same as 11 pounds but 10
pound feels less than 12 pounds then the JND between the 20pound bag and a larger bag will also be
20 percent So 20 pounds feels the same as 22 pounds or 23 pounds but 20 pounds feels less than 24
pounds
Test the hypothesis Enlist 24 participants and split them into two groups of 12 To set up the
demonstration assuming a 10 percent increment was selected have the first group be the onepound
group As a counterbalancing measure against a systematic error however six of the first group will
compare one pound to two pounds and step down in weight 10 to 20 10 to 19 and so on while the
other six will step up 10 to 11 10 to 12 and so on Apply the same principle to the 20pound group 20
to 40 20 to 38 and so on and 20 to 22 20 to 24 and so on Given the large difference between 20 and 40
pounds you may wish to use 30 pounds as your larger weight In any case use two weights that are easily
detectable as different
Record the observations Record the data in a table similar to the table below For the onepound and
20pound groups base weights record a plus sign  for each participant that detects a difference between
the base weight and the step weight Record a minus sign  for each participant that finds no difference If
onetenth steps were not used then replace the steps in the Step Weight columns with the step you are
using
