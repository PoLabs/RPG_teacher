Figure 3610 a Foliate circumvallate and fungiform papillae are located on different regions of the tongue b Foliate
papillae are prominent protrusions on this light micrograph credit a modification of work by NCI scalebar data from

In addition to those two types of chemically and mechanically sensitive papillae are foliate papillaeleaflike
papillae located in parallel folds along the edges and toward the back of the tongue as seen in the Figure 3610
micrograph Foliate papillae contain about 1300 taste buds within their folds Finally there are circumvallate
papillae which are walllike papillae in the shape of an inverted V at the back of the tongue Each of these
papillae is surrounded by a groove and contains about 250 taste buds
Each taste buds taste cells are replaced every 10 to 14 days These are elongated cells with hairlike processes
called microvilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore illustrated in Figure 3611 Food molecules 
tastants are dissolved in saliva and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli The receptors
for tastants are located across the outer portion and front of the tongue outside of the middle area where the
filiform papillae are most prominent
