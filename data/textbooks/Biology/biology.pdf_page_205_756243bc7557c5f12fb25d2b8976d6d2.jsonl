transition state highenergy unstable state an intermediate form between the substrate and the product
occurring during a chemical reaction
CHAPTER SUMMARY
61 Energy and Metabolism
Cells perform the functions of life through various chemical reactions A cells metabolism refers to the chemical
reactions that take place within it There are metabolic reactions that involve breaking down complex chemicals
into simpler ones such as breaking down large macromolecules Scientists refer to this process as catabolism
and we associate such reactions an energy release On the other end of the spectrum anabolism refers to
metabolic processes that build complex molecules out of simpler ones such as macromolecule synthesis
Anabolic processes require energy Glucose synthesis and glucose breakdown are examples of anabolic and
catabolic pathways respectively
62 Potential Kinetic Free and Activation Energy
Energy comes in many different forms Objects in motion do physical work and kinetic energy is the energy of
objects in motion Objects that are not in motion may have the potential to do work and thus have potential
energy Molecules also have potential energy because breaking molecular bonds has the potential to release
energy Living cells depend on harvesting potential energy from molecular bonds to perform work Free energy
is a measure of energy that is available to do work A systems free energy changes during energy transfers
such as chemical reactions and scientists refer to this change as G
A reactions G can be negative or positive meaning that the reaction releases energy or consumes energy
respectively A reaction with a negative G that gives off energy is an exergonic reaction One with a positive
G that requires energy input is an endergonic reaction Exergonic reactions are spontaneous because their
products have less energy than their reactants Endergonic reactions products have a higher energy state than
the reactants and so these are nonspontaneous reactions However all reactions including spontaneous G
reactions require an initial energy input in order to reach the transition state at which they will proceed This
initial input of energy is the activation energy
63 The Laws of Thermodynamics
In studying energy scientists use the term system to refer to the matter and its environment involved in
energy transfers Everything outside of the system is the surroundings Single cells are biological systems We
can think of systems as having a certain amount of order It takes energy to make a system more ordered The
more ordered a system the lower its entropy Entropy is a measure of a systems disorder As a system
becomes more disordered the lower its energy and the higher its entropy
The laws of thermodynamics are a series of laws that describe the properties and processes of energy transfer
The first law states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant This means that energy cannot
be created or destroyed only transferred or transformed The second law of thermodynamics states that every
energy transfer involves some loss of energy in an unusable form such as heat energy resulting in a more
disordered system In other words no energy transfer is completely efficient and all transfers trend toward
disorder
64 ATP Adenosine Triphosphate
ATP is the primary energysupplying molecule for living cells ATP is comprised of a nucleotide a fivecarbon
sugar and three phosphate groups The bonds that connect the phosphates phosphoanhydride bonds have
highenergy content The energy released from ATP hydrolysis into ADP  Pi performs cellular work Cells use
ATP to perform work by coupling ATP hydrolysis exergonic reaction with endergonic reactions ATP donates its
phosphate group to another molecule via phosphorylation The phosphorylated molecule is at a higherenergy
state and is less stable than its unphosphorylated form and this added energy from phosphate allows the
molecule to undergo its endergonic reaction
65 Enzymes
Enzymes are chemical catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions at physiological temperatures by lowering
their activation energy Enzymes are usually proteins consisting of one or more polypeptide chains Enzymes
