Figure 4224 Antibodies may inhibit infection by a preventing the antigen from binding its target b tagging a
pathogen for destruction by macrophages or neutrophils or c activating the complement cascade
Antibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells such as macrophages or neutrophils
because phagocytic cells are highly attracted to macromolecules complexed with antibodies Phagocytic
enhancement by antibodies is called opsonization In a process called complement fixation IgM and IgG in
serum bind to antigens and provide docking sites onto which sequential complement proteins can bind The
combination of antibodies and complement enhances opsonization even further and promotes rapid clearing of
pathogens
Affinity Avidity and Cross Reactivity
Not all antibodies bind with the same strength specificity and stability In fact antibodies exhibit different
affinities attraction depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules as
illustrated in Figure 4225 An antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and
stably and thus would be expected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen corresponding
to the specific antigen
