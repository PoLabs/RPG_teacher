Physiological Processes in Sponges
Sponges despite being simple organisms regulate their different physiological processes through a variety of
mechanisms These processes regulate their metabolism reproduction and locomotion
Digestion
Sponges lack complex digestive respiratory circulatory and nervous systems Their food is trapped as water
passes through the ostia and out through the osculum Bacteria smaller than 05 microns in size are trapped
by choanocytes which are the principal cells engaged in feeding and are ingested by phagocytosis However
particles that are larger than the ostia may be phagocytized at the sponges surface by pinacocytes In some
sponges amoebocytes transport food from cells that have ingested food particles to those that do not In
sponges in spite of what looks like a large digestive cavity all digestion is intracellular The limit of this type of
digestion is that food particles must be smaller than individual sponge cells
All other major body functions in the sponge gas exchange circulation excretion are performed by diffusion
between the cells that line the openings within the sponge and the water that is passing through those openings
All cell types within the sponge obtain oxygen from water through diffusion Likewise carbon dioxide is released
into seawater by diffusion In addition nitrogenous waste produced as a byproduct of protein metabolism is
excreted via diffusion by individual cells into the water as it passes through the sponge
Some sponges host green algae or cyanobacteria as endosymbionts within archeocytes and other cells It may
be a surprise to learn that there are nearly 150 species of carnivorous sponges which feed primarily on tiny
crustaceans snaring them through sticky threads or hooked spicules
Although there is no specialized nervous system in sponges there is intercellular communication that can
regulate events like contraction of the sponges body or the activity of the choanocytes
Reproduction
Sponges reproduce by sexual as well as asexual methods The typical means of asexual reproduction is either
fragmentation during this process a piece of the sponge breaks off settles on a new substrate and develops
into a new individual or budding a genetically identical outgrowth grows from the parent and eventually
detaches or remains attached to form a colony An atypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in
freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation of gemmules Gemmules are environmentally resistant
