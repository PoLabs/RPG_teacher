a condition where the feces are hardened because of excess water removal in the colon In contrast if enough
water is not removed from the feces it results in diarrhea Many bacteria including the ones that cause cholera
affect the proteins involved in water reabsorption in the colon and result in excessive diarrhea
Emesis
Emesis or vomiting is elimination of food by forceful expulsion through the mouth It is often in response to an
irritant that affects the digestive tract including but not limited to viruses bacteria emotions sights and food
poisoning This forceful expulsion of the food is due to the strong contractions produced by the stomach muscles
The process of emesis is regulated by the medulla
344  Digestive System Regulation
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the role of neural regulation in digestive processes

Explain how hormones regulate digestion
The brain is the control center for the sensation of hunger and satiety The functions of the digestive system are
regulated through neural and hormonal responses
Neural Responses to Food
In reaction to the smell sight or thought of food like that shown in Figure 3420 the first response is that of
salivation The salivary glands secrete more saliva in response to stimulation by the autonomic nervous system
triggered by food in preparation for digestion Simultaneously the stomach begins to produce hydrochloric acid
to digest the food Recall that the peristaltic movements of the esophagus and other organs of the digestive tract
are under the control of the brain The brain prepares these muscles for movement as well When the stomach
is full the part of the brain that detects satiety signals fullness There are three overlapping phases of gastric
controlthe cephalic phase the gastric phase and the intestinal phaseeach requires many enzymes and is
under neural control as well

stomach credit Kelly Bailey
Digestive Phases
The response to food begins even before food enters the mouth The first phase of ingestion called the cephalic
phase is controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food All aspectssuch as sight sense
and smelltrigger the neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices The gastric and
salivary secretion in the cephalic phase can also take place due to the thought of food Right now if you think
