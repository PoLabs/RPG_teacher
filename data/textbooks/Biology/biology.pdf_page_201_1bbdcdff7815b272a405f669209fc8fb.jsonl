Drug Discovery by Looking for Inhibitors of Key Enzymes in
Specific Pathways
Enzymes are key components of metabolic pathways Understanding how enzymes work and how they can
be regulated is a key principle behind developing many pharmaceutical drugs Figure 619 on the market
today Biologists working in this field collaborate with other scientists usually chemists to design drugs
Consider statins for examplewhich is a class of drugs that reduces cholesterol levels These compounds
are essentially inhibitors of the enzyme HMGCoA reductase HMGCoA reductase is the enzyme that
synthesizes cholesterol from lipids in the body By inhibiting this enzyme the drug reduces cholesterol levels
synthesized in the body Similarly acetaminophen popularly marketed under the brand name Tylenol is an
inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase While it is effective in providing relief from fever and inflammation
pain scientists still do not completely understand its mechanism of action
How are drugs developed One of the first challenges in drug development is identifying the specific
molecule that the drug is intended to target In the case of statins HMGCoA reductase is the drug target
Researchers identify targets through painstaking research in the laboratory Identifying the target alone
is not sufficient Scientists also need to know how the target acts inside the cell and which reactions go
awry in the case of disease Once researchers identify the target and the pathway then the actual drug
design process begins During this stage chemists and biologists work together to design and synthesize
molecules that can either block or activate a particular reaction However this is only the beginning both if
and when a drug prototype is successful in performing its function then it must undergo many tests from in
vitro experiments to clinical trials before it can obtain FDA approval to be on the market
Many enzymes dont work optimally or even at all unless bound to other specific nonprotein helper molecules
either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds Two types
of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes Binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation
and function for their respective enzymes Cofactors are inorganic ions such as iron Fe and magnesium
Mg One example of an enzyme that requires a metal ion as a cofactor is the enzyme that builds DNA
molecules DNA polymerase which requires a bound zinc ion Zn to function Coenzymes are organic
helper molecules with a basic atomic structure comprised of carbon and hydrogen which are required for
enzyme action The most common sources of coenzymes are dietary vitamins Figure 620 Some vitamins are
precursors to coenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes Vitamin C is a coenzyme for multiple enzymes
that take part in building the important connective tissue component collagen An important step in breaking
down glucose to yield energy is catalysis by a multienzyme complex scientists call pyruvate dehydrogenase
Pyruvate dehydrogenase is a complex of several enzymes that actually requires one cofactor a magnesium ion
and five different organic coenzymes to catalyze its specific chemical reaction Therefore enzyme function is in
part regulated by an abundance of various cofactors and coenzymes which the diets of most organisms supply
