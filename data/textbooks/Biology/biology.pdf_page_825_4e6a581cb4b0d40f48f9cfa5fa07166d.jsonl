A key characteristic of some gastropods is the embryonic development of torsion During this process the
mantle and visceral mass are rotated around the perpendicular axis over the center of the foot to bring the anal
opening forward just behind the head Figure 2825 creating a very peculiar situation The left gill kidney and
heart atrium are now on the right side whereas the original right gill kidney and heart atrium are on the left
side Even stranger the nerve cords have been twisted and contorted into a figureeight pattern Because of the
space made available by torsion in the mantle cavity the animals sensitive head end can now be withdrawn into
the protection of the shell and the tougher foot and sometimes the protective covering or operculum forms a
barrier to the outside The strange arrangement that results from torsion poses a serious sanitation problem by
creating the possibility of wastes being washed back over the gills causing fouling There is actually no really
perfect explanation for the embryonic development of torsion and some groups that formerly exhibited torsion
in their ancestral groups are now known to have reversed the process
Gastropods also have a foot that is modified for crawling Most gastropods have a welldefined head with
tentacles and eyes A complex radula is used to scrape up food particles In aquatic gastropods the mantle
cavity encloses the gills ctenidia but in land gastropods the mantle itself is the major respiratory structure
acting as a kind of lung Nephridia kidneys are also found in the mantle cavity
Figure 2825 Torsion in gastropods During embryonic development of some gastropods the visceral mass undergoes
torsion or counterclockwise rotation of the visceral anatomical features As a result the anus of the adult animal is
located over the head Although torsion is always counterclockwise the shell may coil in either direction thus coiling
of a shell is not the same as torsion of the visceral mass
