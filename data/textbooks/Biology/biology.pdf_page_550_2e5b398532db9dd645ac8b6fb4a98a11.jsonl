Classification Levels
Taxonomy which literally means arrangement law is the science of classifying organisms to construct
internationally shared classification systems with each organism placed into increasingly more inclusive
groupings Think about a grocery stores organization One large space is divided into departments such as
produce dairy and meats Then each department further divides into aisles then each aisle into categories
and brands and then finally a single product We call this organization from larger to smaller more specific
categories a hierarchical system
The taxonomic classification system also called the Linnaean system after its inventor Carl Linnaeus a
Swedish botanist zoologist and physician uses a hierarchical model Moving from the point of origin the groups
become more specific until one branch ends as a single species For example after the common beginning of
all life scientists divide organisms into three large categories called domains Bacteria Archaea and Eukarya
Within each domain is a second category called a kingdom After kingdoms the subsequent categories of
increasing specificity are phylum class order family genus and species Figure 205
Figure 205 The taxonomic classification system uses a hierarchical model to organize living organisms into
increasingly specific categories The common dog Canis lupus familiaris is a subspecies of Canis lupus which also
includes the wolf and dingo credit dog modification of work by Janneke Vreugdenhil
The kingdom Animalia stems from the Eukarya domain Figure 205 above shows the classification for the
common dog Therefore the full name of an organism technically has eight terms For the dog it is Eukarya
Animalia Chordata Mammalia Carnivora Canidae Canis and lupus Notice that each name is capitalized
except for species and the genus and species names are italicized Scientists generally refer to an organism
only by its genus and species which is its twoword scientific name or binomial nomenclature Therefore the
scientific name of the dog is Canis lupus The name at each level is also a taxon In other words dogs are in
order Carnivora Carnivora is the name of the taxon at the order level Canidae is the taxon at the family level
and so forth Organisms also have a common name that people typically use in this case dog Note that the
dog is additionally a subspecies the familiaris in Canis lupus familiaris Subspecies are members of the same
species that are capable of mating and reproducing viable offspring but they are separate subspecies due to
geographic or behavioral isolation or other factors
Figure 206 shows how the levels move toward specificity with other organisms Notice how the dog shares a
domain with the widest diversity of organisms including plants and butterflies At each sublevel the organisms
become more similar because they are more closely related Historically scientists classified organisms using
characteristics but as DNA technology developed they have determined more precise phylogenies
