Figure 68 This figure shows some examples of endergonic processes ones that require energy and exergonic
processes ones that release energy These include a a compost pile decomposing b a chick developing
from a fertilized egg c sand art destruction and d a ball rolling down a hill credit a modification of work by

Look at each of the processes and decide if it is endergonic or exergonic In each case does enthalpy
increase or decrease and does entropy increase or decrease
An important concept in studying metabolism and energy is that of chemical equilibrium Most chemical reactions
are reversible They can proceed in both directions releasing energy into their environment in one direction and
absorbing it from the environment in the other direction Figure 69 The same is true for the chemical reactions
involved in cell metabolism such as the breaking down and building up of proteins into and from individual
amino acids respectively Reactants within a closed system will undergo chemical reactions in both directions
until they reach a state of equilibrium which is one of the lowest possible free energy and a state of maximal
entropy To push the reactants and products away from a state of equilibrium requires energy Either reactants
or products must be added removed or changed If a cell were a closed system its chemical reactions would
reach equilibrium and it would die because there would be insufficient free energy left to perform the necessary
work to maintain life In a living cell chemical reactions are constantly moving towards equilibrium but never
reach it This is because a living cell is an open system Materials pass in and out the cell recycles the products
of certain chemical reactions into other reactions and there is never chemical equilibrium In this way living
organisms are in a constant energyrequiring uphill battle against equilibrium and entropy This constant energy
supply ultimately comes from sunlight which produces nutrients in the photosynthesis process
