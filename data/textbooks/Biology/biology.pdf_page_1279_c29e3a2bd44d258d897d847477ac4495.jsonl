Blood flow through the capillary beds is regulated depending on the bodys needs and is directed by nerve and
hormone signals For example after a large meal most of the blood is diverted to the stomach by vasodilation
of vessels of the digestive system and vasoconstriction of other vessels During exercise blood is diverted
to the skeletal muscles through vasodilation while blood to the digestive system would be lessened through
vasoconstriction The blood entering some capillary beds is controlled by small muscles called precapillary
sphincters illustrated in Figure 4017 If the sphincters are open the blood will flow into the associated branches
of the capillary blood If all of the sphincters are closed then the blood will flow directly from the arteriole to the
venule through the thoroughfare channel see Figure 4017 These muscles allow the body to precisely control
when capillary beds receive blood flow At any given moment only about 510 of our capillary beds actually
have blood flowing through them
Figure 4017 a Precapillary sphincters are rings of smooth muscle that regulate the flow of blood through
capillaries they help control the location of blood flow to where it is needed b Valves in the veins prevent blood
from moving backward credit a modification of work by NCI
Varicose veins are veins that become enlarged because the valves no longer close properly allowing blood
to flow backward Varicose veins are often most prominent on the legs Why do you think this is the case

Proteins and other large solutes cannot leave the capillaries The loss of the watery plasma creates a
hyperosmotic solution within the capillaries especially near the venules This causes about 85 of the plasma
that leaves the capillaries to eventually diffuse back into the capillaries near the venules The remaining 15
of blood plasma drains out from the interstitial fluid into nearby lymphatic vessels Figure 4018 The fluid in
the lymph is similar in composition to the interstitial fluid The lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes before it
returns to the heart via the vena cava Lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation
through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells The white blood cells remove infectious agents
such as bacteria and viruses to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream After it is cleaned the
lymph returns to the heart by the action of smooth muscle pumping skeletal muscle action and oneway valves
joining the returning blood near the junction of the venae cavae entering the right atrium of the heart
