4316 ruptures and releases its egg The follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost The
level of estrogen decreases when the extra follicles degenerate

Following ovulation the ovarian cycle enters its luteal phase illustrated in Figure 4315 and the menstrual cycle
enters its secretory phase both of which run from about day 15 to 28 The luteal and secretory phases refer
to changes in the ruptured follicle The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure
called a corpus luteum The corpus luteum produces estrogen and progesterone The progesterone facilitates
the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of further FSH and LH The uterus is being prepared to
accept a fertilized egg should it occur during this cycle The inhibition of FSH and LH prevents any further eggs
and follicles from developing while the progesterone is elevated The level of estrogen produced by the corpus
luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days
If no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen and
progesterone decrease The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop initiating the
next menstrual cycle The decrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior
pituitary releasing FSH and LH and starting the cycles again Figure 4317 visually compares the ovarian and
uterine cycles as well as the commensurate hormone levels
