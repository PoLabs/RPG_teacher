KEY TERMS
gene variations that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous
chromosomes
any of the nonsex chromosomes
hypothetical inheritance pattern in which parental traits are blended together in
the offspring to produce an intermediate physical appearance
in a heterozygote complete and simultaneous expression of both alleles for the same
characteristic
inheritance pattern in which a character shows a range of trait values with small
gradations rather than large gaps between them
result of a cross between two truebreeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics
inheritance pattern in which traits are distinct and are transmitted independently of
one another
trait which confers the same physical appearance whether an individual has two copies of the trait or
one copy of the dominant trait and one copy of the recessive trait
inheritance pattern in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote
this allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age
antagonistic interaction between genes such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of
another
first filial generation in a cross the offspring of the parental generation
second filial generation produced when F1 individuals are selfcrossed or fertilized with each other
underlying genetic makeup consisting of both physically visible and nonexpressed alleles of an
organism
presence of only one allele for a characteristic as in Xlinkage hemizygosity makes descriptions
of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant
having two different alleles for a given gene on the homologous chromosome
having two identical alleles for a given gene on the homologous chromosome
process of mating two individuals that differ with the goal of achieving a certain characteristic in
their offspring
in a heterozygote expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual
displays an intermediate phenotype
in a heterozygote one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same
characteristic
genes do not influence each other with regard to sorting of alleles into
gametes every possible combination of alleles is equally likely to occur
paired unit factors ie genes segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an
equal likelihood of inheriting any combination of factors
phenomenon in which alleles that are located in close proximity to each other on the same chromosome
are more likely to be inherited together
