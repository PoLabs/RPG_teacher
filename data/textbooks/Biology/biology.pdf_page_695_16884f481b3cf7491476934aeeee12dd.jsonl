Fungi play a crucial role in the constantly changing balance of ecosystems They colonize most habitats on
Earth preferring dark moist conditions They can thrive in seemingly hostile environments such as the tundra
thanks to a most successful symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms like algae to produce lichens Within their
communities fungi are not as obvious as are large animals or tall treas Like bacteria they act behind the scene
as major decomposers With their versatile metabolism fungi break down organic matter which would otherwise
not be recycled
Habitats
Although fungi are primarily associated with humid and cool environments that provide a supply of organic
matter they colonize a surprising diversity of habitats from seawater to human skin and mucous membranes
Chytrids are found primarily in aquatic environments Other fungi such as Coccidioides immitis which causes
pneumonia when its spores are inhaled thrive in the dry and sandy soil of the southwestern United States
Fungi that parasitize coral reefs live in the ocean However most members of the Kingdom Fungi grow on the
forest floor where the dark and damp environment is rich in decaying debris from plants and animals In these
environments fungi play a major role as decomposers and recyclers making it possible for members of the
other kingdoms to be supplied with nutrients and live
Decomposers and Recyclers
The food web would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter Figure 2419 Some
elementssuch as nitrogen and phosphorusare required in large quantities by biological systems and yet
are not abundant in the environment The action of fungi releases these elements from decaying matter making
them available to other living organisms Trace elements present in low amounts in many habitats are essential
for growth and would remain tied up in rotting organic matter if fungi and bacteria did not return them to the
environment via their metabolic activity
Figure 2419 Bracket fungi Fungi are an important part of ecosystem nutrient cycles These bracket fungi growing on
the side of a tree are the fruiting structures of a basidiomycete They receive their nutrients through their hyphae which
invade and decay the tree trunk credit Cory Zanker
The ability of fungi to degrade many large and insoluble molecules is due to their mode of nutrition As seen
earlier digestion precedes ingestion Fungi produce a variety of exoenzymes to digest nutrients The enzymes
are either released into the substrate or remain bound to the outside of the fungal cell wall Large molecules are
broken down into small molecules which are transported into the cell by a system of protein carriers embedded
in the cell membrane Because the movement of small molecules and enzymes is dependent on the presence
of water active growth depends on a relatively high percentage of moisture in the environment
As saprobes fungi help maintain a sustainable ecosystem for the animals and plants that share the same
habitat In addition to replenishing the environment with nutrients fungi interact directly with other organisms in
beneficial and sometimes damaging ways Figure 2420
