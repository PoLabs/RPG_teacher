KEY TERMS
saclike structure at the tip of the stamen in which pollen grains are produced
phylum to which angiosperms belong
molecular biology technique in which one or more short gene sequences taken from a well
characterized portion of the genome is used to identify a species
a group of plants that probably branched off before the separation of monocots and
eudicots
whorl of sepals
single unit of the pistil
dominant phylum of gymnosperms with the greatest variety of trees
collection of petals
primitive leaf that develops in the zygote monocots have one cotyledon and dicots have two
cotyledons
cultivated plant
gymnosperm that grows in tropical climates and resembles a palm tree member of the phylum
Cycadophyta
also eudicot related group of angiosperms whose embryos possess two cotyledons
describes a species in which the male and female reproductive organs are carried on separate
specimens
thin stalk that links the anther to the base of the flower
branches specialized for reproduction found in some seedbearing plants containing either specialized
male or female organs or both male and female organs
thickened tissue derived from ovary wall that protects the embryo after fertilization and facilitates seed
dispersal
gymnosperm with one extant species the Ginkgo biloba a tree with fanshaped leaves
gymnosperm shrub with varied morphological features that produces vessel elements in its woody
tissues the phylum includes the genera Ephedra Gnetum and Welwitschia
seed plant with naked seeds seeds exposed on modified leaves or in cones
also carpel structure that constitutes the female reproductive organ
seed from a plant that was grown historically but has not been used in modern agriculture on a
large scale
grasslike plant noticeable by the absence of woody tissue
consumption of plants by insects and other animals
layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the megasporangium and later the embryo
megaspore mother cell larger spore that germinates into a female gametophyte in a
heterosporous plant
smaller spore that produces a male gametophyte in a heterosporous plant
