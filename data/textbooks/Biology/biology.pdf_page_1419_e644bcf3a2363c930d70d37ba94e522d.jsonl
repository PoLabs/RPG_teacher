Figure 452 Australian mammals show a typical inverse relationship between population density and body size
As this graph shows population density typically decreases with increasing body size Why do you think
this is the case
Population Research Methods
The most accurate way to determine population size is to simply count all of the individuals within the habitat
However this method is often not logistically or economically feasible especially when studying large habitats
Thus scientists usually study populations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat and using this
data to make inferences about the habitat as a whole A variety of methods can be used to sample populations
to determine their size and density For immobile organisms such as plants or for very small and slowmoving
organisms a quadrat may be used Figure 453 A quadrat is a way of marking off square areas within a
habitat either by staking out an area with sticks and string or by the use of a wood plastic or metal square
placed on the ground After setting the quadrats researchers then count the number of individuals that lie within
their boundaries Multiple quadrat samples are performed throughout the habitat at several random locations
to estimate the population size and density within the entire habitat The number and size of quadrat samples
depends on the type of organisms under study and other factors including the density of the organism For
example if sampling daffodils a 1 m2 quadrat might be used With giant redwoods on the other hand a larger
quadrat of 100 m2 might be employed This ensures that enough individuals of the species are counted to get
an accurate sample that correlates with the habitat including areas not sampled
