phyla are not closely related phylogenetically to each other Gnetophyta are considered the closest group to
angiosperms because they produce true xylem tissue with vessels as well as the tracheids found in the rest of
the gymnosperms It is possible that vessel elements arose independently in the two groups
Conifers Coniferophyta
Conifers are the dominant phylum of gymnosperms with the greatest variety of species Figure 269 Typical
conifers are tall trees that bear scalelike or needlelike leaves Water evaporation from leaves is reduced by their
narrow shape and a thick cuticle Snow easily slides off needleshaped leaves keeping the snow load light thus
reducing broken branches Such adaptations to cold and dry weather explain the predominance of conifers at
high altitudes and in cold climates Conifers include familiar evergreen trees such as pines spruces firs cedars
sequoias and yews A few species are deciduous and lose their leaves in fall The bald cypress dawn redwood
European larch and the tamarack Figure 269c are examples of deciduous conifers Many coniferous trees
are harvested for paper pulp and timber The wood of conifers is more primitive than the wood of angiosperms
it contains tracheids but no vessel elements and is therefore referred to as soft wood
Figure 269 Conifers Conifers are the dominant form of vegetation in cold or arid environments and at high altitudes

Cycads
Cycads thrive in mild climates and are often mistaken for palms because of the shape of their large compound
leaves Cycads bear large strobili or cones Figure 2610 and may be pollinated by beetles rather than wind
which is unusual for a gymnosperm Large cycads dominated the landscape during the age of dinosaurs in the
Mesozoic but only a hundred or so smaller species persisted to modern times They face possible extinction
and several species are protected through international conventions Because of their attractive shape they are
often used as ornamental plants in gardens in the tropics and subtropics
