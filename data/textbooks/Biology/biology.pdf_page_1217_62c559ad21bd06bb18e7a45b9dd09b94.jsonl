Figure 3833 The body contains three types of muscle tissue skeletal muscle smooth muscle and cardiac muscle
visualized here using light microscopy Smooth muscle cells are short tapered at each end and have only one plump
nucleus in each Cardiac muscle cells are branched and striated but short The cytoplasm may branch and they have
one nucleus in the center of the cell credit modification of work by NCI NIH scalebar data from Matt Russell
Skeletal muscle tissue forms skeletal muscles which attach to bones or skin and control locomotion and
any movement that can be consciously controlled Because it can be controlled by thought skeletal muscle is
also called voluntary muscle Skeletal muscles are long and cylindrical in appearance when viewed under a
microscope skeletal muscle tissue has a striped or striated appearance The striations are caused by the regular
arrangement of contractile proteins actin and myosin Actin is a globular contractile protein that interacts with
myosin for muscle contraction Skeletal muscle also has multiple nuclei present in a single cell
Smooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines stomach and urinary
bladder and around passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels Smooth muscle has no striations
is not under voluntary control has only one nucleus per cell is tapered at both ends and is called involuntary
muscle
Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart and cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the body
and maintain blood pressure Like skeletal muscle cardiac muscle is striated but unlike skeletal muscle cardiac
muscle cannot be consciously controlled and is called involuntary muscle It has one nucleus per cell is
branched and is distinguished by the presence of intercalated disks
Skeletal Muscle Fiber Structure
Each skeletal muscle fiber is a skeletal muscle cell These cells are incredibly large with diameters of up to 100
m and lengths of up to 30 cm The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is called the sarcolemma
The sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction which triggers muscle contraction Within each muscle
fiber are myofibrilslong cylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber Myofibrils run the entire
length of the muscle fiber and because they are only approximately 12 m in diameter hundreds to thousands
can be found inside one muscle fiber They attach to the sarcolemma at their ends so that as myofibrils shorten
the entire muscle cell contracts Figure 3834
Figure 3834 A skeletal muscle cell is surrounded by a plasma membrane called the sarcolemma with a cytoplasm
called the sarcoplasm A muscle fiber is composed of many fibrils packaged into orderly units
The striated appearance of skeletal muscle tissue is a result of repeating bands of the proteins actin and myosin
that are present along the length of myofibrils Dark A bands and light I bands repeat along myofibrils and the
alignment of myofibrils in the cell causes the entire cell to appear striated or banded
