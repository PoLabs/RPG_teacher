Figure 3615 The hair cell is a mechanoreceptor with an array of stereocilia emerging from its apical surface The
stereocilia are tethered together by proteins that open ion channels when the array is bent toward the tallest member
of their array and closed when the array is bent toward the shortest member of their array
The hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way The basilar membrane vibrates in
different regions according to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it Likewise the hair cells that
lay above it are most sensitive to a specific frequency of sound waves Hair cells can respond to a small range
of similar frequencies but they require stimulation of greater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their
optimal range The difference in response frequency between adjacent inner hair cells is about 02 percent
Compare that to adjacent piano strings which are about six percent different Place theory which is the model
for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear states that high frequency sounds selectively
vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port the oval window Lower frequencies travel
farther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane The basic pitchdetermining
mechanism is based on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated The place theory is
the first step toward an understanding of pitch perception Considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human
ear it is thought that there must be some auditory sharpening mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution
When sound waves produce fluid waves inside the cochlea the basilar membrane flexes bending the stereocilia
that attach to the tectorial membrane Their bending results in action potentials in the hair cells and auditory
information travels along the neural endings of the bipolar neurons of the hair cells collectively the auditory
nerve to the brain When the hairs bend they release an excitatory neurotransmitter at a synapse with a
sensory neuron which then conducts action potentials to the central nervous system The cochlear branch of the
vestibulocochlear cranial nerve sends information on hearing The auditory system is very refined and there is
some modulation or sharpening built in The brain can send signals back to the cochlea resulting in a change
of length in the outer hair cells sharpening or dampening the hair cells response to certain frequencies
