As weve seen most sponges are supported by small bonelike spicules usually tiny pointed structures made
of calcium carbonate or silica in the mesohyl Spicules provide support for the body of the sponge and may
also deter predation The presence and composition of spicules form the basis for differentiating three of the
four classes of sponges Figure 284 Sponges in class Calcarea produce calcium carbonate spicules and no
spongin those in class Hexactinellida produce sixrayed siliceous glassy spicules and no spongin and those in
class Demospongia contain spongin and may or may not have spicules if present those spicules are siliceous
Sponges in this last class have been used as bath sponges Spicules are most conspicuously present in the
glass sponges class Hexactinellida Some of the spicules may attain gigantic proportions For example relative
to typical glass sponge spicules whose size generally ranges from 3 to 10 mm some of the basal spicules of
the hexactinellid Monorhaphis chuni are enormous and grow up to 3 meters long The glass sponges are also
unusual in that most of their body cells are fused together to form a multinucleate syncytium Because their
cells are interconnected in this way the hexactinellid sponges have no mesohyl A fourth class of sponges the
Sclerospongiae was described from species discovered in underwater tunnels These are also called coralline
sponges after their multilayered calcium carbonate skeletons Dating based on the rate of deposition of the
