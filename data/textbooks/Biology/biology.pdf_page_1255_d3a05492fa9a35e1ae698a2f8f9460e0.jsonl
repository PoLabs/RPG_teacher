KEY TERMS
partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli usually around 100 mmHg
duct that extends from the terminal bronchiole to the alveolar sac
structure consisting of two or more alveoli that share a common opening
how much air is in the alveoli
plural alveoli also air sac terminal region of the lung where gas exchange occurs
also anatomical shunt region of the lung that lacks proper ventilationperfusion due
to an anatomical block
ion created when carbonic acid dissociates into H and HCO3

system in the blood that absorbs carbon dioxide and regulates pH levels
airway that extends from the main tertiary bronchi to the alveolar sac
plural bronchi smaller branch of cartilaginous tissue that stems off of the trachea air is funneled
through the bronchi to the region where gas exchange occurs in alveoli
molecule that forms when carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin
enzyme that catalyzes carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid
exchange of chloride for bicarbonate into or out of the red blood cell
measurement of the elasticity of the lung
area in the lung that lacks proper ventilation or perfusion
domedshaped skeletal muscle located under lungs that separates the thoracic cavity from the
abdominal cavity
property of the lung that drives the lung tissue inward
work conducted by the intercostal muscles chest wall and diaphragm
amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation
ratio of how much air can be forced out of the lung in one second to the total amount that is
forced out of the lung a measurement of lung function that can be used to detect disease states
work of breathing performed by the alveoli and tissues in the lung
also forced vital capacity measure of how much air can be forced out of the
lung from maximal inspiration over a specific amount of time
expiratory reserve volume plus residual volume
amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after taking the deepest breath
possible
centralized ironcontaining group that is surrounded by the alpha and beta subunits of hemoglobin
molecule in red blood cells that can bind oxygen carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
tidal volume plus inspiratory reserve volume
amount of additional air that can be inspired after a normal inhalation
