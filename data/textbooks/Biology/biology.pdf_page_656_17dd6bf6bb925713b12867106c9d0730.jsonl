The previous supergroups are all the products of primary endosymbiontic events and their organellesnucleus
mitochondria and chloroplastsare what would be considered typical ie matching the diagrams you would
find in an introductory biology book The next three supergroups all contain at least some photosynthetic
members whose chloroplasts were derived by secondary endosymbiosis They also show some interesting
variations in nuclear structure and modification of mitochondria or chloroplasts
Rhizaria
The Rhizaria supergroup includes many of the amoebas with thin threadlike needlelike or rootlike pseudopodia
Figure 2317 rather than the broader lobed pseudopodia of the Amoebozoa Many rhizarians make elaborate
and beautiful testsarmorlike coverings for the body of the cellcomposed of calcium carbonate silicon
or strontium salts Rhizarians have important roles in both carbon and nitrogen cycles When rhizarians die
and their tests sink into deep water the carbonates are out of reach of most decomposers locking carbon
dioxide away from the atmosphere In general this process by which carbon is transported deep into the ocean
is described as the biological carbon pump because carbon is pumped to the ocean depths where it is
inaccessible to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide The biological carbon pump is a crucial component of the
carbon cycle that maintains lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels Foraminiferans are unusual in that they are
the only eukaryotes known to participate in the nitrogen cycle by denitrification an activity usually served only
by prokaryotes
