Figure 3315 a Compact bone is a dense matrix on the outer surface of bone Spongy bone inside the compact
bone is porous with weblike trabeculae b Compact bone is organized into rings called osteons Blood vessels
nerves and lymphatic vessels are found in the central Haversian canal Rings of lamellae surround the Haversian
canal Between the lamellae are cavities called lacunae Canaliculi are microchannels connecting the lacunae together
c Osteoblasts surround the exterior of the bone Osteoclasts bore tunnels into the bone and osteocytes are found in
the lacunae
Adipose Tissue
Adipose tissue or fat tissue is considered a connective tissue even though it does not have fibroblasts or a
real matrix and only has a few fibers Adipose tissue is made up of cells called adipocytes that collect and
store fat in the form of triglycerides for energy metabolism Adipose tissues additionally serve as insulation to
help maintain body temperatures allowing animals to be endothermic and they function as cushioning against
damage to body organs Under a microscope adipose tissue cells appear empty due to the extraction of fat
during the processing of the material for viewing as seen in Figure 3316 The thin lines in the image are the
cell membranes and the nuclei are the small black dots at the edges of the cells
