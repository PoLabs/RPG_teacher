Introduction
In the 1980s biologists working in Lake Victoria in Africa discovered one of the most extraordinary products
of evolution on the planet Located in the Great Rift Valley Lake Victoria is an enormous and deep lake about
68900 km2 in area larger than Lake Huron the second largest of North Americas Great Lakes Biologists were
studying species of a family of fish called cichlids When they sampled for fish in different locations of the lake
the researchers identified over 500 evolved species in total However the scientists soon discovered that the
invasive Nile Perch was destroying the lakes cichlid population bringing hundreds of cichlid species to extinction
with devastating rapidity
