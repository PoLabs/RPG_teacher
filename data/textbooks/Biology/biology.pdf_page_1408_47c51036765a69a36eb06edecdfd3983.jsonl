Figure 4427 Ice at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica was laid down over the course of 420000 years and
reached a depth of over 3000 m By measuring the amount of CO2 trapped in the ice scientists have determined past
atmospheric CO2 concentrations Temperatures relative to modern day were determined from the amount of deuterium
a nonradioactive isotope of hydrogen present
Figure 4427a does not show the last 2000 years with enough detail to compare the changes of Earths
temperature during the last 400000 years with the temperature change that has occurred in the more recent
past Two significant temperature anomalies or irregularities have occurred in the last 2000 years These
are the Medieval Climate Anomaly or the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age A third temperature
anomaly aligns with the Industrial Era The Medieval Climate Anomaly occurred between 900 and 1300 AD
During this time period many climate scientists think that slightly warmer weather conditions prevailed in many
parts of the world the higherthanaverage temperature changes varied between 010 C and 020 C above the
norm Although 010 C does not seem large enough to produce any noticeable change it did free seas of ice
Because of this warming the Vikings were able to colonize Greenland
The Little Ice Age was a cold period that occurred between 1550 AD and 1850 AD During this time a slight
cooling of a little less than 1 C was observed in North America Europe and possibly other areas of the Earth
This 1 C change in global temperature is a seemingly small deviation in temperature as was observed during
the Medieval Climate Anomaly however it also resulted in noticeable climatic changes Historical accounts
reveal a time of exceptionally harsh winters with much snow and frost
The Industrial Revolution which began around 1750 was characterized by changes in much of human society
Advances in agriculture increased the food supply which improved the standard of living for people in Europe
and the United States New technologies were invented that provided jobs and cheaper goods These new
technologies were powered using fossil fuels especially coal The Industrial Revolution starting in the early
nineteenth century ushered in the beginning of the Industrial Era When a fossil fuel is burned carbon dioxide is
released With the beginning of the Industrial Era atmospheric carbon dioxide began to rise Figure 4428
