Ethylene is widely used in agriculture Commercial fruit growers control the timing of fruit ripening with application
of the gas Horticulturalists inhibit leaf dropping in ornamental plants by removing ethylene from greenhouses
using fans and ventilation
Nontraditional Hormones
Recent research has discovered a number of compounds that also influence plant development Their roles are
less understood than the effects of the major hormones described so far
Jasmonates play a major role in defense responses to herbivory Their levels increase when a plant is wounded
by a predator resulting in an increase in toxic secondary metabolites They contribute to the production of volatile
compounds that attract natural enemies of predators For example chewing of tomato plants by caterpillars
leads to an increase in jasmonic acid levels which in turn triggers the release of volatile compounds that attract
predators of the pest
Oligosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections They act locally at the
site of injury and can also be transported to other tissues Strigolactones promote seed germination in some
species and inhibit lateral apical development in the absence of auxins Strigolactones also play a role in the
establishment of mycorrhizae a mutualistic association of plant roots and fungi Brassinosteroids are important
to many developmental and physiological processes Signals between these compounds and other hormones
notably auxin and GAs amplifies their physiological effect Apical dominance seed germination gravitropism
and resistance to freezing are all positively influenced by hormones Root growth and fruit dropping are inhibited
by steroids
Plant Responses to Wind and Touch
The shoot of a pea plant winds around a trellis while a tree grows on an angle in response to strong prevailing
winds These are examples of how plants respond to touch or wind
The movement of a plant subjected to constant directional pressure is called thigmotropism from the Greek
words thigma meaning touch and tropism implying direction Tendrils are one example of this The
meristematic region of tendrils is very touch sensitive light touch will evoke a quick coiling response Cells in
contact with a support surface contract whereas cells on the opposite side of the support expand Figure 3014
Application of jasmonic acid is sufficient to trigger tendril coiling without a mechanical stimulus
A thigmonastic response is a touch response independent of the direction of stimulus Figure 3024 In the
Venus flytrap two modified leaves are joined at a hinge and lined with thin forklike tines along the outer edges
Tiny hairs are located inside the trap When an insect brushes against these trigger hairs touching two or more
of them in succession the leaves close quickly trapping the prey Glands on the leaf surface secrete enzymes
that slowly digest the insect The released nutrients are absorbed by the leaves which reopen for the next meal
Thigmomorphogenesis is a slow developmental change in the shape of a plant subjected to continuous
mechanical stress When trees bend in the wind for example growth is usually stunted and the trunk thickens
Strengthening tissue especially xylem is produced to add stiffness to resist the winds force Researchers
hypothesize that mechanical strain induces growth and differentiation to strengthen the tissues Ethylene and
jasmonate are likely involved in thigmomorphogenesis

Defense Responses against Herbivores and Pathogens
Plants face two types of enemies herbivores and pathogens Herbivores both large and small use plants as
food and actively chew them Pathogens are agents of disease These infectious microorganisms such as
fungi bacteria and nematodes live off of the plant and damage its tissues Plants have developed a variety of
strategies to discourage or kill attackers
