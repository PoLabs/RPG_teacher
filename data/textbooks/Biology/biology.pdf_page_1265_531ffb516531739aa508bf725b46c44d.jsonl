back to the heart which is called pulmonary circulation and the other throughout the rest of the body and
its organs including the brain systemic circulation In amphibians gas exchange also occurs through the skin
during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation
As shown in Figure 404b amphibians have a threechambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle
rather than the twochambered heart of fish The two atria superior heart chambers receive blood from the two
different circuits the lungs and the systems and then there is some mixing of the blood in the hearts ventricle
inferior heart chamber which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation The advantage to this arrangement is that
high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the
ventricle that diverts oxygenrich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the
pulmocutaneous circuit For this reason amphibians are often described as having double circulation
Most reptiles also have a threechambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the
pulmonary and systemic circuits as shown in Figure 404c The ventricle is divided more effectively by a
partial septum which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood Some reptiles alligators
and crocodiles are the most primitive animals to exhibit a fourchambered heart Crocodilians have a unique
circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during
long periods of submergence for instance while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to
rot One adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart one takes blood to the lungs
and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body Two other adaptations
include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles called the foramen of Panizza which allows blood to
move from one side of the heart to the other and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the
lungs Together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful
animal groups on earth
In mammals and birds the heart is also divided into four chambers two atria and two ventricles as illustrated in
Figure 404d The oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood which improves the efficiency
of double circulation and is probably required for the warmblooded lifestyle of mammals and birds The four
chambered heart of birds and mammals evolved independently from a threechambered heart The independent
evolution of the same or a similar biological trait is referred to as convergent evolution
402  Components of the Blood
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

List the basic components of the blood

Compare red and white blood cells

Describe blood plasma and serum
Hemoglobin is responsible for distributing oxygen and to a lesser extent carbon dioxide throughout the
circulatory systems of humans vertebrates and many invertebrates The blood is more than the proteins
though Blood is actually a term used to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma
the liquid portion which contains water proteins salts lipids and glucose and the cells red and white cells
and cell fragments called platelets Blood plasma is actually the dominant component of blood and contains
the water proteins electrolytes lipids and glucose The cells are responsible for carrying the gases red cells
and the immune response white The platelets are responsible for blood clotting Interstitial fluid that surrounds
cells is separate from the blood but in hemolymph they are combined In humans cellular components make
up approximately 45 percent of the blood and the liquid plasma 55 percent Blood is 20 percent of a persons
extracellular fluid and eight percent of weight
The Role of Blood in the Body
Blood like the human blood illustrated in Figure 405 is important for regulation of the bodys systems and
homeostasis Blood helps maintain homeostasis by stabilizing pH temperature osmotic pressure and by
eliminating excess heat Blood supports growth by distributing nutrients and hormones and by removing waste
Blood plays a protective role by transporting clotting factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting
the diseasefighting agents or white blood cells to sites of infection
