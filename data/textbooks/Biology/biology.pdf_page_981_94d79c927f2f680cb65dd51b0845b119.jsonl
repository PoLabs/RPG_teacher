Introduction
Plants have evolved different reproductive strategies for the continuation of their species Some plants reproduce
sexually and others asexually in contrast to animal species which rely almost exclusively on sexual
reproduction Plant sexual reproduction usually depends on pollinating agents while asexual reproduction is
independent of these agents Flowers are often the showiest or most strongly scented part of plants With their
bright colors fragrances and interesting shapes and sizes flowers attract insects birds and animals to serve
their pollination needs Other plants pollinate via wind or water still others selfpollinate
321  Reproductive Development and Structure
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the two stages of a plants lifecycle

Compare and contrast male and female gametophytes and explain how they form in angiosperms

Describe the reproductive structures of a plant

Describe the components of a complete flower

Describe the development of microsporangium and megasporangium in gymnosperms
Sexual reproduction takes place with slight variations in different groups of plants Plants have two distinct
stages in their lifecycle the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage The haploid gametophyte produces
the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures Fusion of the male and females
gametes forms the diploid zygote which develops into the sporophyte After reaching maturity the diploid
sporophyte produces spores by meiosis which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid gametophyte
The new gametophyte produces gametes and the cycle continues This is the alternation of generations and is
