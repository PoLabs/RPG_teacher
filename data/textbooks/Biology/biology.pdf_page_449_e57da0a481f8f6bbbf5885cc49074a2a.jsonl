Figure 163 The tryptophan operon The five genes that are needed to synthesize tryptophan in E coli are located
next to each other in the trp operon When tryptophan is plentiful two tryptophan molecules bind the repressor protein
at the operator sequence This physically blocks the RNA polymerase from transcribing the tryptophan genes When
tryptophan is absent the repressor protein does not bind to the operator and the genes are transcribed
The trp operon includes three important regions the coding region the trp operator and the trp promoter The
coding region includes the genes for the five tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes Just before the coding region is
the transcriptional start site The promoter sequence to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription
is before or upstream of the transcriptional start site Between the promoter and the transcriptional start site is
the operator region
The trp operator contains the DNA code to which the trp repressor protein can bind However the repressor
alone cannot bind to the operator When tryptophan is present in the cell two tryptophan molecules bind to
the trp repressor which changes the shape of the repressor protein to a form that can bind to the trp operator
Binding of the tryptophanrepressor complex at the operator physically prevents the RNA polymerase from
binding to the promoter and transcribing the downstream genes
When tryptophan is not present in the cell the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator the polymerase
can transcribe the enzyme genes and tryptophan is synthesized Because the repressor protein actively binds
to the operator to keep the genes turned off the trp operon is said to be negatively regulated and the proteins
that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative regulators

Catabolite Activator Protein CAP A Transcriptional Activator
Just as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules there are proteins that bind to the
promoter sequences that act as positive regulators to turn genes on and activate them For example when
glucose is scarce E coli bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel To do this new genes to process
these alternate sugars must be transcribed When glucose levels drop cyclic AMP cAMP begins to accumulate
in the cell The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in
E coli Accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator protein CAP a protein that
