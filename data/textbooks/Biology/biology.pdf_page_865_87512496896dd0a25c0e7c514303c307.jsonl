the embryonic notochord but eventually replace it in adults In most derived vertebrates the notochord becomes
the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs that cushion and support adjacent vertebrae

The relationship of the vertebrates to the invertebrate chordates has been a matter of contention but although
these cladistic relationships are still being examined it appears that the CraniataVertebrata are a monophyletic
group that shares the five basic chordate characteristics with the other two subphyla Urochordata and
Cephalochordata Traditional phylogenies place the cephalochordates as a sister clade to the chordates a
view that has been supported by most current molecular analyses This hypothesis is further supported by the
discovery of a fossil in China from the genus Haikouella This organism seems to be an intermediate form
between cephalochordates and vertebrates The Haikouella fossils are about 530 million years old and appear
similar to modern lancelets These organisms had a brain and eyes as do vertebrates but lack the skull found
in craniates

This evidence suggests that vertebrates arose during the Cambrian explosion
Vertebrates are the largest group of chordates with more than 62000 living species which are grouped based
on anatomical and physiological traits More than one classification and naming scheme is used for these
animals Here we will consider the traditional groups Agnatha Chondrichthyes Osteichthyes Amphibia Reptilia
Aves and Mammalia which constitute classes in the subphylum VertebrataCraniata Virtually all modern
cladists classify birds within Reptilia which correctly reflects their evolutionary heritage Thus we now have
the nonavian reptiles and the avian reptiles in our reptilian classification We consider them separately only
for convenience Further we will consider hagfishes and lampreys together as jawless fishes the Agnatha
although emerging classification schemes separate them into chordate jawless fishes the hagfishes and
vertebrate jawless fishes the lampreys
Animals that possess jaws are known as gnathostomes which means jawed mouth Gnathostomes include
fishes and tetrapods Tetrapod literally means fourfooted which refers to the phylogenetic history of various
land vertebrates even though in some of the tetrapods the limbs may have been modified for purposes other
than walking Tetrapods include amphibians reptiles birds and mammals and technically could also refer to
the extinct fishlike groups that gave rise to the tetrapods Tetrapods can be further divided into two groups
amphibians and amniotes Amniotes are animals whose eggs contain four extraembryonic membranes yolk
sac amnion chorion and allantois that provide nutrition and a waterretaining environment for their embryos
Amniotes are adapted for terrestrial living and include mammals reptiles and birds
292  Fishes
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the difference between jawless and jawed fishes

Discuss the distinguishing features of sharks and rays compared to other modern fishes
Modern fishes include an estimated 31000 species by far the most of all clades within the Vertebrata Fishes
