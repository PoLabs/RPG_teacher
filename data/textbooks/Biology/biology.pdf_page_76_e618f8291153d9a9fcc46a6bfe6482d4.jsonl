22 Water
Water has many properties that are critical to maintaining life It is a polar molecule allowing for forming
hydrogen bonds Hydrogen bonds allow ions and other polar molecules to dissolve in water Therefore water is
an excellent solvent The hydrogen bonds between water molecules cause the water to have a high heat
capacity meaning it takes considerable added heat to raise its temperature As the temperature rises the
hydrogen bonds between water continually break and form anew This allows for the overall temperature to
remain stable although energy is added to the system Water also exhibits a high heat of vaporization which is
key to how organisms cool themselves by evaporating sweat Waters cohesive forces allow for the property of
surface tension whereas we see its adhesive properties as water rises inside capillary tubes The pH value is
a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution and is one of many chemical characteristics that is highly
regulated in living organisms through homeostasis Acids and bases can change pH values but buffers tend to
moderate the changes they cause These properties of water are intimately connected to the biochemical and
physical processes performed by living organisms and life would be very different if these properties were
altered if it could exist at all
23 Carbon
The unique properties of carbon make it a central part of biological molecules Carbon binds to oxygen
hydrogen and nitrogen covalently to form the many molecules important for cellular function Carbon has four
electrons in its outermost shell and can form four bonds Carbon and hydrogen can form hydrocarbon chains or
rings Functional groups are groups of atoms that confer specific properties to hydrocarbon or substituted
hydrocarbon chains or rings that define their overall chemical characteristics and function
