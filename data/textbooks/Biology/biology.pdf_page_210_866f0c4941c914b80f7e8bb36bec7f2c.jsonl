71  Energy in Living Systems
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Discuss the importance of electrons in the transfer of energy in living systems

Explain how ATP is used by cells as an energy source
Energy production within a cell involves many coordinated chemical pathways Most of these pathways are
combinations of oxidation and reduction reactions which occur at the same time An oxidation reaction strips
an electron from an atom in a compound and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction
reaction Because oxidation and reduction usually occur together these pairs of reactions are called oxidation
reduction reactions or redox reactions
Electrons and Energy
The removal of an electron from a molecule oxidizing it results in a decrease in potential energy in the oxidized
compound The electron sometimes as part of a hydrogen atom does not remain unbonded however in the
cytoplasm of a cell Rather the electron is shifted to a second compound reducing the second compound The
shift of an electron from one compound to another removes some potential energy from the first compound the
oxidized compound and increases the potential energy of the second compound the reduced compound The
transfer of electrons between molecules is important because most of the energy stored in atoms and used
to fuel cell functions is in the form of highenergy electrons The transfer of energy in the form of highenergy
electrons allows the cell to transfer and use energy in an incremental fashionin small packages rather than in
a single destructive burst This chapter focuses on the extraction of energy from food you will see that as you
track the path of the transfers you are tracking the path of electrons moving through metabolic pathways
Electron Carriers
In living systems a small class of compounds functions as electron shuttles they bind and carry highenergy
electrons between compounds in biochemical pathways The principal electron carriers we will consider are
derived from the B vitamin group and are derivatives of nucleotides These compounds can be easily reduced
that is they accept electrons or oxidized they lose electrons Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD
Figure 72 is derived from vitamin B3 niacin NAD is the oxidized form of the molecule NADH is the reduced
form of the molecule after it has accepted two electrons and a proton which together are the equivalent of a
hydrogen atom with an extra electron Note that if a compound has an H on it it is generally reduced eg
NADH is the reduced form of NAD
NAD can accept electrons from an organic molecule according to the general equation

When electrons are added to a compound it is reduced A compound that reduces another is called a reducing
agent In the above equation RH is a reducing agent and NAD is reduced to NADH When electrons are
removed from a compound it is oxidized A compound that oxidizes another is called an oxidizing agent In the
above equation NAD is an oxidizing agent and RH is oxidized to R
Similarly flavin adenine dinucleotide FAD is derived from vitamin B2 also called riboflavin Its reduced form
is FADH2 A second variation of NAD NADP contains an extra phosphate group Both NAD and FAD are
extensively used in energy extraction from sugars and NADP plays an important role in anabolic reactions and
photosynthesis in plants
