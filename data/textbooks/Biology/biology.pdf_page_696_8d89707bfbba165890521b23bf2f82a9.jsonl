Figure 2420 Shelf fungi Shelf fungi so called because they grow on trees in a stack attack and digest the trunk or
branches of a tree While some shelf fungi are found only on dead trees others can parasitize living trees and cause
eventual death so they are considered serious tree pathogens credit Cory Zanker
Mutualistic Relationships
Symbiosis is the ecological interaction between two organisms that live together This definition does not
describe the type or quality of the interaction When both members of the association benefit the symbiotic
relationship is called mutualistic Fungi form mutualistic associations with many types of organisms including
cyanobacteria algae plants and animals
FungusPlant Mutualism
One of the most remarkable associations between fungi and plants is the establishment of mycorrhizae
Mycorrhiza which is derived from the Greek words myco meaning fungus and rhizo meaning root refers to
the fungal partner of a mutualistic association between vascular plant roots and their symbiotic fungi Nearly 90
percent of all vascular plant species have mycorrhizal partners In a mycorrhizal association the fungal mycelia
use their extensive network of hyphae and large surface area in contact with the soil to channel water and
minerals from the soil into the plant In exchange the plant supplies the products of photosynthesis to fuel the
metabolism of the fungus
There are several basic types of mycorrhizae Ectomycorrhizae outside mycorrhizae depend on fungi
enveloping the roots in a sheath called a mantle Hyphae grow from the mantle into the root and envelope
the outer layers of the root cells in a network of hyphae called a Hartig net Figure 2421 The fungal partner
can belong to the Ascomycota Basidiomycota or Zygomycota Endomycorrhizae inside mycorrhizae also
called arbuscular mycorrhizae are produced when the fungi grow inside the root in a branched structure called
an arbuscule from the Latin for little trees The fungal partners of endomycorrhizal associates all belong to
the Glomeromycota The fungal arbuscules penetrate root cells between the cell wall and the plasma membrane
and are the site of the metabolic exchanges between the fungus and the host plant Figure 2421b and Figure
2422b Orchids rely on a third type of mycorrhiza Orchids are epiphytes that typically produce very small
airborne seeds without much storage to sustain germination and growth Their seeds will not germinate without a
mycorrhizal partner usually a Basidiomycete After nutrients in the seed are depleted fungal symbionts support
the growth of the orchid by providing necessary carbohydrates and minerals Some orchids continue to be
mycorrhizal throughout their life cycle
