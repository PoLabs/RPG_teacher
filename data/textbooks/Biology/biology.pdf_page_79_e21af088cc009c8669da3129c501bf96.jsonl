Introduction
Food provides the body with the nutrients it needs to survive Many of these critical nutrients are biological
macromolecules or large molecules necessary for life Different smaller organic molecule monomer
combinations build these macromolecules polymers What specific biological macromolecules do living things
require How do these molecules form What functions do they serve We explore these questions in this
