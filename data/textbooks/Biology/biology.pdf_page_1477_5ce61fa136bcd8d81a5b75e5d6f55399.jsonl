This study shows the energy content and transfer between various ecosystem compartments
Figure 468 This conceptual model shows the flow of energy through a spring ecosystem in Silver Springs
Florida Notice that the energy decreases with each increase in trophic level
Why do you think the value for gross productivity of the primary producers is the same as the value for total

Analytical and Simulation Models
The major limitation of conceptual models is their inability to predict the consequences of changes in ecosystem
species andor environment Ecosystems are dynamic entities and subject to a variety of abiotic and biotic
disturbances caused by natural forces andor human activity Ecosystems altered from their initial equilibrium
state can often recover from such disturbances and return to a state of equilibrium As most ecosystems are
subject to periodic disturbances and are often in a state of change they are usually either moving toward or away
from their equilibrium state There are many of these equilibrium states among the various components of an
