volume and residual volume Tidal volume TV measures the amount of air that is inspired and expired during
a normal breath On average this volume is around onehalf liter which is a little less than the capacity of a
20ounce drink bottle The expiratory reserve volume ERV is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled
after a normal exhalation It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal Conversely the
inspiratory reserve volume IRV is the additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation
The residual volume RV is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled The lungs
are never completely empty There is always some air left in the lungs after a maximal exhalation If this residual
volume did not exist and the lungs emptied completely the lung tissues would stick together and the energy
necessary to reinflate the lung could be too great to overcome Therefore there is always some air remaining
in the lungs Residual volume is also important for preventing large fluctuations in respiratory gases O2 and
CO2 The residual volume is the only lung volume that cannot be measured directly because it is impossible to
completely empty the lung of air This volume can only be calculated rather than measured
Capacities are measurements of two or more volumes The vital capacity VC measures the maximum amount
of air that can be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume
tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume The inspiratory capacity IC is the amount of air that can be
inhaled after the end of a normal expiration It is therefore the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve
volume The functional residual capacity FRC includes the expiratory reserve volume and the residual
volume The FRC measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation Lastly
the total lung capacity TLC is a measurement of the total amount of air that the lung can hold It is the sum of
the residual volume expiratory reserve volume tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume
Lung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry An important measurement taken during
spirometry is the forced expiratory volume FEV which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung
over a specific period usually one second FEV1 In addition the forced vital capacity FVC which is the total
amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled is measured The ratio of these values  FEV1FVC ratio is used to
diagnose lung diseases including asthma emphysema and fibrosis If the FEV1FVC ratio is high the lungs are
not compliant meaning they are stiff and unable to bend properly and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis
Patients exhale most of the lung volume very quickly Conversely when the FEV1FVC ratio is low there is
resistance in the lung that is characteristic of asthma In this instance it is hard for the patient to get the air out
of his or her lungs and it takes a long time to reach the maximal exhalation volume In either case breathing is
difficult and complications arise
Respiratory Therapist
Respiratory therapists or respiratory practitioners evaluate and treat patients with lung and cardiovascular
diseases They work as part of a medical team to develop treatment plans for patients Respiratory
therapists may treat premature babies with underdeveloped lungs patients with chronic conditions such
as asthma or older patients suffering from lung disease such as emphysema and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease COPD They may operate advanced equipment such as compressed gas delivery
systems ventilators blood gas analyzers and resuscitators Specialized programs to become a respiratory
therapist generally lead to a bachelors degree with a respiratory therapist specialty Because of a growing
aging population career opportunities as a respiratory therapist are expected to remain strong
Gas Pressure and Respiration
The respiratory process can be better understood by examining the properties of gases Gases move freely but
gas particles are constantly hitting the walls of their vessel thereby producing gas pressure
Air is a mixture of gases primarily nitrogen N2 786 percent oxygen O2 209 percent water vapor H2O
05 percent and carbon dioxide CO2 004 percent Each gas component of that mixture exerts a pressure
The pressure for an individual gas in the mixture is the partial pressure of that gas Approximately 21 percent
of atmospheric gas is oxygen Carbon dioxide however is found in relatively small amounts 004 percent The
partial pressure for oxygen is much greater than that of carbon dioxide The partial pressure of any gas can be
calculated by
P  Patm  percent content in mixture
