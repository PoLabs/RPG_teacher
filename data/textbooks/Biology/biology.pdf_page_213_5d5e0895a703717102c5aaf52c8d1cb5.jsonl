the reaction is used to add the third phosphate to an available ADP molecule producing ATP Figure 74 This
very direct method of phosphorylation is called substratelevel phosphorylation
Figure 74 In phosphorylation reactions the gamma third phosphate of ATP is attached to a protein
Oxidative Phosphorylation
Most of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism however is derived from a much more complex process
chemiosmosis which takes place in mitochondria Figure 75 within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane
of a prokaryotic cell Chemiosmosis a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism is used to generate
90 percent of the ATP made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of
photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight The production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is
called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen in the process
Figure 75 In eukaryotes oxidative phosphorylation takes place in mitochondria In prokaryotes this process takes
place in the plasma membrane Credit modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal
Mitochondrial Disease Physician
What happens when the critical reactions of cellular respiration do not proceed correctly This may happen
in mitochondrial diseases which are genetic disorders of metabolism Mitochondrial disorders can arise
from mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA and they result in the production of less energy than
is normal in body cells In type 2 diabetes for instance the oxidation efficiency of NADH is reduced
impacting oxidative phosphorylation but not the other steps of respiration Symptoms of mitochondrial
diseases can include muscle weakness lack of coordination strokelike episodes and loss of vision and
hearing Most affected people are diagnosed in childhood although there are some adultonset diseases
Identifying and treating mitochondrial disorders is a specialized medical field The educational preparation
for this profession requires a college education followed by medical school with a specialization in medical
genetics Medical geneticists can be board certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and go on
to become associated with professional organizations devoted to the study of mitochondrial diseases such
as the Mitochondrial Medicine Society and the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders
