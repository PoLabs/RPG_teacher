quantum mechanics which scientists call wave functions can predict within a certain level of probability where
an electron might be at any given time Scientists call the area where an electron is most likely to be found its
orbital
Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atoms electron shell configuration Within each electron shell are
subshells and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons While it is impossible to
calculate exactly an electrons location scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path
The letter s p d and f designate the subshells The s subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital
Principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital which can hold two electrons Principal shell 2n has one s and one
p subshell and can hold a total of eight electrons The p subshell has three dumbbellshaped orbitals as Figure
28 illustrates Subshells d and f have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals respectively
We do not show these in the illustration Principal shell 3n has s p and d subshells and can hold 18 electrons
Principal shell 4n has s p d and f orbitals and can hold 32 electrons Moving away from the nucleus the number
of electrons and orbitals in the energy levels increases Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic
table we can determine the electron structure by fitting an extra electron into the next available orbital
Figure 28 The s subshells are shaped like spheres Both the 1n and 2n principal shells have an s orbital but the size
of the sphere is larger in the 2n orbital Each sphere is a single orbital Three dumbbellshaped orbitals comprise p
subshells Principal shell 2n has a p subshell but shell 1 does not
The closest orbital to the nucleus the 1s orbital can hold up to two electrons This orbital is equivalent to the
Bohr models innermost electron shell Scientists call it the 1s orbital because it is spherical around the nucleus
The 1s orbital is the closest orbital to the nucleus and it is always filled first before any other orbital fills
Hydrogen has one electron therefore it occupies only one spot within the 1s orbital We designate this as 1s1
where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1s orbital Helium has two electrons therefore it
can completely fill the 1s orbital with its two electrons We designate this as 1s2 referring to the two electrons of
helium in the 1s orbital On the periodic table Figure 25 hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the
first row period This is because they only have electrons in their first shell the 1s orbital Hydrogen and helium
are the only two elements that have the 1s and no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state
The second electron shell may contain eight electrons This shell contains another spherical s orbital and three
dumbbell shaped p orbitals each of which can hold two electrons as Figure 28 shows After the 1s orbital fills
the second electron shell fills first filling its 2s orbital and then its three p orbitals When filling the p orbitals each
takes a single electron Once each p orbital has an electron it may add a second Lithium Li contains three
electrons that occupy the first and second shells Two electrons fill the 1s orbital and the third electron then fills
the 2s orbital Its electron configuration is 1s22s1 Neon Ne alternatively has a total of ten electrons two are
in its innermost 1s orbital and eight fill its second shell two each in the 2s and three p orbitals Thus it is an
