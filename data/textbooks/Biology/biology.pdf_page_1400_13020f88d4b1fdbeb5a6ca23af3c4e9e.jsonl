Figure 4421 The ocean is divided into different zones based on water depth and distance from the shoreline
In which of the following regions would you expect to find photosynthetic organisms
a
the aphotic zone the neritic zone the oceanic zone and the benthic realm
b
the photic zone the intertidal zone the neritic zone and the oceanic zone
c
the photic zone the abyssal zone the neritic zone and the oceanic zone
d
the pelagic realm the aphotic zone the neritic zone and the oceanic zone
Marine Biomes
The ocean is the largest marine biome It is a continuous body of salt water that is relatively uniform in chemical
composition in fact it is a weak solution of mineral salts and decayed biological matter Within the ocean coral
reefs are a second kind of marine biome Estuaries coastal areas where salt water and fresh water mix form a
third unique marine biome
Ocean
The physical diversity of the ocean is a significant influence on plants animals and other organisms The ocean
is categorized into different zones based on how far light reaches into the water Each zone has a distinct group
of species adapted to the biotic and abiotic conditions particular to that zone
The intertidal zone which is the zone between high and low tide is the oceanic region that is closest to land
Figure 4421 Generally most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach In some cases the
intertidal zone is indeed a sandy beach but it can also be rocky or muddy The intertidal zone is an extremely
variable environment because of action of tidal ebb and flow Organisms are exposed to air and sunlight at
low tide and are underwater most of the time especially during high tide Therefore living things that thrive in
the intertidal zone are adapted to being dry for long periods of time The shore of the intertidal zone may also
be repeatedly struck by waves and the organisms found there are adapted to withstand damage from their
pounding action Figure 4422 The exoskeletons of shoreline crustaceans such as the shore crab Carcinus
maenas are tough and protect them from desiccation drying out and wave damage Another consequence of
the pounding waves is that few algae and plants establish themselves in the constantly moving rocks sand or
mud
