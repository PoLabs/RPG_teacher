expenditure Imbalances can have serious health consequences For example eating too much food while
not expending much energy leads to obesity which in turn will increase the risk of developing illnesses
such as type2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease The recent rise in obesity and related diseases makes
understanding the role of diet and nutrition in maintaining good health all the more important
341  Digestive Systems
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain the processes of digestion and absorption

Compare and contrast different types of digestive systems

Explain the specialized functions of the organs involved in processing food in the body

Describe the ways in which organs work together to digest food and absorb nutrients
Animals obtain their nutrition from the consumption of other organisms Depending on their diet animals can be
classified into the following categories plant eaters herbivores meat eaters carnivores and those that eat
both plants and animals omnivores The nutrients and macromolecules present in food are not immediately
accessible to the cells There are a number of processes that modify food within the animal body in order to
make the nutrients and organic molecules accessible for cellular function As animals evolved in complexity of
form and function their digestive systems have also evolved to accommodate their various dietary needs
Herbivores Omnivores and Carnivores
Herbivores are animals whose primary food source is plantbased Examples of herbivores as shown in Figure
342 include vertebrates like deer koalas and some bird species as well as invertebrates such as crickets and
caterpillars These animals have evolved digestive systems capable of handling large amounts of plant material
Herbivores can be further classified into frugivores fruiteaters granivores seed eaters nectivores nectar
feeders and folivores leaf eaters

Carnivores are animals that eat other animals The word carnivore is derived from Latin and literally means
meat eater Wild cats such as lions shown in Figure 343a and tigers are examples of vertebrate carnivores
as are snakes and sharks while invertebrate carnivores include sea stars spiders and ladybugs shown in
