18  EVOLUTION AND THE
ORIGIN OF SPECIES
Figure 181 All organisms are products of evolution adapted to their environment a Saguaro Carnegiea gigantea
can soak up 750 liters of water in a single rain storm enabling these cacti to survive the dry conditions of the Sonora
desert in Mexico and the Southwestern United States b The Andean semiaquatic lizard Potamites montanicola
discovered in Peru in 2010 lives between 1570 to 2100 meters in elevation and unlike most lizards is nocturnal
and swims Scientists still do not know how these coldblood animals are able to move in the cold 10 to 15C

Introduction
All living organisms from bacteria to baboons to blueberries evolved at some point from a different species
Although it may seem that living things today stay much the same that is not the caseevolution is an ongoing
process
The theory of evolution is the unifying theory of biology meaning it is the framework within which biologists ask
questions about the living world Its power is that it provides direction for predictions about living things that are
borne out in ongoing experiments The Ukrainianborn American geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky famously
wrote that nothing makes sense in biology except in the light of evolution
1
He meant that the tenet that all life
has evolved and diversified from a common ancestor is the foundation from which we approach all questions in
biology
