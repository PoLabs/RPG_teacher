desmids as well as the genera Spirogyra Coleochaete and Chara There are familiar green algae in both
groups Some green algae are single cells such as Chlamydomonas and desmids which adds to the ambiguity
of green algae classification because plants are multicellular Other green algae like Volvox form colonies and
some like Ulva are multicellular Figure 257 Spirogyra is a long filament of colonial cells Most members of
this genus live in fresh water brackish water seawater or even in snow patches A few green algae can survive
on soil provided it is covered by a thin film of moisture within which they can live Periodic dry spells provide a
selective advantage to algae that can survive water stress
Figure 257 Green algae Charophyta include a Spirogyra and b desmids Chlorophyta include c Chlamydomonas
and d Ulva Desmids and Chlamydomonas are singlecelled organisms Spirogyra forms chains of cells and Ulva
forms multicellular structures resembling leaves although the cells are not differentiated as they are in higher plants

The chlorophytes and the charophytes differ in a few respects that in addition to molecular analysis place the
land plants as a sister group of the charophytes First cells in charophytes and the land plants divide along cell
plates called phragmoplasts in which microtubules parallel to the spindle serve as guides for the vesicles of
the forming cell plate In the chlorophytes the cell plate is organized by a phycoplast in which the microtubules
are perpendicular to the spindle Second only the charophytes and the land plants have plasmodesmata
or intercellular channels that allow the transfer of materials from cell to cell In the chlorophytes intercellular
connections do not persist in mature multicellular forms Finally both charophytes and the land plants show
apical growthgrowth from the tips of the plant rather than throughout the plant body Consequently land plants
and the charophytes are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta
Reproduction of Green Algae
Green algae reproduce both asexually by fragmentation or dispersal of spores or sexually by producing
gametes that fuse during fertilization In a singlecelled organism such as Chlamydomonas there is no mitosis
after fertilization In the multicellular Ulva a sporophyte grows by mitosis after fertilization and thus exhibits
