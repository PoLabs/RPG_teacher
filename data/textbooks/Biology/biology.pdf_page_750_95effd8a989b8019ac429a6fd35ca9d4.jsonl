Figure 268 Conifer life cycle This image shows the life cycle of a conifer Pollen from male cones blows up into
upper branches where it fertilizes female cones The megaspore shown in the image develops into the female
gametophyte as the pollen tube slowly grows toward it eventually fusing with the egg and delivering a male
nucleus which combines with the female nucleus of the mature egg
At what stage does the diploid zygote form
a
when the female cone begins to bud from the tree
b
at fertilization
c
when the seeds drop from the tree
d
when the pollen tube begins to grow

Diversity of Gymnosperms
Modern gymnosperms are classified into four phyla Coniferophyta Cycadophyta and Ginkgophyta are similar
