but the leaf also cannot acquire new carbon dioxide molecules from the environment This limits the lightindependent
reactions to only continuing until the carbon dioxide stores in the leaf are depleted
27 Both of these molecules carry
energy in the case of NADPH it has reducing power that is used to fuel the process of making carbohydrate molecules
in lightindependent reactions 29 Because RuBP the molecule needed at the start of the cycle is regenerated from
G3P 31 Because G3P has three carbon atoms and each turn of the cycle takes in one carbon atom in the form of
carbon dioxide 33 In the defined ecosystem energy would radiate from the Sun and be absorbed by the chlorophyll
in the leaves of the tree Photosynthesis would occur in the leaves transforming the light energy into stored chemical
energy in the covalent bonds of carbon molecules The giraffe would eat the leaves of the tree and digest the carbon
molecules to release energy In the same ecosystem nutrients would cycle between the tree and the giraffe The
giraffe would consume oxygen and release carbon dioxide as its cells perform aerobic respiration to create chemical
energy The tree will consume the released carbon dioxide during photosynthesis to create its own stored chemical
energy and release oxygen as a byproduct

B 15 B 17 C 19 D 21 D 23 Intracellular signaling occurs within a cell and intercellular signaling occurs between
cells 25 Internal receptors are located inside the cell and their ligands enter the cell to bind the receptor The complex
formed by the internal receptor and the ligand then enters the nucleus and directly affects protein production by binding
to the chromosomal DNA and initiating the making of mRNA that codes for proteins Cellsurface receptors however
are embedded in the plasma membrane and their ligands do not enter the cell Binding of the ligand to the cellsurface
receptor initiates a cell signaling cascade and does not directly influence the making of proteins however it may
involve the activation of intracellular proteins 27 Insulins receptor is an enzymelinked transmembrane receptor as
can be determined from the tyrosine kinase in its name This receptor is embedded in the plasma membrane and
insulin binds to its extracellular outer surface to initiate intracellular signaling cascades Normally steroid hormones
cross the plasma membrane to bind with intracellular receptors These intracellular hormonereceptor complexes then
interact directly with DNA to regulate transcription This limits steroid hormones to be small nonpolar molecules so
they can cross the plasma membrane However since insulin does not have to cross into the cell it could be large
or polar it is a small polar molecule 29 The binding of the ligand to the extracellular domain would activate the
pathway normally activated by the receptor donating the intracellular domain 31 If a kinase is mutated so that it is
always activated it will continuously signal through the pathway and lead to uncontrolled growth and possibly cancer
If a kinase is mutated so that it cannot function the cell will not respond to ligand binding 33 Possible explanations
EGFR dimer cannot separateAn upstream mutation in Ras Raf MEK constitutively activates the signaling
cascadeERK has a mutation that prevents it from binding to its phosphataseThe cell has a mutation preventing the
expression or function of the ERKspecific phosphatase 35 Multicellular organisms must coordinate many different
events in different cell types that may be very distant from each other Singlecelled organisms are only concerned with
their immediate environment and the presence of other cells in the area

D 26 C 28 Human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes 22 pairs and 2 sex chromosomes that may or may not form a
pair This is the 2n or diploid condition Human gametes have 23 chromosomes one each of 23 unique chromosomes
one of which is a sex chromosome This is the n or haploid condition 30 The DNA double helix is wrapped around
histone proteins to form structures called nucleosomes Nucleosomes and the linker DNA in between them are coiled
into a 30nm fiber During cell division chromatin is further condensed by packing proteins 32 The mitotic spindle
is formed of microtubules Microtubules are polymers of the protein tubulin therefore it is the mitotic spindle that is
disrupted by these drugs Without a functional mitotic spindle the chromosomes will not be sorted or separated during
mitosis The cell will arrest in mitosis and die 34 Many cells temporarily enter G0 until they reach maturity Some
cells are only triggered to enter G1 when the organism needs to increase that particular cell type Some cells only
reproduce following an injury to the tissue Some cells never divide once they reach maturity 36 The G1 checkpoint
monitors adequate cell growth the state of the genomic DNA adequate stores of energy and materials for S phase
At the G2 checkpoint DNA is checked to ensure that all chromosomes were duplicated and that there are no mistakes
in newly synthesized DNA Additionally cell size and energy reserves are evaluated The M checkpoint confirms the
correct attachment of the mitotic spindle fibers to the kinetochores 38 Cdk must bind to a cyclin and it must be
phosphorylated in the correct position to become fully active 40 If one of the genes that produces regulator proteins
becomes mutated it produces a malformed possibly nonfunctional cellcycle regulator increasing the chance that
more mutations will be left unrepaired in the cell Each subsequent generation of cells sustains more damage The cell
cycle can speed up as a result of the loss of functional checkpoint proteins The cells can lose the ability to selfdestruct
and eventually become immortalized 42 Regulatory mechanisms that might be lost include monitoring of the quality
