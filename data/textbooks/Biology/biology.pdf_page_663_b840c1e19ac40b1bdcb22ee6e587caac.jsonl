that lacks hairlike projections Figure 2326 Members of this subgroup range in size from singlecelled diatoms
to the massive and multicellular kelp

The diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic protists that encase themselves in intricately patterned glassy cell
walls composed of silicon dioxide in a matrix of organic particles Figure 2327 These protists are a component
of freshwater and marine plankton Most species of diatoms reproduce asexually although some instances of
sexual reproduction and sporulation also exist Some diatoms exhibit a slit in their silica shell called a raphe By
expelling a stream of mucopolysaccharides from the raphe the diatom can attach to surfaces or propel itself in
one direction

During periods of nutrient availability diatom populations bloom to numbers greater than can be consumed by
aquatic organisms The excess diatoms die and sink to the sea floor where they are not easily reached by
saprobes that feed on dead organisms As a result the carbon dioxide that the diatoms had consumed and
incorporated into their cells during photosynthesis is not returned to the atmosphere Along with rhizarians and
other shelled protists diatoms help to maintain a balanced carbon cycle
Like diatoms golden algae are largely unicellular although some species can form large colonies Their
characteristic gold color results from their extensive use of carotenoids a group of photosynthetic pigments that
