need the maximum amount of ATP that it can make all the time At times the cell needs to shunt some of the
intermediates to pathways for amino acid protein glycogen lipid and nucleic acid production In short the cell
needs to control its metabolism
Regulatory Mechanisms
A variety of mechanisms is used to control cellular respiration Some type of control exists at each stage of
glucose metabolism Access of glucose to the cell can be regulated using the GLUT glucose transporter
proteins that transport glucose Figure 718 Different forms of the GLUT protein control passage of glucose
into the cells of specific tissues
Figure 718 GLUT4 is a glucose transporter that is stored in vesicles A cascade of events that occurs upon insulin
binding to a receptor in the plasma membrane causes GLUT4containing vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane
so that glucose may be transported into the cell
Some reactions are controlled by having two different enzymesone each for the two directions of a reversible
reaction Reactions that are catalyzed by only one enzyme can go to equilibrium stalling the reaction In
contrast if two different enzymes each specific for a given direction are necessary for a reversible reaction the
opportunity to control the rate of the reaction increases and equilibrium is not reached
A number of enzymes involved in each of the pathwaysin particular the enzyme catalyzing the first committed
reaction of the pathwayare controlled by attachment of a molecule to an allosteric site on the protein
The molecules most commonly used in this capacity are the nucleotides ATP ADP AMP NAD and NADH
These regulatorsallosteric effectorsmay increase or decrease enzyme activity depending on the prevailing
conditions The allosteric effector alters the steric structure of the enzyme usually affecting the configuration of
the active site This alteration of the proteins the enzymes structure either increases or decreases its affinity
for its substrate with the effect of increasing or decreasing the rate of the reaction The attachment signals to
the enzyme This binding can increase or decrease the enzymes activity providing a feedback mechanism This
feedback type of control is effective as long as the chemical affecting it is attached to the enzyme Once the
overall concentration of the chemical decreases it will diffuse away from the protein and the control is relaxed
Control of Catabolic Pathways
Enzymes proteins electron carriers and pumps that play roles in glycolysis the citric acid cycle and the
electron transport chain tend to catalyze nonreversible reactions In other words if the initial reaction takes place
the pathway is committed to proceeding with the remaining reactions Whether a particular enzyme activity is
released depends upon the energy needs of the cell as reflected by the levels of ATP ADP and AMP
Glycolysis
The control of glycolysis begins with the first enzyme in the pathway hexokinase Figure 719 This enzyme
catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose which helps to prepare the compound for cleavage in a later step The
