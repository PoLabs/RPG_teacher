had spread through the continents This compelling fact is used as evidence that nonvascular plants must have
preceded the Silurian period
More than 25000 species of bryophytes thrive in mostly damp habitats although some live in deserts They
constitute the major flora of inhospitable environments like the tundra where their small size and tolerance
to desiccation offer distinct advantages They generally lack lignin and do not have actual tracheids xylem
cells specialized for water conduction Rather water and nutrients circulate inside specialized conducting cells
Although the term nontracheophyte is more accurate bryophytes are commonly called nonvascular plants
In a bryophyte all the conspicuous vegetative organsincluding the photosynthetic leaflike structures the
thallus plant body stem and the rhizoid that anchors the plant to its substratebelong to the haploid
organism or gametophyte The male gametes formed by bryophytes swim with a flagellum so fertilization
is dependent on the presence of water The bryophyte embryo also remains attached to the parent plant
which protects and nourishes it The sporophyte that develops from the embryo is barely noticeable The
sporangiumthe multicellular sexual reproductive structure in which meiosis produces haploid sporesis
present in bryophytes and absent in the majority of algae This is also a characteristic of land plants
The bryophytes are divided into three phyla the liverworts or Hepaticophyta the hornworts or Anthocerotophyta
and the mosses or true Bryophyta
Liverworts
Liverworts Hepaticophyta are currently classified as the plants most closely related to the ancestor of vascular
plants that adapted to terrestrial environments In fact liverworts have colonized every terrestrial habitat on Earth
and diversified to more than 7000 existing species Figure 259 Lobate liverworts form a flat thallus with lobes
that have a vague resemblance to the lobes of the liver Figure 2510 which accounts for the name given to
the phylum Leafy liverworts have tiny leaflike structures attached to a stalk Several leafy liverworts are shown
in Figure 259
