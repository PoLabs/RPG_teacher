Figure 3524 The limbic system regulates emotion and other behaviors It includes parts of the cerebral cortex located
near the center of the brain including the cingulate gyrus and the hippocampus as well as the thalamus hypothalamus
and amygdala
Hypothalamus
Below the thalamus is the hypothalamus shown in Figure 3524 The hypothalamus controls the endocrine
system by sending signals to the pituitary gland a peasized endocrine gland that releases several different
hormones that affect other glands as well as other cells This relationship means that the hypothalamus
regulates important behaviors that are controlled by these hormones The hypothalamus is the bodys
thermostatit makes sure key functions like food and water intake energy expenditure and body temperature
are kept at appropriate levels Neurons within the hypothalamus also regulate circadian rhythms sometimes
called sleep cycles
Limbic System
The limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion as well as behaviors related to fear
and motivation It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as
well as the hippocampus One important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called
the amygdala Greek for almond illustrated in Figure 3524 The two amygdala are important both for the
sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces The cingulate gyrus helps regulate emotions and pain
Cerebellum
The cerebellum Latin for little brain shown in Figure 3521 sits at the base of the brain on top of the
brainstem The cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks
Brainstem
The brainstem illustrated in Figure 3521 connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord It consists of the
midbrain medulla oblongata and the pons Motor and sensory neurons extend through the brainstem allowing
for the relay of signals between the brain and spinal cord Ascending neural pathways cross in this section of
the brain allowing the left hemisphere of the cerebrum to control the right side of the body and vice versa The
brainstem coordinates motor control signals sent from the brain to the body The brainstem controls several
important functions of the body including alertness arousal breathing blood pressure digestion heart rate
swallowing walking and sensory and motor information integration
Spinal Cord
Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord shown
in Figure 3521 The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the
