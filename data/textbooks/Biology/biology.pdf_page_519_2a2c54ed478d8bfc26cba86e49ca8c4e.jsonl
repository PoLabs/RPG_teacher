183  Reconnection and Speciation Rates
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe pathways of species evolution in hybrid zones

Explain the two major theories on rates of speciation
Speciation occurs over a span of evolutionary time so when a new species arises there is a transition period
during which the closely related species continue to interact
Reconnection
After speciation two species may recombine or even continue interacting indefinitely Individual organisms will
mate with any nearby individual with whom they are capable of breeding We call an area where two closely
related species continue to interact and reproduce forming hybrids a hybrid zone Over time the hybrid zone
may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers Figure 1822 If the hybrids
are less fit than the parents speciation reinforcement occurs and the species continue to diverge until they can
no longer mate and produce viable offspring If reproductive barriers weaken fusion occurs and the two species
become one Barriers remain the same if hybrids are fit and reproductive stability may occur and hybridization
continues
Figure 1822 After speciation has occurred the two separate but closely related species may continue to
produce offspring in an area called the hybrid zone Reinforcement fusion or stability may result depending on
reproductive barriers and the relative fitness of the hybrids
If two species eat a different diet but one of the food sources is eliminated and both species are forced to
eat the same foods what change in the hybrid zone is most likely to occur
Hybrids can be either less fit than the parents more fit or about the same Usually hybrids tend to be less fit
therefore such reproduction diminishes over time nudging the two species to diverge further in a process we
call reinforcement Scientists use this term because the hybrids low success reinforces the original speciation
If the hybrids are as fit or more fit than the parents the two species may fuse back into one species Figure
1823 Scientists have also observed that sometimes two species will remain separate but also continue to
interact to produce some individuals Scientists classify this as stability because no real net change is taking
place
