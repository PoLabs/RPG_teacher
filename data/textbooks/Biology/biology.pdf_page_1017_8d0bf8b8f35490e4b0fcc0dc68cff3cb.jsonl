Most animals have an exoskeleton including insects spiders scorpions horseshoe crabs centipedes and
crustaceans Scientists estimate that of insects alone there are over 30 million species on our planet The
exoskeleton is a hard covering or shell that provides benefits to the animal such as protection against damage
from predators and from water loss for land animals it also provides for the attachments of muscles
As the tough and resistant outer cover of an arthropod the exoskeleton may be constructed of a tough polymer
such as chitin and is often biomineralized with materials such as calcium carbonate This is fused to the animals
epidermis Ingrowths of the exoskeleton called apodemes function as attachment sites for muscles similar
to tendons in more advanced animals Figure 333 In order to grow the animal must first synthesize a new
exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed or molt the original covering This limits the animals ability
to grow continually and may limit the individuals ability to mature if molting does not occur at the proper time
The thickness of the exoskeleton must be increased significantly to accommodate any increase in weight It is
estimated that a doubling of body size increases body weight by a factor of eight The increasing thickness of
the chitin necessary to support this weight limits most animals with an exoskeleton to a relatively small size
The same principles apply to endoskeletons but they are more efficient because muscles are attached on the
outside making it easier to compensate for increased mass
Figure 333 Apodemes are ingrowths on arthropod exoskeletons to which muscles attach The apodemes on this crab
leg are located above and below the fulcrum of the claw Contraction of muscles attached to the apodemes pulls the
claw closed
An animal with an endoskeleton has its size determined by the amount of skeletal system it needs in order to
support the other tissues and the amount of muscle it needs for movement As the body size increases both
bone and muscle mass increase The speed achievable by the animal is a balance between its overall size and
the bone and muscle that provide support and movement
Limiting Effects of Diffusion on Size and Development
The exchange of nutrients and wastes between a cell and its watery environment occurs through the process
