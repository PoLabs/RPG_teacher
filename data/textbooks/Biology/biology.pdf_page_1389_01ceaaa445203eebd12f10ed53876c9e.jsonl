occurs the energy found in that living organism is sequestered for some time unless ocean upwelling occurs
Ocean upwelling is the rising of deep ocean waters that occurs when prevailing winds blow along surface
waters near a coastline Figure 449 As the wind pushes ocean waters offshore water from the bottom of
the ocean moves up to replace this water As a result the nutrients once contained in dead organisms become
available for reuse by other living organisms
Figure 449 Ocean upwelling is an important process that recycles nutrients and energy in the ocean As wind green
arrows pushes offshore it causes water from the ocean bottom red arrows to move to the surface bringing up
nutrients from the ocean depths
In freshwater systems such as lakes the recycling of nutrients occurs in response to air temperature and wind
changes The nutrients at the bottom of lakes are recycled twice each year in the spring and fall turnover
The springandfall turnover are seasonal processes that recycle nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of
a freshwater lake to the top of the lake Figure 4410 These turnovers are caused by the formation of a
thermocline layers of water with temperatures that are significantly different from those above and below it
In wintertime the surface of lakes found in many northern regions is frozen However the water under the ice is
slightly warmer and the water at the bottom of the lake is warmer yet at 4 C to 5 C 392 F to 41 F Water
is densest at about 4 C therefore the deepest water is also the densest The deepest water is oxygenpoor
because the decomposition of organic material at the bottom of the lake uses up available oxygen that cannot
be replaced by means of oxygen diffusion into the surface of the water due to the surface ice layer
