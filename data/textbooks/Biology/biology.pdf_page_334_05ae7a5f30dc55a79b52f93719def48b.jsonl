12 How do telophase I and telophase II differ during
meiosis in animal cells
a
Cells remain diploid at the end of telophase
I but are haploid at the end of telophase II

Daughter cells form a cell plate to divide
during telophase I but divide by cytokinesis
during telophase II
c
Cells enter interphase after telophase I but
not after telophase II
d
Chromosomes can remain condensed at the
end of telophase I but decondense after
telophase II

predicted to be better able to cope with the changing
environment
a
jellyfish

18 Many farmers are worried about the decreasing
genetic diversity of plants associated with
generations of artificial selection and inbreeding Why
is limiting random sexual reproduction of food crops
concerning
a
Mutations during asexual reproduction
decrease plant fitness
b
Consumers do not trust identicalappearing
produce
c
Larger portions of the plant populations are
susceptible to the same diseases
d
Spores are not viable in an agricultural
setting
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
19 Describe the process that results in the formation
of a tetrad
20 Explain how the random alignment of
homologous chromosomes during metaphase I
contributes to the variation in gametes produced by
meiosis
21 What is the function of the fused kinetochore
found on sister chromatids in prometaphase I
22 In a comparison of the stages of meiosis to the
stages of mitosis which stages are unique to meiosis
and which stages have the same events in both
meiosis and mitosis
23 Why would an individual with a mutation that
prevented the formation of recombination nodules be
considered less fit than other members of its
species
24 Does crossing over occur during prophase II
From an evolutionary perspective why is this
advantageous
25 List and briefly describe the three processes that
lead to variation in offspring with the same parents
26 Animals and plants both have diploid and haploid
