were very far apart on the same or on different chromosomes
In 1931 Barbara McClintock and Harriet Creighton demonstrated the crossover of homologous chromosomes
in corn plants Weeks later Curt Stern demonstrated microscopically homologous recombination in Drosophila
Stern observed several Xlinked phenotypes that were associated with a structurally unusual and dissimilar
X chromosome pair in which one X was missing a small terminal segment and the other X was fused to a
piece of the Y chromosome By crossing flies observing their offspring and then visualizing the offsprings
chromosomes Stern demonstrated that every time the offspring allele combination deviated from either of the
parental combinations there was a corresponding exchange of an X chromosome segment Using mutant flies
with structurally distinct X chromosomes was the key to observing the products of recombination because DNA
sequencing and other molecular tools were not yet available We now know that homologous chromosomes
regularly exchange segments in meiosis by reciprocally breaking and rejoining their DNA at precise locations

Mendels Mapped Traits
Homologous recombination is a common genetic process yet Mendel never observed it Had he investigated
both linked and unlinked genes it would have been much more difficult for him to create a unified model of his
data on the basis of probabilistic calculations Researchers who have since mapped the seven traits that Mendel
investigated onto a pea plant genomes seven chromosomes have confirmed that all the genes he examined are
either on separate chromosomes or are sufficiently far apart as to be statistically unlinked Some have suggested
that Mendel was enormously lucky to select only unlinked genes whereas others question whether Mendel
discarded any data suggesting linkage In any case Mendel consistently observed independent assortment
because he examined genes that were effectively unlinked
132  Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how a karyogram is created

Explain how nondisjunction leads to disorders in chromosome number

Compare disorders that aneuploidy causes

Describe how errors in chromosome structure occur through inversions and translocations
Inherited disorders can arise when chromosomes behave abnormally during meiosis We can divide
chromosome disorders into two categories abnormalities in chromosome number and chromosomal structural
rearrangements Because even small chromosome segments can span many genes chromosomal disorders
are characteristically dramatic and often fatal
Chromosome Identification
Chromosome isolation and microscopic observation forms the basis of cytogenetics and is the primary method
by which clinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans A karyotype is the number and appearance
of chromosomes and includes their length banding pattern and centromere position To obtain a view of an
individuals karyotype cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into
a chart or karyogram Another name is an ideogram Figure 135
