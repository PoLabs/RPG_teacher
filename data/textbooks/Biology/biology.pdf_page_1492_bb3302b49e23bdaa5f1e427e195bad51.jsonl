The Sulfur Cycle
Sulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living things As a part of the amino acid cysteine it is
involved in the formation of disulfide bonds within proteins which help to determine their 3D folding patterns
and hence their functions As shown in Figure 4621 sulfur cycles between the oceans land and atmosphere
Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide SO2 and enters the atmosphere in three ways from
the decomposition of organic molecules from volcanic activity and geothermal vents and from the burning of
fossil fuels by humans
Figure 4621 Sulfur dioxide from the atmosphere becomes available to terrestrial and marine ecosystems when it is
dissolved in precipitation as weak sulfuric acid or when it falls directly to the Earth as fallout Weathering of rocks also
makes sulfates available to terrestrial ecosystems Decomposition of living organisms returns sulfates to the ocean

On land sulfur is deposited in four major ways precipitation direct fallout from the atmosphere rock weathering
and geothermal vents Figure 4621 Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide SO2 and as rain
falls through the atmosphere sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid H2SO4 Sulfur can also fall
directly from the atmosphere in a process called fallout Also the weathering of sulfurcontaining rocks releases
sulfur into the soil These rocks originate from ocean sediments that are moved to land by the geologic uplifting
of ocean sediments Terrestrial ecosystems can then make use of these soil sulfates  SO4 and upon the
death and decomposition of these organisms release the sulfur back into the atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide
