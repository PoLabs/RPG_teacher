Landscape Designer
Looking at the ornamental arrangement of flower beds and fountains typical of the grounds of royal castles
and historic houses of Europe its clear that the gardens creators knew about more than art and design
They were also familiar with the biology of the plants they chose Landscape design also has strong roots
in the United States tradition A prime example of early American classical design is Monticello Thomas
Jeffersons private estate Among his many interests Jefferson maintained a strong passion for botany
Landscape layout can encompass a small private space like a backyard garden public gathering places
such as Central Park in New York City or an entire city plan like Pierre LEnfants design for Washington
DC
A landscape designer will plan traditional public spacessuch as botanical gardens parks college
campuses gardens and larger developmentsas well as natural areas and private gardens The
restoration of natural places encroached on by human intervention such as wetlands also requires the
expertise of a landscape designer
With such an array of necessary skills a landscape designers education should include a solid background
in botany soil science plant pathology entomology and horticulture Coursework in architecture and design
software is also required for the completion of the degree The successful design of a landscape rests on an
extensive knowledge of plant growth requirements such as light and shade moisture levels compatibility of
different species and susceptibility to pathogens and pests Mosses and ferns will thrive in a shaded area
where fountains provide moisture cacti on the other hand would not fare well in that environment The
future growth of individual plants must be taken into account to avoid crowding and competition for light
and nutrients The appearance of the space over time is also of concern Shapes colors and biology must
be balanced for a wellmaintained and sustainable green space Art architecture and biology blend in a
beautifully designed and implemented landscape Figure 2525
