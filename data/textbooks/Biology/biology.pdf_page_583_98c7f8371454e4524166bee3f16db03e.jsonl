immune system and persist in individuals for years all the while producing low levels of progeny virions in what
is known as a chronic viral disease Chronic infection of the liver by this virus leads to a much greater chance of
developing liver cancer sometimes as much as 30 years after the initial infection
As already discussed herpes simplex virus can remain in a state of latency in nervous tissue for months even
years As the virus hides in the tissue and makes few if any viral proteins there is nothing for the immune
response to act against and immunity to the virus slowly declines Under certain conditions including various
types of physical and psychological stress the latent herpes simplex virus may be reactivated and undergo a
lytic replication cycle in the skin causing the lesions associated with the disease Once virions are produced
in the skin and viral proteins are synthesized the immune response is again stimulated and resolves the skin
lesions in a few days or weeks by destroying viruses in the skin As a result of this type of replicative cycle
appearances of cold sores and genital herpes outbreaks only occur intermittently even though the viruses
remain in the nervous tissue for life Latent infections are common with other herpesviruses as well including
the varicellazoster virus that causes chickenpox After having a chickenpox infection in childhood the varicella
zoster virus can remain latent for many years and reactivate in adults to cause the painful condition known as
shingles Figure 2111

Some animalinfecting viruses including the hepatitis C virus discussed above are known as oncogenic
viruses They have the ability to cause cancer These viruses interfere with the normal regulation of the host
cell cycle either by introducing genes that stimulate unregulated cell growth oncogenes or by interfering with
the expression of genes that inhibit cell growth Oncogenic viruses can be either DNA or RNA viruses Cancers
known to be associated with viral infections include cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus HPV
