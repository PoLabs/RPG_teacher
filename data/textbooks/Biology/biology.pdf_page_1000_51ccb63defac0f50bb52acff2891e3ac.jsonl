epicotyl pushes through the tough and abrasive soil the plumule is protected from damage Upon exposure to
light the hypocotyl hook straightens out the young foliage leaves face the sun and expand and the epicotyl
continues to elongate During this time the radicle is also growing and producing the primary root As it grows
downward to form the tap root lateral roots branch off to all sides producing the typical dicot tap root system
In monocot seeds Figure 3221 the testa and tegmen of the seed coat are fused As the seed germinates
the primary root emerges protected by the roottip covering the coleorhiza Next the primary shoot emerges
protected by the coleoptile the covering of the shoot tip Upon exposure to light ie when the plumule has
exited the soil and the protective coleoptile is no longer needed elongation of the coleoptile ceases and the
leaves expand and unfold At the other end of the embryonic axis the primary root soon dies while other
adventitious roots roots that do not arise from the usual place  ie the root emerge from the base of the stem
This gives the monocot a fibrous root system
Figure 3221 As this monocot grass seed germinates the primary root or radicle emerges first followed by the
primary shoot or coleoptile and the adventitious roots
Seed Germination
Many mature seeds enter a period of inactivity or extremely low metabolic activity a process known as
dormancy which may last for months years or even centuries Dormancy helps keep seeds viable during
unfavorable conditions Upon a return to favorable conditions seed germination takes place Favorable
conditions could be as diverse as moisture light cold fire or chemical treatments After heavy rains many new
seedlings emerge Forest fires also lead to the emergence of new seedlings Some seeds require vernalization
cold treatment before they can germinate This guarantees that seeds produced by plants in temperate
climates will not germinate until the spring Plants growing in hot climates may have seeds that need a heat
treatment in order to germinate to avoid germination in the hot dry summers In many seeds the presence of a
thick seed coat retards the ability to germinate Scarification which includes mechanical or chemical processes
to soften the seed coat is often employed before germination Presoaking in hot water or passing through an
acid environment such as an animals digestive tract may also be employed
Depending on seed size the time taken for a seedling to emerge may vary Species with large seeds have
enough food reserves to germinate deep below ground and still extend their epicotyl all the way to the soil
surface Seeds of smallseeded species usually require light as a germination cue This ensures the seeds only
germinate at or near the soil surface where the light is greatest If they were to germinate too far underneath
the surface the developing seedling would not have enough food reserves to reach the sunlight
Development of Fruit and Fruit Types
After fertilization the ovary of the flower usually develops into the fruit Fruits are usually associated with having
a sweet taste however not all fruits are sweet Botanically the term fruit is used for a ripened ovary In most
cases flowers in which fertilization has taken place will develop into fruits and flowers in which fertilization has
not taken place will not Some fruits develop from the ovary and are known as true fruits whereas others develop
from other parts of the female gametophyte and are known as accessory fruits The fruit encloses the seeds and
the developing embryo thereby providing it with protection Fruits are of many types depending on their origin
