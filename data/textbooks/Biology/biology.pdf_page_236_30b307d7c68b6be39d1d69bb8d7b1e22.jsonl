CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
18 Why is it beneficial for cells to use ATP rather
than energy directly from the bonds of
carbohydrates What are the greatest drawbacks to
harnessing energy directly from the bonds of several
different compounds
19 Nearly all organisms on Earth carry out some
form of glycolysis How does this fact support or not
support the assertion that glycolysis is one of the
oldest metabolic pathways
20 Because they lose their mitochondria during
development red blood cells cannot perform aerobic
respiration however they do perform glycolysis in
the cytoplasm Why do all cells need an energy
source and what would happen if glycolysis were
blocked in a red blood cell
21 What is the primary difference between a circular
pathway and a linear pathway
22 How do the roles of ubiquinone and cytochrome c
differ from the roles of the other components of the
electron transport chain
23 What accounts for the different number of ATP
molecules that are formed through cellular
respiration
24 What is the primary difference between
fermentation and anaerobic respiration
25 Would you describe metabolic pathways as
inherently wasteful or inherently economical Why
26 How does citrate from the citric acid cycle affect
glycolysis
27 Why might negative feedback mechanisms be
more common than positive feedback mechanisms in
living cells
