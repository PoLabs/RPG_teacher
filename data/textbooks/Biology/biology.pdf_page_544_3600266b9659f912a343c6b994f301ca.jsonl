CHAPTER SUMMARY
191 Population Evolution
The modern synthesis of evolutionary theory grew out of the cohesion of Darwins Wallaces and Mendels
thoughts on evolution and heredity along with the more modern study of population genetics It describes the
evolution of populations and species from smallscale changes among individuals to largescale changes over
paleontological time periods To understand how organisms evolve scientists can track populations allele
frequencies over time If they differ from generation to generation scientists can conclude that the population is
not in HardyWeinberg equilibrium and is thus evolving
192 Population Genetics
Both genetic and environmental factors can cause phenotypic variation in a population Different alleles can
confer different phenotypes and different environments can also cause individuals to look or act differently
Only those differences encoded in an individuals genes however can pass to its offspring and thus be a
target of natural selection Natural selection works by selecting for alleles that confer beneficial traits or
behaviors while selecting against those for deleterious qualities Genetic drift stems from the chance
occurrence that some individuals in the gene line have more offspring than others When individuals leave or
join the population allele frequencies can change as a result of gene flow Mutations to an individuals DNA
may introduce new variation into a population Allele frequencies can also alter when individuals do not
randomly mate with others in the group
193 Adaptive Evolution
Because natural selection acts to increase the frequency of beneficial alleles and traits while decreasing the
frequency of deleterious qualities it is adaptive evolution Natural selection acts at the individual level selecting
for those that have a higher overall fitness compared to the rest of the population If the fit phenotypes are
those that are similar natural selection will result in stabilizing selection and an overall decrease in the
populations variation Directional selection works to shift a populations variance toward a new fit phenotype
as environmental conditions change In contrast diversifying selection results in increased genetic variance by
selecting for two or more distinct phenotypes
Other types of selection include frequencydependent selection in which individuals with either common
positive frequencydependent selection or rare negative frequencydependent selection are selected
Finally sexual selection results from one sex having more variance in the reproductive success than the other
As a result males and females experience different selective pressures which can often lead to the evolution
of phenotypic differences or sexual dimorphisms between the two

1 Figure 192 In plants violet flower color V is
dominant over white v If p  8 and q  02 in a
population of 500 plants how many individuals would
you expect to be homozygous dominant VV
heterozygous Vv and homozygous recessive vv
How many plants would you expect to have violet
flowers and how many would have white flowers
2 Figure 194 Do you think genetic drift would
happen more quickly on an island or on the
mainland
3 Figure 198 In recent years factories have
become cleaner and less soot is released into the
environment What impact do you think this has had
on the distribution of moth color in the population
