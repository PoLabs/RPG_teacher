The combination of soil nutrients water and carbon dioxide along with sunlight allows plants to grow
The Chemical Composition of Plants
Since plants require nutrients in the form of elements such as carbon and potassium it is important to
understand the chemical composition of plants The majority of volume in a plant cell is water it typically
comprises 80 to 90 percent of the plants total weight Soil is the water source for land plants and can be an
abundant source of water even if it appears dry Plant roots absorb water from the soil through root hairs and
transport it up to the leaves through the xylem As water vapor is lost from the leaves the process of transpiration
and the polarity of water molecules which enables them to form hydrogen bonds draws more water from the
roots up through the plant to the leaves Figure 312 Plants need water to support cell structure for metabolic
functions to carry nutrients and for photosynthesis
Figure 312 Water is absorbed through the root hairs and moves up the xylem to the leaves
Plant cells need essential substances collectively called nutrients to sustain life Plant nutrients may be
composed of either organic or inorganic compounds An organic compound is a chemical compound that
contains carbon such as carbon dioxide obtained from the atmosphere Carbon that was obtained from
atmospheric CO2 composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants An inorganic compound does
not contain carbon and is not part of or produced by a living organism Inorganic substances which form the
majority of the soil solution are commonly called minerals those required by plants include nitrogen N and
potassium K for structure and regulation
Essential Nutrients
Plants require only light water and about 20 elements to support all their biochemical needs these 20 elements
are called essential nutrients Table 311 For an element to be regarded as essential three criteria are
required 1 a plant cannot complete its life cycle without the element 2 no other element can perform the
function of the element and 3 the element is directly involved in plant nutrition
Essential Elements for Plant Growth
Macronutrients
Micronutrients
Carbon C
Iron Fe
Hydrogen H
Manganese Mn
