CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
21 Although there are many different hormones in
the human body they can be divided into three
classes based on their chemical structure What are
these classes and what is one factor that
distinguishes them
22 Where is insulin stored and why would it be
released
23 Glucagon is the peptide hormone that signals for
the body to release glucose into the bloodstream
How does glucagon contribute to maintaining
homeostasis throughout the body What other
hormones are involved in regulating the blood
glucose cycle
24 Name two important functions of hormone
receptors
25 How can hormones mediate changes
26 Why is cAMPmediated signal amplification not
required in steroid hormone signaling Describe how
steroid signaling is amplified instead
27 Name and describe a function of one hormone
produced by the anterior pituitary and one hormone
produced by the posterior pituitary
28 Describe one direct action of growth hormone
GH
29 Researchers have recently demonstrated that
stressed people are more susceptible to contracting
the common cold than people who are not stressed
What kind of stress must the infected patients be
experiencing and why does it make them more
susceptible to the virus
30 How is hormone production and release primarily
controlled
31 Compare and contrast hormonal and humoral
stimuli
32 Oral contraceptive pills work by delivering
synthetic progestins to a woman every day Describe
why this is an effective method of birth control
33 What does aldosterone regulate and how is it
stimulated
34 The adrenal medulla contains two types of
secretory cells what are they and what are their
functions
35 How would damage to the posterior pituitary
gland affect the production and release of ADH and
inhibiting hormones
