KEY TERMS
proportion of population members at specific age ranges
visual display by a species member to discourage other members of the same species or
different species
warning coloration used as a defensive mechanism against predation
type of mimicry where a nonharmful species takes on the warning colorations of a harmful
one
change in an organisms activities in response to a stimulus
study of the biology and evolution of behavior
maximal potential growth rate of a species
number of births within a population at a specific point in time
avoid detection by blending in with the background
number of individuals of a species that can be supported by the limited resources of a
habitat
association of a specific stimulus and response through conditioning
final stage of succession where a stable community is formed by a characteristic
assortment of plant and animal species
knowledge and skills acquired by the manipulation of information in the mind
relationship between species wherein one species benefits from the close prolonged
interaction while the other species neither benefits nor is harmed
no two species within a habitat can coexist when they compete for the same
resources at the same place and time
behavior that becomes associated with a specific stimulus through conditioning
visual display used to attract a mate
number of deaths within a population at a specific point in time
modern model of population dynamics incorporating many features of
the r and Kselection theory
statistical study of changes in populations over time
regulation of population that is influenced by population density such as
crowding effects usually involves biotic factors
regulation of populations by factors that operate independent of population
density such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions usually involves abiotic factors
visual display used to distract predators away from a nesting site
type of mimicry where a harmful species resembles a less harmful one
allocation of energy resources for body maintenance reproduction and parental care
change in the environment caused by natural disasters or human activities
