Field Biologist
Many people hike explore caves scuba dive or climb mountains for recreation People often participate
in these activities hoping to see wildlife Experiencing the outdoors can be incredibly enjoyable and
invigorating What if your job entailed working in the wilderness Field biologists by definition work outdoors
in the field The term field in this case refers to any location outdoors even under water A field biologist
typically focuses research on a certain species group of organisms or a single habitat Figure 184

One objective of many field biologists includes discovering new unrecorded species Not only do such
findings expand our understanding of the natural world but they also lead to important innovations in fields
such as medicine and agriculture Plant and microbial species in particular can reveal new medicinal and
nutritive knowledge Other organisms can play key roles in ecosystems or if rare require protection When
discovered researchers can use these important species as evidence for environmental regulations and
laws
Processes and Patterns of Evolution
Natural selection can only take place if there is variation or differences among individuals in a population
Importantly these differences must have some genetic basis otherwise the selection will not lead to change in
the next generation This is critical because nongenetic reasons can cause variation among individuals such as
an individuals height because of better nutrition rather than different genes
Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms mutation and sexual reproduction Mutation
a change in DNA is the ultimate source of new alleles or new genetic variation in any population The genetic
changes that mutation causes can have one of three outcomes on the phenotype A mutation affects the
organisms phenotype in a way that gives it reduced fitnesslower likelihood of survival or fewer offspring A
mutation may produce a phenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness Many mutations will also have no effect
on the phenotypes fitness We call these neutral mutations Mutations may also have a whole range of effect
sizes on the organisms fitness that expresses them in their phenotype from a small effect to a great effect
Sexual reproduction also leads to genetic diversity when two parents reproduce unique combinations of alleles
assemble to produce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each offspring
We call a heritable trait that helps an organisms survival and reproduction in its present environment an
adaptation Scientists describe groups of organisms adapting to their environment when a genetic variation
occurs over time that increases or maintains the populations fit to its environment A platypuss webbed feet
are an adaptation for swimming A snow leopards thick fur is an adaptation for living in the cold A cheetahs fast
speed is an adaptation for catching prey
