a
Helper T cells release cytokines while
cytotoxic T cells kill the infected cell
b
Helper T cells are CD4 while cytotoxic T
cells are CD8
c
MHC II is a receptor found on most body
cells while MHC I is a receptor found on
immune cells only
d
The T cell receptor is found on both CD4
and CD8 T cells
2 Figure 4214 Based on what you know about MHC
receptors why do you think an organ transplanted
from an incompatible donor to a recipient will be
rejected
3 Figure 4216 The Rh antigen is found on Rh
positive red blood cells An Rhnegative female can
usually carry an Rhpositive fetus to term without
difficulty However if she has a second Rhpositive
fetus her body may launch an immune attack that
causes hemolytic disease of the newborn Why do
you think hemolytic disease is only a problem during
the second or subsequent pregnancies
