Population Ecology
A population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members of the same species living in the same
area at the same time Organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics A
population is identified in part by where it lives and its area of population may have natural or artificial
boundaries Natural boundaries might be rivers mountains or deserts while artificial boundaries may be mowed
grass manmade structures or roads The study of population ecology focuses on the number of individuals in
an area and how and why population size changes over time
For example population ecologists are particularly interested in counting the Karner blue butterfly because
it is classified as a federally endangered species However the distribution and density of this species is
highly influenced by the distribution and abundance of wild lupine and the biophysical environment around it
Researchers might ask questions about the factors leading to the decline of wild lupine and how these affect
Karner blue butterflies For example ecologists know that wild lupine thrives in open areas where trees and
shrubs are largely absent In natural settings intermittent wildfires regularly remove trees and shrubs helping to
maintain the open areas that wild lupine requires Mathematical models can be used to understand how wildfire
suppression by humans has led to the decline of this important plant for the Karner blue butterfly
Community Ecology
A biological community consists of the different species within an area typically a threedimensional space
and the interactions within and among these species Community ecologists are interested in the processes
driving these interactions and their consequences Questions about conspecific interactions often focus on
competition among members of the same species for a limited resource Ecologists also study interactions
between various species members of different species are called heterospecifics Examples of heterospecific
interactions include predation parasitism herbivory competition and pollination These interactions can have
regulating effects on population sizes and can impact ecological and evolutionary processes affecting diversity
For example Karner blue butterfly larvae form mutualistic relationships with ants especially Formica spp
Mutualism is a form of longterm relationship that has coevolved between two species and from which each
species benefits For mutualism to exist between individual organisms each species must receive some benefit
from the other as a consequence of the relationship Researchers have shown that there is an increase in
survival when ants protect Karner blue butterfly larvae caterpillars from predaceous insects and spiders an
act known as tending This might be because the larvae spend less time in each life stage when tended by
ants which provides an advantage for the larvae Meanwhile to attract the ants the Karner blue butterfly larvae
secrete antlike pheromones and a carbohydraterich substance that is an important energy source for the ants
Both the Karner blue larvae and the ants benefit from their interaction although the species of attendant ants
