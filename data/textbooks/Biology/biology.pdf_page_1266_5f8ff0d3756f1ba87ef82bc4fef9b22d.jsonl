Red Blood Cells
Red blood cells or erythrocytes erythro  red cyte  cell are specialized cells that circulate through the
body delivering oxygen to cells they are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow In mammals red blood
cells are small biconcave cells that at maturity do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria and are only 78 m in
size In birds and nonavian reptiles a nucleus is still maintained in red blood cells
The red coloring of blood comes from the ironcontaining protein hemoglobin illustrated in Figure 406a The
principle job of this protein is to carry oxygen but it also transports carbon dioxide as well Hemoglobin is packed
into red blood cells at a rate of about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin per cell Each hemoglobin molecule
binds four oxygen molecules so that each red blood cell carries one billion molecules of oxygen There are
approximately 25 trillion red blood cells in the five liters of blood in the human body which could carry up to
25 sextillion 25  1021 molecules of oxygen in the body at any time In mammals the lack of organelles in
erythrocytes leaves more room for the hemoglobin molecules and the lack of mitochondria also prevents use
of the oxygen for metabolic respiration Only mammals have anucleated red blood cells and some mammals
camels for instance even have nucleated red blood cells The advantage of nucleated red blood cells is that
these cells can undergo mitosis Anucleated red blood cells metabolize anaerobically without oxygen making
use of a primitive metabolic pathway to produce ATP and increase the efficiency of oxygen transport
Not all organisms use hemoglobin as the method of oxygen transport Invertebrates that utilize hemolymph
rather than blood use different pigments to bind to the oxygen These pigments use copper or iron to the oxygen
Invertebrates have a variety of other respiratory pigments Hemocyanin a bluegreen coppercontaining protein
illustrated in Figure 406b is found in mollusks crustaceans and some of the arthropods Chlorocruorin a
greencolored ironcontaining pigment is found in four families of polychaete tubeworms Hemerythrin a red
ironcontaining protein is found in some polychaete worms and annelids and is illustrated in Figure 406c
Despite the name hemerythrin does not contain a heme group and its oxygencarrying capacity is poor
compared to hemoglobin
