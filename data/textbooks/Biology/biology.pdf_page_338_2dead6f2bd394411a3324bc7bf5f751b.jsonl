121  Mendels Experiments and the Laws of
Probability
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the scientific reasons for the success of Mendels experimental work

Describe the expected outcomes of monohybrid crosses involving dominant and recessive alleles

Apply the sum and product rules to calculate probabilities
Figure 122 Johann Gregor Mendel is considered the father of genetics
Johann Gregor Mendel 18221884 Figure 122 was a lifelong learner teacher scientist and man of
faith As a young adult he joined the Augustinian Abbey of St Thomas in Brno in what is now the Czech
Republic Supported by the monastery he taught physics botany and natural science courses at the secondary
and university levels In 1856 he began a decadelong research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in
honeybees and plants ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system a system with convenient
characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems In 1865 Mendel
presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30000 pea plants to the local Natural History Society He
demonstrated that traits are transmitted from parents to offspring independently of other traits and in dominant
and recessive patterns In 1866 he published his work Experiments in Plant Hybridization

Mendels work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community which believed incorrectly that the process
of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in
offspring The blending theory of inheritance asserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by
the blending in the offspring but we now know that this is not the case This hypothetical process appeared to
be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation Continuous variation results from the action
of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height Offspring appear to be a blend of their parents
traits
Instead of continuous characteristics Mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes
specifically violet versus white flowers this is referred to as discontinuous variation Mendels choice of
these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring nor were
