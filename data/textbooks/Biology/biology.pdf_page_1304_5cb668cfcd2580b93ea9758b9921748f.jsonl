Hormones That Affect Osmoregulation
Hormone
Where produced
Function
Angiotensin
Liver
Angiotensin II affects multiple processes and increases blood
pressure
Aldosterone
Adrenal cortex
Prevents loss of sodium and water
Antidiuretic
hormone
vasopressin
Hypothalamus stored
in the posterior
pituitary
Prevents water loss
Atrial natriuretic
peptide
Heart atrium
Decreases blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator and
increasing glomerular filtration rate decreases sodium
reabsorption in kidneys

Epinephrine and Norepinephrine
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are released by the adrenal medulla and nervous system respectively They
are the flightfight hormones that are released when the body is under extreme stress During stress much of
the bodys energy is used to combat imminent danger Kidney function is halted temporarily by epinephrine and
norepinephrine These hormones function by acting directly on the smooth muscles of blood vessels to constrict
them Once the afferent arterioles are constricted blood flow into the nephrons stops These hormones go one
step further and trigger the reninangiotensinaldosterone system
ReninAngiotensinAldosterone
The reninangiotensinaldosterone system illustrated in Figure 4115 proceeds through several steps to
produce angiotensin II which acts to stabilize blood pressure and volume Renin secreted by a part of
the juxtaglomerular complex is produced by the granular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles Thus
the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly Renin acts on angiotensinogen which is made in
the liver and converts it to angiotensin I Angiotensin converting enzyme ACE converts angiotensin I to
angiotensin II Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels It also triggers the release of
the mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex which in turn stimulates the renal tubules to reabsorb
more sodium Angiotensin II also triggers the release of antidiuretic hormone ADH from the hypothalamus
leading to water retention in the kidneys It acts directly on the nephrons and decreases glomerular filtration rate
Medically blood pressure can be controlled by drugs that inhibit ACE called ACE inhibitors
