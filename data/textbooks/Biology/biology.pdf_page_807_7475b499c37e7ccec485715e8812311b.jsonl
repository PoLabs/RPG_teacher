outside of the animal whereas the inner layer from endoderm is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive
cavity In the planula larva a layer of ectoderm surrounds a solid mass of endoderm but as the polyp develops
the digestive or gastrovascular cavity opens within the endoderm A nonliving jellylike mesoglea lies between
these two epithelial layers In terms of cellular complexity cnidarians show the presence of differentiated cell
types in each tissue layer such as nerve cells contractile epithelial cells enzymesecreting cells and nutrient
absorbing cells as well as the presence of intercellular connections However with a few notable exceptions
such as statocysts and rhopalia see below the development of organs or organ systems is not advanced in
this phylum
The nervous system is rudimentary with nerve cells organized in a network scattered across the body This
nerve net may show the presence of groups of cells that form nerve plexi singular plexus or nerve cords
Organization of the nervous system in the motile medusa is more complex than that of the sessile polyp with
a nerve ring around the edge of the medusa bell that controls the action of the tentacles Cnidarian nerve
cells show mixed characteristics of motor and sensory neurons The predominant signaling molecules in these
primitive nervous systems are peptides which perform both excitatory and inhibitory functions Despite the
simplicity of the nervous system it is remarkable that it coordinates the complicated movement of the tentacles
the drawing of captured prey to the mouth the digestion of food and the expulsion of waste
The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus this arrangement
is called an incomplete digestive system In the gastrovascular cavity extracellular digestion occurs as food is
taken into the gastrovascular cavity enzymes are secreted into the cavity and the cells lining the cavity absorb
nutrients However some intracellular digestion also occurs The gastrovascular cavity distributes nutrients
throughout the body of the animal with nutrients passing from the digestive cavity across the mesoglea to the
epidermal cells Thus this cavity serves both digestive and circulatory functions
Cnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis and water in
the environment and between cells in the gastrodermis and water in the gastrovascular cavity The lack of a
circulatory system to move dissolved gases limits the thickness of the body wall and necessitates a nonliving
mesoglea between the layers In the cnidarians with a thicker mesoglea a number of canals help to distribute
both nutrients and gases There is neither an excretory system nor organs and nitrogenous wastes simply
diffuse from the cells into the water outside the animal or into the gastrovascular cavity
The phylum Cnidaria contains about 10000 described species divided into two monophyletic clades the
Anthozoa and the Medusozoa The Anthozoa include the corals sea fans sea whips and the sea anemones
The Medusozoa include several classes of Cnidaria in two clades The Hydrozoa include sessile forms some
medusoid forms and swimming colonial forms like the Portuguese manofwar The other clade contains various
types of jellies including both Scyphozoa and Cubozoa The Anthozoa contain only sessile polyp forms while
the Medusozoa include species with both polyp and medusa forms in their life cycle
Class Anthozoa
The class Anthozoa flower animals includes sea anemones Figure 288 sea pens and corals with an
estimated number of 6100 described species Sea anemones are usually brightly colored and can attain a size
of 18 to 10 cm in diameter Individual animals are cylindrical in shape and are attached directly to a substrate
