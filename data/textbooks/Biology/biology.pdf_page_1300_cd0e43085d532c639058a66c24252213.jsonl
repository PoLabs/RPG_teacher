uric acid freely diffuse into the tubules There are exchange pumps lining the tubules which actively transport
H ions into the cell and K or Na ions out water passively follows to form urine The secretion of ions alters
the osmotic pressure which draws water electrolytes and nitrogenous waste uric acid into the tubules Water
and electrolytes are reabsorbed when these organisms are faced with lowwater environments and uric acid is
excreted as a thick paste or powder Not dissolving wastes in water helps these organisms to conserve water
this is especially important for life in dry environments
Figure 4111 Malpighian tubules of insects and other terrestrial arthropods remove nitrogenous wastes and other
solutes from the hemolymph Na andor K ions are actively transported into the lumen of the tubules Water then
enters the tubules via osmosis forming urine The urine passes through the intestine and into the rectum There
nutrients diffuse back into the hemolymph Na andor K ions are pumped into the hemolymph and water follows
The concentrated waste is then excreted

414  Nitrogenous Wastes
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Compare and contrast the way in which aquatic animals and terrestrial animals can eliminate toxic
ammonia from their systems

Compare the major byproduct of ammonia metabolism in vertebrate animals to that of birds insects and
reptiles
Of the four major macromolecules in biological systems both proteins and nucleic acids contain nitrogen
During the catabolism or breakdown of nitrogencontaining macromolecules carbon hydrogen and oxygen
are extracted and stored in the form of carbohydrates and fats Excess nitrogen is excreted from the body
Nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic ammonia which raises the pH of body fluids The formation of ammonia
itself requires energy in the form of ATP and large quantities of water to dilute it out of a biological system
Animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water Animals that excrete ammonia
are said to be ammonotelic Terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to excrete nitrogenous
