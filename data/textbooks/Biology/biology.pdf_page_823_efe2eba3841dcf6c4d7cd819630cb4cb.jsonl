Bivalvia and Scaphopoda Although each molluscan class appears to be monophyletic their relationship to one
another is unclear and still being reviewed
Both the Caudofoveata and the Solenogastres include shellless wormlike animals primarily found in benthic
marine habitats Although these animals lack a calcareous shell they get some protection from calcareous
spicules embedded in a cuticle that covers their epidermis The mantle cavity is reduced and both groups lack
eyes tentacles and nephridia excretory organs The Caudofoveata possess a radula but the Solenogastres
do not have a radula or gills The foot is also reduced in the Solenogastres and absent from the Caudofoveata
Long thought to be extinct the first living specimens of Monoplacophora Neopilina galatheae were discovered
in 1952 on the ocean bottom near the west coast of Costa Rica Today there are over 25 described species
Members of class Monoplacophora bearing one plate possess a single caplike shell that covers the dorsal
body The morphology of the shell and the underlying animal can vary from circular to ovate They have a simple
radula a looped digestive system multiple pairs of excretory organs and a pair of gonads Multiple gills are
located between the foot and the edge of the mantle
Animals in class Polyplacophora bearing many plates are commonly known as chitons and bear eight limy
plates that make up the dorsal shell Figure 2822 These animals have a broad ventral foot that is adapted
for suction onto rocks and other substrates and a mantle that extends beyond the edge of the shell Calcareous
spines on the exposed mantle edge provide protection from predators Respiration is facilitated by multiple pairs
of gills in the mantle cavity Blood from the gills is collected in a posterior heart and then sent to the rest of
the body in a hemocoelan open circulation system in which the blood is contained in connected chambers
surrounding various organs rather than within individual blood vessels The radula which has teeth composed of
an ultrahard magnetite is used to scrape food organisms off rocky surfaces Chiton teeth have been shown to
exhibit the greatest hardness and stiffness of any biomineral material reported to date being as much as three
times harder than human enamel and the calcium carbonatebased shells of mollusks
The nervous system is rudimentary with only buccal or cheek ganglia present at the anterior end Multiple tiny
sensory structures including photosensors extend from the mantle into channels in the upper layer of the shell
These structures are called esthetes and are unique to the chitons Another sensory structure under the radula
is used to sample the feeding environment A single pair of nephridia is used for the excretion of nitrogenous
wastes

Class Bivalvia twovalves includes clams oysters mussels scallops geoducks and shipworms Some
bivalves are almost microscopic while others in the genus Tridacna may be one meter in length and weigh
225 kilograms Members of this class are found in marine as well as freshwater habitats As the name suggests
bivalves are enclosed in twopart valves or shells Figure 2823a fused on the dorsal side by hinge ligaments
as well as shell teeth on the ventral side that keep the two halves aligned The two shells which consist of an
outer organic layer a middle prismatic layer and a very smooth nacreous layer are joined at the oldest part
of the shell called the umbo Anterior and posterior adductor and abductor muscles close and open the shell
respectively
The overall body of the bivalve is laterally flattened the foot is wedgeshaped and the head region is poorly
developed with no obvious mouth Bivalves are filterfeeders and a radula is absent in this class of mollusks
The mantle cavity is fused along the edges except for openings for the foot and for the intake and expulsion of
