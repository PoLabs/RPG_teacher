extends the ends by copying the RNA template and extending one strand of the chromosome DNA
polymerase can then fill in the complementary DNA strand using the regular replication enzymes In this way
the ends of the chromosomes are protected
146 DNA Repair
DNA polymerase can make mistakes while adding nucleotides It edits the DNA by proofreading every newly
added base Incorrect bases are removed and replaced by the correct base before proceeding with elongation
Most mistakes are corrected during replication although when this does not happen the mismatch repair
mechanism is employed Mismatch repair enzymes recognize the wrongly incorporated base and excise it from
the DNA replacing it with the correct base In yet another type of repair nucleotide excision repair a damaged
base is removed along with a few bases on the 5 and 3 end and these are replaced by copying the template
with the help of DNA polymerase The ends of the newly synthesized fragment are attached to the rest of the
DNA using DNA ligase which creates a phosphodiester bond
Most mistakes are corrected and if they are not they may result in a mutation defined as a permanent change
in the DNA sequence Mutations can be of many types such as substitution deletion insertion and
trinucleotide repeat expansions Mutations in repair genes may lead to serious consequences such as cancer
Mutations can be induced or may occur spontaneously
VISUAL CONNECTION QUESTIONS
1 Figure 1410 In eukaryotic cells DNA and RNA
synthesis occur in a separate compartment from
protein synthesis In prokaryotic cells both processes
occur together What advantages might there be to
separating the processes What advantages might
there be to having them occur together
2 Figure 1414 You isolate a cell strain in which the
joining of Okazaki fragments is impaired and suspect
that a mutation has occurred in an enzyme found at
the replication fork Which enzyme is most likely to
be mutated
3 Figure 1421 A frameshift mutation that results in
the insertion of three nucleotides is often less
deleterious than a mutation that results in the
insertion of one nucleotide Why
