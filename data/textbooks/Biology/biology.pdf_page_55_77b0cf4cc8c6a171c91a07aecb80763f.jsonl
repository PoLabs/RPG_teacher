number of atoms is the same on each side of the equation According to the law of conservation of matter the
number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should be equal such that no atoms are under normal
circumstances created or destroyed
2H2 O2  hydrogen peroxide  2H2 O water  O2  oxygen
Even though all of the reactants and products of this reaction are molecules each atom remains bonded to at
least one other atom in this reaction only hydrogen peroxide and water are representatives of compounds
they contain atoms of more than one type of element Molecular oxygen alternatively as Figure 210 shows
consists of two doubly bonded oxygen atoms and is not classified as a compound but as a hononuclear
molecule
Figure 210 A double bond joins the oxygen atoms in an O2 molecule
Some chemical reactions such as the one above can proceed in one direction until they expend all the
reactants The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible
Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction In reversible reactions reactants turn into
products but when the products concentration goes beyond a certain threshold characteristic of the particular
reaction some of these products convert back into reactants At this point product and reactant designations
reverse This back and forth continues until a certain relative balance between reactants and products occursa
state called equilibrium A chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the reactants
and products often denote these reversible reaction situations
For example in human blood excess hydrogen ions H bind to bicarbonate ions HCO3 forming an
equilibrium state with carbonic acid H2CO3 If we added carbonic acid to this system some of it would convert
to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions
HCO3
 H H2 CO3
However biological reactions rarely obtain equilibrium because the concentrations of the reactants or products
or both are constantly changing often with one reactions product a reactant for another To return to the example
of excess hydrogen ions in the blood forming carbonic acid will be the reactions major direction However
the carbonic acid can also leave the body as carbon dioxide gas via exhalation instead of converting back to
bicarbonate ion thus driving the reaction to the right by the law of mass action These reactions are important
for maintaining homeostasis in our blood

Ions and Ionic Bonds
Some atoms are more stable when they gain or lose an electron or possibly two and form ions This fills their
outermost electron shell and makes them energetically more stable Because the number of electrons does not
equal the number of protons each ion has a net charge Cations are positive ions that form by losing electrons
Negative ions form by gaining electrons which we call anions We designate anions by their elemental name
and change the ending to ide thus the anion of chlorine is chloride and the anion of sulfur is sulfide
Scientists refer to this movement of electrons from one element to another as electron transfer As Figure 211
illustrates sodium Na only has one electron in its outer electron shell It takes less energy for sodium to donate
that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell If sodium loses an electron
it now has 11 protons 11 neutrons and only 10 electrons leaving it with an overall charge of 1 We now refer
to it as a sodium ion Chlorine Cl in its lowest energy state called the ground state has seven electrons in its
outer shell Again it is more energyefficient for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven Therefore it
tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons 17 neutrons and 18 electrons giving it a net negative
1 charge We now refer to it as a chloride ion In this example sodium will donate its one electron to empty its
shell and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete
outermost shells Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons each is now an
