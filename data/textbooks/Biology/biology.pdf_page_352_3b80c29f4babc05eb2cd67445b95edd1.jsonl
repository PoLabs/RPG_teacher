Eye color in Drosophila was one of the first Xlinked traits to be identified Thomas Hunt Morgan mapped this trait
to the X chromosome in 1910 Like humans Drosophila males have an XY chromosome pair and females are
XX In flies the wildtype eye color is red XW and it is dominant to white eye color Xw Figure 1211 Because
of the location of the eyecolor gene reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios Males are
said to be hemizygous because they have only one allele for any Xlinked characteristic Hemizygosity makes
the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for XY males Drosophila males lack a second allele
copy on the Y chromosome that is their genotype can only be XWY or XwY In contrast females have two allele
copies of this gene and can be XWXW XWXw or XwXw
Figure 1211 In Drosophila several genes determine eye color The genes for white and vermilion eye colors are
located on the X chromosome Others are located on the autosomes Clockwise from top left are brown cinnabar
sepia vermilion white and red Red eye color is wildtype and is dominant to white eye color
In an Xlinked cross the genotypes of F1 and F2 offspring depend on whether the recessive trait was expressed
by the male or the female in the P1 generation With regard to Drosophila eye color when the P1 male expresses
the whiteeye phenotype and the female is homozygous redeyed all members of the F1 generation exhibit red
eyes Figure 1212 The F1 females are heterozygous XWXw and the males are all XWY having received
their X chromosome from the homozygous dominant P1 female and their Y chromosome from the P1 male A
subsequent cross between the XWXw female and the XWY male would produce only redeyed females with
XWXW or XWXw genotypes and both red and whiteeyed males with XWY or XwY genotypes Now consider
a cross between a homozygous whiteeyed female and a male with red eyes The F1 generation would exhibit
only heterozygous redeyed females XWXw and only whiteeyed males XwY Half of the F2 females would be
redeyed XWXw and half would be whiteeyed XwXw Similarly half of the F2 males would be redeyed XWY
and half would be whiteeyed XwY
