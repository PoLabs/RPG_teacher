Figure 106 Karyokinesis or mitosis is divided into five stagesprophase prometaphase metaphase anaphase
and telophase We should note that this is a continuous process and that the divisions between the stages are
not discrete The pictures at the bottom were taken by fluorescence microscopy hence the black background of
cells artificially stained by fluorescent dyes blue fluorescence indicates DNA chromosomes and green fluorescence
indicates microtubules spindle apparatus credit mitosis drawings modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal

Prophase the first phase the nuclear envelope starts to dissociate into small vesicles and the membranous
organelles such as the Golgi complex Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum fragment and disperse
toward the periphery of the cell The nucleolus disappears disperses as well and the centrosomes begin
to move to opposite poles of the cell Microtubules that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the
centrosomes pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen The sister chromatids begin to coil
more tightly with the aid of condensin proteins and now become visible under a light microscope
Prometaphase the first change phase Many processes that began in prophase continue to advance The
remnants of the nuclear envelope fragment further and the mitotic spindle continues to develop as more
microtubules assemble and stretch across the length of the former nuclear area Chromosomes become even
more condensed and discrete Each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in
its centromeric region Figure 107 The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind to the mitotic spindle
microtubules As the spindle microtubules extend from the centrosomes some of these microtubules come into
contact with and firmly bind to the kinetochores Once a mitotic fiber attaches to a chromosome the chromosome
will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids face the opposite poles Eventually all the sister
chromatids will be attached via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles Spindle microtubules
that do not engage the chromosomes are called polar microtubules These microtubules overlap each other
midway between the two poles and contribute to cell elongation Astral microtubules are located near the poles
aid in spindle orientation and are required for the regulation of mitosis
