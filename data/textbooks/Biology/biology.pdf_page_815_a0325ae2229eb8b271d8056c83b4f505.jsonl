Diversity of Flatworms
The flatworms have been traditionally divided into four classes Turbellaria Monogenea Trematoda and
Cestoda Figure 2815 However the relationships among members of these classes has recently been
reassessed with the turbellarians in particular now viewed as paraphyletic since its descendants may also
include members of the other three classes Members of the clade or class Rhabditophora are now dispersed
among multiple orders of Platyhelminthes the most familiar of these being the Polycladida which contains
the large marine flatworms the Tricladida which includes Dugesia planaria and Planaria and its relatives
and the major parasitic orders Monogenea fish ectoparasites Trematoda flukes and Cestoda tapeworms
which together form a monophyletic clade
