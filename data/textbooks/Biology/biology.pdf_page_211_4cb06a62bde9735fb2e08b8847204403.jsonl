Figure 72 The oxidized form of the electron carrier NAD is shown on the left and the reduced form NADH is
shown on the right The nitrogenous base in NADH has one more hydrogen ion and two more electrons than in NAD
ATP in Living Systems
A living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy Excess free energy would result in an increase of
heat in the cell which would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell
Rather a cell must be able to handle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release
it for use only as needed Living cells accomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate ATP
ATP is often called the energy currency of the cell and like currency this versatile compound can be used to
fill any energy need of the cell How It functions similarly to a rechargeable battery
When ATP is broken down usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group energy is released The
energy is used to do work by the cell usually when the released phosphate binds to another molecule thereby
activating it For example in the mechanical work of muscle contraction ATP supplies the energy to move the
contractile muscle proteins Recall the active transport work of the sodiumpotassium pump in cell membranes
ATP alters the structure of the integral protein that functions as the pump changing its affinity for sodium and
potassium In this way the cell performs work pumping ions against their electrochemical gradients
ATP Structure and Function
At the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate AMP which is composed of an adenine
molecule bonded to a ribose molecule and to a single phosphate group Figure 73 Ribose is a fivecarbon
sugar found in RNA and AMP is one of the nucleotides in RNA The addition of a second phosphate group to
this core molecule results in the formation of adenosine diphosphate ADP the addition of a third phosphate
group forms adenosine triphosphate ATP
