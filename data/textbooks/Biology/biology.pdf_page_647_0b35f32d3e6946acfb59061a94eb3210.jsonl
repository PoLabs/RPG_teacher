232  Characteristics of Protists
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the cell structure characteristics of protists

Describe the metabolic diversity of protists

Describe the life cycle diversity of protists
There are over 100000 described living species of protists and it is unclear how many undescribed species may
exist Since many protists live as commensals or parasites in other organisms and these relationships are often
speciesspecific there is a huge potential for protist diversity that matches the diversity of their hosts Because
the name protist serves as a catchall term for eukaryotic organisms that are not animal plant or fungi it is not
surprising that very few characteristics are common to all protists On the other hand familiar characteristics of
plants and animals are foreshadowed in various protists
Cell Structure
The cells of protists are among the most elaborate of all cells Multicellular plants animals and fungi are
embedded among the protists in eukaryotic phylogeny In most plants and animals and some fungi complexity
arises out of multicellularity tissue specialization and subsequent interaction because of these features
Although a rudimentary form of multicellularity exists among some of the organisms labelled as protists those
that have remained unicellular show how complexity can evolve in the absence of true multicellularity with the
differentiation of cellular morphology and function A few protists live as colonies that behave in some ways
as a group of freeliving cells and in other ways as a multicellular organism Some protists are composed of
enormous multinucleate single cells that look like amorphous blobs of slime or in other cases like ferns In
some species of protists the nuclei are different sizes and have distinct roles in protist cell function
Single protist cells range in size from less than a micrometer to three meters in length to hectares Protist cells
may be enveloped by animallike cell membranes or plantlike cell walls Others are encased in glassy silica
based shells or wound with pellicles of interlocking protein strips The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of
armor preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion
Metabolism
Protists exhibit many forms of nutrition and may be aerobic or anaerobic Those that store energy by
photosynthesis belong to a group of photoautotrophs and are characterized by the presence of chloroplasts
Other protists are heterotrophic and consume organic materials such as other organisms to obtain nutrition
Amoebas and some other heterotrophic protist species ingest particles by a process called phagocytosis in
which the cell membrane engulfs a food particle and brings it inward pinching off an intracellular membranous
sac or vesicle called a food vacuole Figure 237 In some protists food vacuoles can be formed anywhere
on the body surface whereas in others they may be restricted to the base of a specialized feeding structure
The vesicle containing the ingested particle the phagosome then fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic
enzymes to produce a phagolysosome and the food particle is broken down into small molecules that can
diffuse into the cytoplasm and be used in cellular metabolism Undigested remains ultimately are expelled from
the cell via exocytosis
