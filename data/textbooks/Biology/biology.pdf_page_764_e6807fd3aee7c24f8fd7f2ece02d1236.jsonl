course of the five trials and compare and contrast them to the average number of visits that flies made to the
unsprayedcontrol flowers Can you draw any conclusions regarding the attraction of the flies to the sprayed
flowers
Compare and contrast the average number of visits that flies made to the two flower types Can you draw
any conclusions about whether the appearance of the flower had any impact on the attraction of flies Did
smell override any appearance differences or were the flies attracted to one flower type more than another
Form a conclusion Do the results support the hypothesis If not how can your observations be explained
The Importance of Seed Plants in Human Life
Seed plants are the foundation of human diets across the world Figure 2622 Many societies eat almost
exclusively vegetarian fare and depend solely on seed plants for their nutritional needs A few crops rice
wheat and potatoes dominate the agricultural landscape Many crops were developed during the agricultural
revolution when human societies made the transition from nomadic huntergatherers to horticulture and
agriculture Cereals rich in carbohydrates provide the staple of many human diets Beans and nuts supply
proteins Fats are derived from crushed seeds as is the case for peanut and rapeseed canola oils or fruits
such as olives Animal husbandry also consumes large quantities of crop plants
Staple crops are not the only food derived from seed plants Various fruits and vegetables provide nutrient
macromolecules vitamins minerals and fiber Sugar to sweeten dishes is produced from the monocot
sugarcane and the eudicot sugar beet Drinks are made from infusions of tea leaves chamomile flowers
crushed coffee beans or powdered cocoa beans Spices come from many different plant parts saffron and
cloves are stamens and buds black pepper and vanilla are seeds the bark of a bush in the Laurales family
supplies cinnamon and the herbs that flavor many dishes come from dried leaves and fruit such as the pungent
red chili pepper The volatile oils of a number of flowers and bark provide the scent of perfumes
Additionally no discussion of seed plant contribution to human diet would be complete without the mention
of alcohol Fermentation of plantderived sugars and starches is used to produce alcoholic beverages in all
societies In some cases the beverages are derived from the fermentation of sugars from fruit as with wines
and in other cases from the fermentation of carbohydrates derived from seeds as with beers The sharing of
foods and beverages also contributes to human social ritual
Seed plants have many other uses including providing wood as a source of timber for construction fuel and
material to build furniture Most paper is derived from the pulp of coniferous trees Fibers of seed plants such
as cotton flax and hemp are woven into cloth Textile dyes such as indigo were mostly of plant origin until the
advent of synthetic chemical dyes
Lastly it is more difficult to quantify the benefits of ornamental seed plants These grace private and public
spaces adding beauty and serenity to human lives and inspiring painters and poets alike
