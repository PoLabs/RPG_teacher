Coevolution of Land Plants and Mycorrhizae
As we have seen mycorrhizae are the fungal partners of a mutually beneficial symbiotic association that
coevolved between roots of vascular plants and fungi A wellsupported theory proposes that fungi were
instrumental in the evolution of the root system in plants and contributed to the success of Angiosperms
The bryophytes mosses and liverworts which are considered the most ancestral plants and the first to
survive and adapt on land have simple underground rhizoids rather than a true root system and therefore
cannot survive in dry areas However some bryophytes have arbuscular mycorrhizae and some do not
True roots first appeared in the ancestral vascular plants Vascular plants that developed a system of thin
extensions from their roots would have had a selective advantage over nonvascular plants because they
had a greater surface area of contact with the fungal partners than did the rhizoids of mosses and liverworts
The first true roots would have allowed vascular plants to obtain more water and nutrients in the ground
Fossil records indicate that fungi actually preceded the invasion of ancestral freshwater plants onto dry land
The first association between fungi and photosynthetic organisms on land involved mosslike plants and
endophytes These early associations developed before roots appeared in plants Slowly the benefits of the
endophyte and rhizoid interactions for both partners led to presentday mycorrhizae About 90 percent of
todays vascular plants have associations with fungi in their rhizosphere
The fungi involved in mycorrhizae display many characteristics of ancestral fungi they produce simple
spores show little diversification do not have a sexual reproductive cycle and cannot live outside of a
mycorrhizal association The plants benefited from the association because mycorrhizae allowed them to
move into new habitats and allowed the increased uptake of nutrients which gave them an enormous
selective advantage over plants that did not establish symbiotic relationships
Lichens
Lichens display a range of colors and textures Figure 2423 and can survive in the most unusual and hostile
habitats They cover rocks gravestones tree bark and the ground in the tundra where plant roots cannot
penetrate Lichens can survive extended periods of drought when they become completely desiccated and then
rapidly become active once water is available again
