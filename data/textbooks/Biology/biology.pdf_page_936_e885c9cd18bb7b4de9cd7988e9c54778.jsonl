305  Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Define water potential and explain how it is influenced by solutes pressure gravity and the matric
potential

Describe how water potential evapotranspiration and stomatal regulation influence how water is
transported in plants

Explain how photosynthates are transported in plants
The structure of plant roots stems and leaves facilitates the transport of water nutrients and photosynthates
throughout the plant The phloem and xylem are the main tissues responsible for this movement Water potential
evapotranspiration and stomatal regulation influence how water and nutrients are transported in plants To
understand how these processes work we must first understand the energetics of water potential
Water Potential
Plants are phenomenal hydraulic engineers Using only the basic laws of physics and the simple manipulation
of potential energy plants can move water to the top of a 116metertall tree Figure 3031a Plants can also
use hydraulics to generate enough force to split rocks and buckle sidewalks Figure 3031b Plants achieve this
because of water potential
Figure 3031 With heights nearing 116 meters a coastal redwoods Sequoia sempervirens are the tallest trees in the
world Plant roots can easily generate enough force to b buckle and break concrete sidewalks much to the dismay of
homeowners and city maintenance departments credit a modification of work by Bernt Rostad credit b modification

Water potential is a measure of the potential energy in water Plant physiologists are not interested in the energy
in any one particular aqueous system but are very interested in water movement between two systems In
practical terms therefore water potential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and
pure water at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature Water potential is denoted by the Greek letter
 psi and is expressed in units of pressure pressure is a form of energy called megapascals MPa The
potential of pure water wpure H2O is by convenience of definition designated a value of zero even though
pure water contains plenty of potential energy that energy is ignored Water potential values for the water in a
plant root stem or leaf are therefore expressed relative to wpure H2O
The water potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration pressure gravity and factors called
matrix effects Water potential can be broken down into its individual components using the following equation
system  total  s  p  g  m
where s p g and m refer to the solute pressure gravity and matric potentials respectively System
