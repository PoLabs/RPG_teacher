point where some may be in danger of collapse The depletion of the ozone layer erosion due to acid rain
and damage from global climate change are caused by human activities The ultimate effect of these changes
on our carrying capacity is unknown As some point out it is likely that the negative effects of increasing
carrying capacity will outweigh the positive onesthe worlds carrying capacity for human beings might actually
decrease
The human population is currently experiencing exponential growth even though human reproduction is far
below its biotic potential Figure 4514 To reach its biotic potential all females would have to become pregnant
every nine months or so during their reproductive years Also resources would have to be such that the
environment would support such growth Neither of these two conditions exists In spite of this fact human
population is still growing exponentially
Figure 4514 Human population growth since 1000 AD is exponential dark blue line Notice that while the population
in Asia yellow line which has many economically underdeveloped countries is increasing exponentially the
population in Europe light blue line where most of the countries are economically developed is growing much more
slowly
A consequence of exponential human population growth is a reduction in time that it takes to add a particular
number of humans to the Earth Figure 4515 shows that 123 years were necessary to add 1 billion humans
in 1930 but it only took 24 years to add two billion people between 1975 and 1999 As already discussed
our ability to increase our carrying capacity indefinitely my be limited Without new technological advances the
human growth rate has been predicted to slow in the coming decades However the population will still be
increasing and the threat of overpopulation remains
