Male and female gametangia develop at the tip of separate gametophores The antheridia male organs
produce many sperm whereas the archegonia the female organs each form a single egg at the base venter
of a flaskshaped structure The archegonium produces attractant substances and at fertilization the sperm
swims down the neck to the venter and unites with the egg inside the archegonium The zygote protected by
the archegonium divides and grows into a sporophyte still attached by its foot to the gametophyte
