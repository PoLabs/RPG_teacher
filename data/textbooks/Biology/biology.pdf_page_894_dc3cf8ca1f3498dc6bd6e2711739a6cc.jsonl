cynodonts and mammals The jawbone also shows changes from early synapsids to later ones The zygomatic
arch or cheekbone is present in mammals and advanced therapsids such as cynodonts but is not present in
pelycosaurs The presence of the zygomatic arch suggests the presence of masseter muscles which close the
jaw and function in chewing
In the appendicular skeleton the shoulder girdle of therian mammals is modified from that of other vertebrates
in that it does not possess a procoracoid bone or an interclavicle and the scapula is the dominant bone
Mammals evolved from therapsids in the late Triassic period as the earliest known mammal fossils are
from the early Jurassic period some 205 million years ago One group of transitional mammals was the
morganucodonts small nocturnal insectivores The jaws of morganucodonts were transitional with features
of both reptilian and mammalian jaws Figure 2939 Like modern mammals the morganucodonts had
differentiated teeth and were diphyodonts Mammals first began to diversify in the Mesozoic era from the
Jurassic to the Cretaceous periods Even some small gliding mammals appear in the fossil record during this
time period However most of the Jurassic mammals were extinct by the end of the Mesozoic During the
Cretaceous period another radiation of mammals began and continued through the Cenozoic era about 65
million years ago

Living Mammals
There are three major groups of living mammals monotremes prototheria marsupials metatheria and
placental eutheria mammals The eutherians and the marsupials together comprise a clade of therian
mammals with the monotremes forming a sister clade to both metatherians and eutherians
There are very few living species of monotremes the platypus and four species of echidnas or spiny anteaters
The leatherybeaked platypus belongs to the family Ornithorhynchidae bird beak whereas echidnas belong
to the family Tachyglossidae sticky tongue Figure 2940 The platypus and one species of echidna are
found in Australia and the other species of echidna are found in New Guinea Monotremes are unique among
mammals because they lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young The shells of their eggs are not like the
hard shells of birds but have a leathery shell similar to the shells of reptile eggs Monotremes retain their eggs
through about twothirds of the developmental period and then lay them in nests A yolksac placenta helps
support development The babies hatch in a fetal state and complete their development in the nest nourished
by milk secreted by mammary glands opening directly to the skin Monotremes except for young platypuses
do not have teeth Body temperature in the three monotreme species is maintained at about 30C considerably
lower than the average body temperature of marsupial and placental mammals which are typically between 35
and 38C
