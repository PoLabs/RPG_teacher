and plant cells While both animal and plant cells have microtubule organizing centers MTOCs animal cells
also have centrioles associated with the MTOC a complex we call the centrosome Animal cells each have a
centrosome and lysosomes whereas most plant cells do not Plant cells have a cell wall chloroplasts and other
specialized plastids and a large central vacuole whereas animal cells do not
The Centrosome
The centrosome is a microtubuleorganizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells It contains a pair of
centrioles two structures that lie perpendicular to each other Figure 415 Each centriole is a cylinder of nine
triplets of microtubules
Figure 415 The centrosome consists of two centrioles that lie at right angles to each other Each centriole is a cylinder
comprised of nine triplets of microtubules Nontubulin proteins indicated by the green lines hold the microtubule
triplets together
The centrosome the organelle where all microtubules originate replicates itself before a cell divides and the
centrioles appear to have some role in pulling the duplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of the dividing cell
However the centrioles exact function in cell division isnt clear because cells that have had the centrosome
removed can still divide and plant cells which lack centrosomes are capable of cell division
Lysosomes
Animal cells have another set of organelles that most plant cells do not lysosomes The lysosomes are the
cells garbage disposal In plant cells the digestive processes take place in vacuoles Enzymes within the
lysosomes aid in breaking down proteins polysaccharides lipids nucleic acids and even wornout organelles
These enzymes are active at a much lower pH than the cytoplasms Therefore the pH within lysosomes is more
acidic than the cytoplasms pH Many reactions that take place in the cytoplasm could not occur at a low pH so
again the advantage of compartmentalizing the eukaryotic cell into organelles is apparent
The Cell Wall
If you examine Figure 48 the plant cell diagram you will see a structure external to the plasma membrane
This is the cell wall a rigid covering that protects the cell provides structural support and gives shape to the
cell Fungal and some protistan cells also have cell walls While the prokaryotic cell walls chief component is
peptidoglycan the major organic molecule in the plant and some protists cell wall is cellulose Figure 416 a
polysaccharide comprised of glucose units Have you ever noticed that when you bite into a raw vegetable like
celery it crunches Thats because you are tearing the celery cells rigid cell walls with your teeth
Figure 416 Cellulose is a long chain of glucose molecules connected by a 14 linkage The dashed lines at each
end of the figure indicate a series of many more glucose units The size of the page makes it impossible to portray an
entire cellulose molecule
