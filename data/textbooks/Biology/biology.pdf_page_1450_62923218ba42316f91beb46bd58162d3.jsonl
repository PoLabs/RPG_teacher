electric barriers have been successfully used to discourage their migration however the threat is significant
enough that several states and Canada have sued to have the Chicago channel permanently cut off from
Lake Michigan Local and national politicians have weighed in on how to solve the problem but no one
knows whether the Asian carp will ultimately be considered a nuisance like other invasive species such as
the water hyacinth and zebra mussel or whether it will be the destroyer of the largest freshwater fishery of
the world
The issues associated with Asian carp show how population and community ecology fisheries
management and politics intersect on issues of vital importance to the human food supply and economy
Sociopolitical issues like this make extensive use of the sciences of population ecology the study of
members of a particular species occupying a particular area known as a habitat and community ecology
the study of the interaction of all species within a habitat
Community Dynamics
Community dynamics are the changes in community structure and composition over time Sometimes these
changes are induced by environmental disturbances such as volcanoes earthquakes storms fires and
climate change Communities with a stable structure are said to be at equilibrium Following a disturbance the
community may or may not return to the equilibrium state
Succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time
In primary succession newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things in secondary
succession part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain
Primary Succession and Pioneer Species
Primary succession occurs when new land is formed or rock is exposed for example following the eruption
of volcanoes such as those on the Big Island of Hawaii As lava flows into the ocean new land is continually
being formed On the Big Island approximately 32 acres of land is added each year First weathering and other
natural forces break down the substrate enough for the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with
few soil requirements known as pioneer species Figure 4532 These species help to further break down
the mineral rich lava into soil where other less hardy species will grow and eventually replace the pioneer
species In addition as these early species grow and die they add to an evergrowing layer of decomposing
organic material and contribute to soil formation Over time the area will reach an equilibrium state with a set of
organisms quite different from the pioneer species

Secondary succession
A classic example of secondary succession occurs in oak and hickory forests cleared by wildfire Figure 4533
Wildfires will burn most vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area Their nutrients however are
returned to the ground in the form of ash Thus even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires the area
will soon be ready for new life to take hold
Before the fire the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource
sunlight Their height gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other lowlying species
