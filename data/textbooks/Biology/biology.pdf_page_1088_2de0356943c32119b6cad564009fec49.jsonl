Figure 3512 The action potential is conducted down the axon as the axon membrane depolarizes then repolarizes

Myelin and the Propagation of the Action Potential
For an action potential to communicate information to another neuron it must travel along the axon and reach
the axon terminals where it can initiate neurotransmitter release The speed of conduction of an action potential
along an axon is influenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axons resistance to current leak Myelin
acts as an insulator that prevents current from leaving the axon this increases the speed of action potential
conduction In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis action potential conduction slows because current
leaks from previously insulated axon areas The nodes of Ranvier illustrated in Figure 3513 are gaps in the
myelin sheath along the axon These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer long and contain voltage
gated Na and K channels Flow of ions through these channels particularly the Na channels regenerates the
action potential over and over again along the axon This jumping of the action potential from one node to the
next is called saltatory conduction If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon the action potential
would propagate very slowly since Na and K channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials
at every point along the axon instead of at specific points Nodes of Ranvier also save energy for the neuron
since the channels only need to be present at the nodes and not along the entire axon
