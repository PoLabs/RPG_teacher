Isotonic Solutions
In an isotonic solution the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell If the cells osmolarity matches
that of the extracellular fluid there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell although water will still
move in and out Blood cells and plant cells in hypertonic isotonic and hypotonic solutions take on characteristic
appearances Figure 512

A doctor injects a patient with what the doctor thinks is an isotonic saline solution The patient dies and
an autopsy reveals that many red blood cells have been destroyed Do you think the solution the doctor
injected was really isotonic

Tonicity in Living Systems
In a hypotonic environment water enters a cell and the cell swells In an isotonic condition the relative solute
and solvent concentrations are equal on both membrane sides There is no net water movement therefore there
is no change in the cells size In a hypertonic solution water leaves a cell and the cell shrinks If either the hypo
or hyper condition goes to excess the cells functions become compromised and the cell may be destroyed
A red blood cell will burst or lyse when it swells beyond the plasma membranes capability to expand
Remember the membrane resembles a mosaic with discrete spaces between the molecules comprising it If
the cell swells and the spaces between the lipids and proteins become too large the cell will break apart
In contrast when excessive water amounts leave a red blood cell the cell shrinks or crenates This has the
effect of concentrating the solutes left in the cell making the cytosol denser and interfering with diffusion within
the cell The cells ability to function will be compromised and may also result in the cells death
Various living things have ways of controlling the effects of osmosisa mechanism we call osmoregulation
Some organisms such as plants fungi bacteria and some protists have cell walls that surround the plasma
membrane and prevent cell lysis in a hypotonic solution The plasma membrane can only expand to the
