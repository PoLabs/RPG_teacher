Figure 3029 The a Venus flytrap has modified leaves that can capture insects When an unlucky insect touches
the trigger hairs inside the leaf the trap suddenly closes The opening of the b pitcher plant is lined with a
slippery wax Insects crawling on the lip slip and fall into a pool of water in the bottom of the pitcher where they
are digested by bacteria The plant then absorbs the smaller molecules credit a modification of work by Peter

Many swamp plants have adaptations that enable them to thrive in wet areas where their roots grow
submerged underwater In these aquatic areas the soil is unstable and little oxygen is available to reach
the roots Trees such as mangroves Rhizophora sp growing in coastal waters produce aboveground
roots that help support the tree Figure 3030 Some species of mangroves as well as cypress trees
have pneumatophores upwardgrowing roots containing pores and pockets of tissue specialized for gas
exchange Wild rice is an aquatic plant with large air spaces in the root cortex The airfilled tissuecalled
aerenchymaprovides a path for oxygen to diffuse down to the root tips which are embedded in oxygen
poor bottom sediments
Figure 3030 The branches of a mangrove trees develop aerial roots which descend to the ground and
help to anchor the trees b Cypress trees and some mangrove species have upwardgrowing roots called
pneumatophores that are involved in gas exchange Aquatic plants such as c wild rice have large spaces in the
root cortex called aerenchyma visualized here using scanning electron microscopy credit a modification of work
