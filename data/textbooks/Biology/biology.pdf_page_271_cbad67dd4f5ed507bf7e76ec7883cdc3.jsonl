92  Propagation of the Signal
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how the binding of a ligand initiates signal transduction throughout a cell

Recognize the role of phosphorylation in the transmission of intracellular signals

Evaluate the role of second messengers in signal transmission
Once a ligand binds to a receptor the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm
Continuation of a signal in this manner is called signal transduction Signal transduction only occurs with cell
surface receptors which cannot interact with most components of the cell such as DNA Only internal receptors
are able to interact directly with DNA in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis
When a ligand binds to its receptor conformational changes occur that affect the receptors intracellular domain
Conformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane
region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins In some cases
binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor which means that two receptors bind to each other
to form a stable complex called a dimer A dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules often
identical join together The binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come
into close contact and activate each other
Binding Initiates a Signaling Pathway
After the ligand binds to the cellsurface receptor the activation of the receptors intracellular components sets
off a chain of events that is called a signaling pathway sometimes called a signaling cascade In a signaling
pathway second messengersenzymesand activated proteins interact with specific proteins which are in turn
activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a change in the cells environment Figure 910 such as
an increase in metabolism or specific gene expression The events in the cascade occur in a series much like a
current flows in a river Interactions that occur before a certain point are defined as upstream events and events
after that point are called downstream events
