Amoebozoa
Like the Archaeplastida the Amoebozoa include species with single cells species with large multinucleated
cells and species that have multicellular phases Amoebozoan cells characteristically exhibit pseudopodia that
extend like tubes or flat lobes These pseudopods project outward from anywhere on the cell surface and can
anchor to a substrate The protist then transports its cytoplasm into the pseudopod thereby moving the entire
cell This type of motion is similar to the cytoplasmic streaming used to move organelles in the Archaeplastida
and is also used by other protists as a means of locomotion or as a method to distribute nutrients and oxygen
The Amoebozoa include both freeliving and parasitic species
Gymnomoebae
The Gymnamoeba or lobose amoebae include both naked amoebae like the familiar Amoeba proteus and
shelled amoebae whose bodies protrude like snails from their protective tests Amoeba proteus is a large
amoeba about 500 m in diameter but is dwarfed by the multinucleate amoebae Pelomyxa which can be 10
times its size Although Pelomyxa may have hundreds of nuclei it has lost its mitochondria but replaced them
with bacterial endosymbionts The secondary loss or modification of mitochondria is a feature also seen in other
protist groups
Figure 2313 Amoeba Amoebae with tubular and lobeshaped pseudopodia are seen under a microscope These
isolates would be morphologically classified as amoebozoans
Slime Molds
A subset of the amoebozoans the slime molds has several morphological similarities to fungi that are thought
to be the result of convergent evolution For instance during times of stress some slime molds develop into
sporegenerating fruiting bodies much like fungi
The slime molds are categorized on the basis of their life cycles into plasmodial or cellular types Plasmodial
slime molds are composed of large multinucleate cells and move along surfaces like an amorphous blob of
slime during their feeding stage Figure 2314 Food particles are lifted and engulfed into the slime mold as it
glides along The dog vomit slime mold seen in Figure 2314 is a particularly colorful specimen and its ability
to creep about might well trigger suspicion of alien invasion Upon maturation the plasmodium takes on a net
like appearance with the ability to form fruiting bodies or sporangia during times of stress Haploid spores are
