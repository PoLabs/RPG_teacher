many of the genes that support neural development in other animals are absent from the Ctenophore genome
The muscle cells are restricted to the mouth and tentacles and are derived from cells in the mesoglea The
mitochondrial genome of the Ctenophores is small and lacks many genes found in other animal mitochondrial
genomes These features plus the absence of Hox genes from the Ctenophores have been used to argue that
the Ctenophores should be considered basal or as a sister group of the Porifera and that the evolution of
specialized nerve and muscle tissue may have occurred more than once in the history of animal life Although
Ctenophores have been shown as basal to other animals in the phylogeny presented in Chapter 272 debate
on this issue is likely to continue as Ctenophores are more closely studied
Changes to the phylogenetic tree can be difficult to track and understand and are evidence of the process
of science Data and analytical methods play a significant role in the development of phylogenies For this
reason  because molecular analysis and reanalysis are not complete  we cannot necessarily dismiss a
former phylogenetic tree as inaccurate A recent reanalysis of molecular evidence by an international group of
evolutionary biologists refuted the proposition that comb jellies are the phylogenetically oldest extant metazoan
group The study which relied on more sophisticated methods of analyzing the original genetic data reaffirms
the traditional view that the sponges were indeed the first phylum to diverge from the common ancestor of
metazoans The ongoing discussion concerning the location of sponges and comb jellies on the animal family
tree is an example of what drives science forward
274  The Evolutionary History of the Animal Kingdom
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe the features that characterized the earliest animals and approximately when they appeared on
earth

Explain the significance of the Cambrian period for animal evolution and the changes in animal diversity
that took place during that time

Describe some of the unresolved questions surrounding the Cambrian explosion

Discuss the implications of mass animal extinctions that have occurred in evolutionary history
Many questions regarding the origins and evolutionary history of the animal kingdom continue to be researched
and debated as new fossil and molecular evidence change prevailing theories Some of these questions include
the following How long have animals existed on Earth What were the earliest members of the animal kingdom
and what organism was their common ancestor While animal diversity increased during the Cambrian period of
the Paleozoic era 530 million years ago modern fossil evidence suggests that primitive animal species existed
much earlier
PreCambrian Animal Life
The time before the Cambrian period is known as the Ediacaran Period from about 635 million years ago to
543 million years ago the final period of the late Proterozoic Neoproterozoic Era Figure 2714 Ediacaran
fossils were first found in the Ediacaran hills of Southern Australia There are no living representatives of these
species which have left impressions that look like those of feathers or coins Figure 2715 It is believed that
early animal life termed Ediacaran biota evolved from protists at this time
