drugs such as acyclovir can reduce the number and duration of episodes of active viral disease during which
patients develop viral lesions in their skin cells As the virus remains latent in nervous tissue of the body for life
this drug is not curative but can make the symptoms of the disease more manageable For influenza drugs like
Tamiflu oseltamivir Figure 2115 can reduce the duration of flu symptoms by one or two days but the drug
does not prevent symptoms entirely Tamiflu works by inhibiting an enzyme viral neuraminidase that allows
new virions to leave their infected cells Thus Tamiflu inhibits the spread of virus from infected to uninfected
cells Other antiviral drugs such as Ribavirin have been used to treat a variety of viral infections although its
mechanism of action against certain viruses remains unclear
Figure 2115 Action of an antiviral drug a Tamiflu inhibits a viral enzyme called neuraminidase NA found in the
influenza viral envelope b Neuraminidase cleaves the connection between viral hemagglutinin HA also found in the
viral envelope and glycoproteins on the host cell surface Inhibition of neuraminidase prevents the virus from detaching
from the host cell thereby blocking further infection credit a modification of work by M Eickmann
By far the most successful use of antivirals has been in the treatment of the retrovirus HIV which causes a
disease that if untreated is usually fatal within 10 to 12 years after infection AntiHIV drugs have been able to
control viral replication to the point that individuals receiving these drugs survive for a significantly longer time
than the untreated
AntiHIV drugs inhibit viral replication at many different phases of the HIV replicative cycle Figure 2116 Drugs
have been developed that inhibit the fusion of the HIV viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the host cell
fusion inhibitors the conversion of its RNA genome into doublestranded DNA reverse transcriptase inhibitors
like AZT the integration of the viral DNA into the host genome integrase inhibitors and the processing of viral
proteins protease inhibitors
