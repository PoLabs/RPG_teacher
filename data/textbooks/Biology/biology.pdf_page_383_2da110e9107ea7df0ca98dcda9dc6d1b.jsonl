Chromosome Inversions
A chromosome inversion is the detachment 180 rotation and reinsertion of part of a chromosome Inversions
may occur in nature as a result of mechanical shear or from transposable elements action special DNA
sequences capable of facilitating rearranging chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and
paste DNA sequences Unless they disrupt a gene sequence inversions only change gene orientation and are
likely to have more mild effects than aneuploid errors However altered gene orientation can result in functional
changes because regulators of gene expression could move out of position with respect to their targets causing
aberrant levels of gene products
An inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere or paracentric and occur outside the centromere
Figure 1311 A pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the chromosome
arms relative lengths making these inversions easily identifiable
Figure 1311 Pericentric inversions include the centromere and paracentric inversions do not A pericentric inversion
can change the chromosome arms relative lengths A paracentric inversion cannot
When one homologous chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other does not the individual is an
inversion heterozygote To maintain pointforpoint synapsis during meiosis one homolog must form a loop and
the other homolog must mold around it Although this topology can ensure that the genes correctly align it also
forces the homologs to stretch and can occur with imprecise synapsis regions Figure 1312
Figure 1312 When one chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other does not one chromosome must form an
inverted loop to retain pointforpoint interaction during synapsis This inversion pairing is essential to maintaining gene
alignment during meiosis and to allow for recombination
