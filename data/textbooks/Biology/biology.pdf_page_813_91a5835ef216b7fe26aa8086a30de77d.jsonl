bilaterally symmetrical organism first encounters its environment
Lophotrochozoa are also protostomes in which the blastopore or the point of invagination of the ectoderm
outer germ layer becomes the mouth opening into the alimentary canal This developmental pattern is called
protostomy or first mouth Protostomes include acoelomate pseudocoelomate and eucoelomate phyla The
coelom is a cavity that separates the ectoderm from the endoderm In acoelomates a solid mass of mesoderm
is sandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm and does not form a cavity or coelom leaving little room
for organ development in pseudocoelomates there is a cavity or pseudocoelom that replaces the blastocoel
the cavity within the blastula but it is only lined by mesoderm on the outside of the cavity leaving the gut tube
and organs unlined in eucoelomates the cavity that obliterates the blastocoel as the coelom develops is lined
both on the outside of the cavity parietal layer and also on the inside of the cavity around the gut tube and the
internal organs visceral layer
Eucoelmate protostomes are schizocoels in which mesodermproducing cells typically migrate into the
blastocoel during gastrulation and multiply to form a solid mass of cells Cavities then develop within the cell
mass to form the coelom Since the forming body cavity splits the mesoderm this protostomic coelom is termed a
schizocoelom As we will see later in this chapter chordates the phylum to which we belong generally develop
a coelom by enterocoely pouches of mesoderm pinch off the invaginating primitive gut or archenteron and then
fuse to form a complete coelom We should note here that a eucoelomate can form its true coelom by either
schizocoely or enterocoely The process that produces the coelom is different and of taxonomic importance but
the result is the same a complete mesodermally lined coelom
Most organisms placed in the superphylum Lophotrochozoa possess either a lophophore feeding apparatus
or a trochophore larvae thus the contracted name lophotrochozoa The lophophore is a feeding structure
composed of a set of ciliated tentacles surrounding the mouth A trochophore is a freeswimming larva
characterized by two bands of cilia surrounding a toplike body Some of the phyla classified as Lophotrochozoa
may be missing one or both of these defining structures Nevertheless their placement with the Lophotrochozoa
is upheld when ribosomal RNA and other gene sequences are compared The systematics of this complex group
is still unclear and much more work remains to resolve the cladistic relationships among them
Phylum Platyhelminthes
The flatworms are acoelomate organisms that include many freeliving and parasitic forms The flatworms
possess neither a lophophore nor trochophore larvae although the larvae of one group of flatworms the
Polycladida named after its manybranched digestive tract are considered to be homologous to trochophore
larvae Spiral cleavage is also seen in the polycladids and other basal flatworm groups The developmental
pattern of some of the freeliving forms is obscured by a phenomenon called blastomere anarchy in which
a sort of temporary feeding larva forms followed by a regrouping of cells within the embryo that gives
rise to a secondstage embryo However both the monophyly of the flatworms and their placement in the
Lophotrochozoa has been supported by molecular analyses
The Platyhelminthes consist of two monophyletic lineages the Catenulida and the Rhabditophora The
Catenulida or chain worms is a small clade of just over 100 species These worms typically reproduce
asexually by budding However the offspring do not fully detach from the parents and the formation resembles
a chain in appearance All of the flatworms discussed here are part of the Rhabditophora rhabdite bearers
Rhabdites are rodlike structures discharged in the mucus produced by some freeliving flatworms Eucoelmate
protostomes are schizocoels in which mesodermproducing cells typically migrate into the blastocoel during
gastrulation likely serve in both defense and to provide traction for ciliary gliding along the substrate Unlike
freeliving flatworms many species of trematodes and cestodes are parasitic including important parasites of
humans
