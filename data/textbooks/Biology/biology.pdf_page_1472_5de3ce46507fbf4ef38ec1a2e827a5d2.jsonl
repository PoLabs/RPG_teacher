Figure 464 These are the trophic levels of a food chain in Lake Ontario at the United StatesCanada border Energy
and nutrients flow from photosynthetic green algae at the bottom to the top of the food chain the Chinook salmon
One major factor that limits the length of food chains is energy Energy is lost as heat between each trophic level
due to the second law of thermodynamics Thus after a limited number of trophic energy transfers the amount
of energy remaining in the food chain may not be great enough to support viable populations at yet a higher
trophic level
The loss of energy between trophic levels is illustrated by the pioneering studies of Howard T Odum in the
Silver Springs Florida ecosystem in the 1940s Figure 465 The primary producers generated 20819 kcal
m2yr kilocalories per square meter per year the primary consumers generated 3368 kcalm2yr the secondary
consumers generated 383 kcalm2yr and the tertiary consumers only generated 21 kcalm2yr Thus there is
little energy remaining for another level of consumers in this ecosystem
