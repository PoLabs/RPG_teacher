104  Cancer and the Cell Cycle
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how cancer is caused by uncontrolled cell growth

Understand how protooncogenes are normal cell genes that when mutated become oncogenes

Describe how tumor suppressors function

Explain how mutant tumor suppressors cause cancer
Cancer comprises many different diseases caused by a common mechanism uncontrolled cell growth Despite
the redundancy and overlapping levels of cellcycle control errors do occur One of the critical processes
monitored by the cellcycle checkpoint surveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S
phase Even when all of the cellcycle controls are fully functional a small percentage of replication errors
mutations will be passed on to the daughter cells If changes to the DNA nucleotide sequence occur within a
coding portion of a gene and are not corrected a gene mutation results All cancers start when a gene mutation
gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in cell reproduction
The change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor perhaps a slight delay in the
binding of Cdk to cyclin or an Rb protein that detaches from its target DNA while still phosphorylated Even minor
mistakes however may allow subsequent mistakes to occur more readily Over and over small uncorrected
errors are passed from the parent cell to the daughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more
nonfunctional proteins from uncorrected DNA damage Eventually the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as
the effectiveness of the control and repair mechanisms decreases Uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells
outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area and a tumor oma can result
Protooncogenes
The genes that code for the positive cellcycle regulators are called protooncogenes Protooncogenes are
normal genes that when mutated in certain ways become oncogenesgenes that cause a cell to become
cancerous Consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene In most
instances the alteration of the DNA sequence will result in a less functional or nonfunctional protein The result
is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing the cell cycle however the organism
is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward If a cell cannot reproduce the mutation is
not propagated and the damage is minimal Occasionally however a gene mutation causes a change that
increases the activity of a positive regulator For example a mutation that allows Cdk to be activated without
being partnered with cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are
met If the resulting daughter cells are too damaged to undergo further cell divisions the mutation would not be
propagated and no harm would come to the organism However if the atypical daughter cells are able to undergo
further cell divisions subsequent generations of cells may accumulate even more mutations some possibly in
additional genes that regulate the cell cycle
The Cdk gene in the above example is only one of many genes that are considered protooncogenes In addition
to the cellcycle regulatory proteins any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to
override cellcycle checkpoints An oncogene is any gene that when altered leads to an increase in the rate of
cellcycle progression
Tumor Suppressor Genes
Like protooncogenes many of the negative cellcycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had
become cancerous Tumor suppressor genes are segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins
the type of regulators that when activated can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division The
collective function of the bestunderstood tumor suppressor gene proteins Rb p53 and p21 is to put up a
roadblock to cellcycle progression until certain events are completed A cell that carries a mutated form of a
negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if there is a problem Tumor suppressors are similar to
brakes in a vehicle Malfunctioning brakes can contribute to a car crash
Mutated p53 genes have been identified in more than 50 percent of all human tumor cells This discovery is not
surprising in light of the multiple roles that the p53 protein plays at the G1 checkpoint A cell with a faulty p53 may
