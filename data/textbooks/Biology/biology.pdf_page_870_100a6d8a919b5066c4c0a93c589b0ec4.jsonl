Rays and skates comprise more than 500 species They are closely related to sharks but can be distinguished
from sharks by their flattened bodies pectoral fins that are enlarged and fused to the head and gill slits on their
ventral surface Figure 2915 Like sharks rays and skates have a cartilaginous skeleton Most species are
marine and live on the sea floor with nearly a worldwide distribution
Unlike the stereotypical sharks and rays the Holocephali chimaeras or ratfish have a diphycercal tail equally
sized fin lobes with the tail vertebrae located between them lack scales lost secondarily in evolution and
have teeth modified as grinding plates that are used to feed on mollusks and other invertebrates Figure
2915b Unlike sharks with elasmobranch or naked gills chimaeras have four pairs of gills covered by an
operculum Many species have a pearly iridescence and are extremely pretty

Osteichthyes Bony Fishes
Members of the clade Osteichthyes also called bony fishes are characterized by a bony skeleton The vast
majority of presentday fishes belong to this group which consists of approximately 30000 species making it
the largest class of vertebrates in existence today
Nearly all bony fishes have an ossified skeleton with specialized bone cells osteocytes that produce and
maintain a calcium phosphate matrix This characteristic has been reversed only in a few groups of
Osteichthyes such as sturgeons and paddlefish which have primarily cartilaginous skeletons The skin of bony
fishes is often covered by overlapping scales and glands in the skin secrete mucus that reduces drag when
swimming and aids the fish in osmoregulation Like sharks bony fishes have a lateral line system that detects
vibrations in water
All bony fishes use gills to breathe Water is drawn over gills that are located in chambers covered and ventilated
by a protective muscular flap called the operculum Many bony fishes also have a swim bladder a gasfilled
organ derived as a pouch from the gut The swim bladder helps to control the buoyancy of the fish In most bony
fish the gases of the swim bladder are exchanged directly with the blood The swim bladder is believed to be
homologous to the lungs of lungfish and the lungs of land vertebrates
Bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades Class Actinopterygii rayfinned fishes and Class
Sarcopterygii lobefinned fishes
Actinopterygii Figure 2916a the rayfinned fishes include many familiar fishestuna bass trout and salmon
among othersand represent about half of all vertebrate species Rayfinned fishes are named for the fan of
slender bones that supports their fins
In contrast the fins of Sarcopterygii Figure 2916b are fleshy and lobed supported by bones that are similar
in type and arrangement to the bones in the limbs of early tetrapods The few extant members of this clade
include several species of lungfishes and the less familiar coelacanths which were thought to be extinct until
living specimens were discovered between Africa and Madagascar Currently two species of coelocanths have
been described
