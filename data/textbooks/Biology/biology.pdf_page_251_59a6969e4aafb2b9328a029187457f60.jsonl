Figure 818 The Calvin cycle has three stages In stage 1 the enzyme RuBisCO incorporates carbon dioxide into
an organic molecule 3PGA In stage 2 the organic molecule is reduced using electrons supplied by NADPH In
stage 3 RuBP the molecule that starts the cycle is regenerated so that the cycle can continue Only one carbon
dioxide molecule is incorporated at a time so the cycle must be completed three times to produce a single three
carbon GA3P molecule and six times to produce a sixcarbon glucose molecule
Which of the following statements is true
a
In photosynthesis oxygen carbon dioxide ATP and NADPH are reactants GA3P and water are
products
b
In photosynthesis chlorophyll water and carbon dioxide are reactants GA3P and oxygen are
products
c
In photosynthesis water carbon dioxide ATP and NADPH are reactants RuBP and oxygen are
products
d
In photosynthesis water and carbon dioxide are reactants GA3P and oxygen are products
RuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO2 and RuBP For each CO2 molecule that reacts with one RuBP
two molecules of another compound 3phospho glyceric acid 3PGA form PGA has three carbons and one
phosphate Each turn of the cycle involves only one RuBP and one carbon dioxide and forms two molecules
of 3PGA The number of carbon atoms remains the same as the atoms move to form new bonds during the
reactions 3 C atoms from 3CO2  15 C atoms from 3RuBP  18 C atoms in 6 molecules of 3PGA This process
is called carbon fixation because CO2 is fixed from an inorganic form into organic molecules
Stage 2 Reduction
ATP and NADPH are used to convert the six molecules of 3PGA into six molecules of a chemical called
glyceraldehyde 3phosphate G3P That is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by
3PGA Recall that a reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule Six molecules of both ATP
and NADPH are used For ATP energy is released with the loss of the terminal phosphate atom converting
it into ADP for NADPH both energy and a hydrogen atom are lost converting it into NADP Both of these
molecules return to the nearby lightdependent reactions to be reused and reenergized
Stage 3 Regeneration
Interestingly at this point only one of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle and is sent to the cytoplasm
to contribute to the formation of other compounds needed by the plant Because the G3P exported from the
chloroplast has three carbon atoms it takes three turns of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export
one G3P But each turn makes two G3Ps thus three turns make six G3Ps One is exported while the remaining
five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used to regenerate RuBP which enables the system to prepare
for more CO2 to be fixed Three more molecules of ATP are used in these regeneration reactions
