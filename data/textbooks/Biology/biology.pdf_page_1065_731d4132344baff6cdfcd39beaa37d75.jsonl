Lipids
Lipid digestion begins in the stomach with the aid of lingual lipase and gastric lipase However the bulk of lipid
digestion occurs in the small intestine due to pancreatic lipase When chyme enters the duodenum the hormonal
responses trigger the release of bile which is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder Bile aids in
the digestion of lipids primarily triglycerides by emulsification Emulsification is a process in which large lipid
globules are broken down into several small lipid globules These small globules are more widely distributed
in the chyme rather than forming large aggregates Lipids are hydrophobic substances in the presence of
water they will aggregate to form globules to minimize exposure to water Bile contains bile salts which are
amphipathic meaning they contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts Thus the bile salts hydrophilic side can
interface with water on one side and the hydrophobic side interfaces with lipids on the other By doing so bile
salts emulsify large lipid globules into small lipid globules
Why is emulsification important for digestion of lipids Pancreatic juices contain enzymes called lipases
enzymes that breakdown lipids If the lipid in the chyme aggregates into large globules very little surface area
of the lipids is available for the lipases to act on leaving lipid digestion incomplete By forming an emulsion
bile salts increase the available surface area of the lipids many fold The pancreatic lipases can then act on the
lipids more efficiently and digest them as detailed in Figure 3418 Lipases breakdown the lipids into fatty acids
and glycerides These molecules can pass through the plasma membrane of the cell and enter the epithelial
cells of the intestinal lining The bile salts surround longchain fatty acids and monoglycerides forming tiny
spheres called micelles The micelles move into the brush border of the small intestine absorptive cells where
the longchain fatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse out of the micelles into the absorptive cells leaving the
micelles behind in the chyme The longchain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells
to form triglycerides which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins These large spheres are
called chylomicrons Chylomicrons contain triglycerides cholesterol and other lipids and have proteins on their
surface The surface is also composed of the hydrophilic phosphate heads of phospholipids Together they
enable the chylomicron to move in an aqueous environment without exposing the lipids to water Chylomicrons
leave the absorptive cells via exocytosis Chylomicrons enter the lymphatic vessels and then enter the blood in
the subclavian vein
