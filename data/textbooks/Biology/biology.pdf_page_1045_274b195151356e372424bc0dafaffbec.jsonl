Figure 343b Obligate carnivores are those that rely entirely on animal flesh to obtain their nutrients examples
of obligate carnivores are members of the cat family such as lions and cheetahs Facultative carnivores are
those that also eat nonanimal food in addition to animal food Note that there is no clear line that differentiates
facultative carnivores from omnivores dogs would be considered facultative carnivores
Figure 343 Carnivores like the a lion eat primarily meat The b ladybug is also a carnivore that consumes small
insects called aphids credit a modification of work by Kevin Pluck credit b modification of work by Jon Sullivan
Omnivores are animals that eat both plant and animalderived food In Latin omnivore means to eat
everything Humans bears shown in Figure 344a and chickens are example of vertebrate omnivores
invertebrate omnivores include cockroaches and crayfish shown in Figure 344b

Invertebrate Digestive Systems
Animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they
consume The simplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one
opening for digestion Platyhelminthes flatworms Ctenophora comb jellies and Cnidaria coral jelly fish and
sea anemones use this type of digestion Gastrovascular cavities as shown in Figure 345a are typically a
blind tube or cavity with only one opening the mouth which also serves as an anus Ingested material enters
the mouth and passes through a hollow tubular cavity Cells within the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that
breakdown the food The food particles are engulfed by the cells lining the gastrovascular cavity
The alimentary canal shown in Figure 345b is a more advanced system it consists of one tube with a mouth
at one end and an anus at the other Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal Once
the food is ingested through the mouth it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the
crop then it passes into the gizzard where it is churned and digested From the gizzard the food passes through
the intestine the nutrients are absorbed and the waste is eliminated as feces called castings through the anus
