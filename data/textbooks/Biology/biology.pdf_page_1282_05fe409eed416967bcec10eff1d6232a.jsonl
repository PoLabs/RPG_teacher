KEY TERMS
pain caused by partial blockage of the coronary arteries by the buildup of plaque and lack of oxygen to
the heart muscle
major artery of the body that takes blood away from the heart
small vessel that connects an artery to a capillary bed
blood vessel that takes blood away from the heart
buildup of fatty plaques in the coronary arteries in the heart
oneway membranous flap of connective tissue between the atrium and the ventricle in
the right side of the heart also known as tricuspid valve
plural atria chamber of the heart that receives blood from the veins and sends blood to the ventricles
also mitral valve left atrioventricular valve oneway membranous flap between the atrium and
the ventricle in the left side of the heart
pressure of blood in the arteries that helps to push blood through the body
smallest blood vessel that allows the passage of individual blood cells and the site of diffusion of
oxygen and nutrient exchange
large number of capillaries that converge to take blood to a particular organ or tissue
filling and emptying the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart muscles to
contract and relax
the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute as a product of heart rate multiplied by
stroke volume
specialized heart muscle cell that is striated but contracts involuntarily like smooth muscle
system in which the blood is separated from the bodily interstitial fluid and
contained in blood vessels
vessel that supplies the heart tissue with blood
vessel that takes blood away from the heart tissue back to the chambers in the heart
relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle when the heart is relaxed and the ventricles are filling with blood
flow of blood in two circuits the pulmonary circuit through the lungs and the systemic circuit
through the organs and body
recording of the electrical impulses of the cardiac muscle
innermost layer of tissue in the heart
outermost tissue layer of the heart
circulatory system that is specific to animals with gills for gas exchange the blood flows through
the gills for oxygenation
cavity into which blood is pumped in an open circulatory system
mixture of blood and interstitial fluid that is found in insects and other arthropods as well as most
mollusks
drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs
