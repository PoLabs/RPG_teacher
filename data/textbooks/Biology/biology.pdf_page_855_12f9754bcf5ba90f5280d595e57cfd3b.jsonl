clades of invertebrates Urochordata tunicates salps and larvaceans and Cephalochordata lancelets
together with the vertebrates in the Vertebrata Most tunicates live on the ocean floor and are suspension
feeders Lancelets are suspension feeders that feed on phytoplankton and other microorganisms The sister
taxon of the Chordates is the Ambulacraria which includes both the Echinoderms and the hemichordates
which share pharyngeal slits with the chordates
