Crustaceans typically possess two pairs of antennae mandibles as mouthparts and biramous two branched
appendages which means that their legs are formed in two parts called endopods and exopods which appear
superficially distinct from the uniramous one branched legs of myriapods and hexapods Figure 2842 Since
biramous appendages are also seen in the trilobites biramous appendages represent the ancestral condition in
the arthropods Currently we describe various arthropods as having uniramous or biramous appendages but
these are descriptive only and do not necessarily reflect evolutionary relationships other than that all jointed legs
of arthropods share common ancestry

In most crustaceans the head and thorax is fused to form a cephalothorax Figure 2843 which is covered
by a plate called the carapace thus producing a body plan comprising two tagmata cephalophorax and
abdomen Crustaceans have a chitinous exoskeleton that is shed by molting and ecdysis whenever the animal
requires an increase in size or the next stage of development The exoskeletons of many aquatic species
are also infused with calcium carbonate which makes them even stronger than those of other arthropods
Crustaceans have an open circulatory system where blood is pumped into the hemocoel by the dorsally located
heart Hemocyanin is the major respiratory pigment present in crustaceans but hemoglobin is found in a few
species and both are dissolved in the hemolymph rather than carried in cells
