Figure 475 Percent extinction occurrences as reflected in the fossil record have fluctuated throughout Earths history
Sudden and dramatic losses of biodiversity called mass extinctions have occurred five times
Paleontologists have identified five strata in the fossil record that appear to show sudden and dramatic greater
than half of all extant species disappearing from the fossil record losses in biodiversity These are called mass
extinctions There are many lesser yet still dramatic extinction events but the five mass extinctions have
attracted the most research An argument can be made that the five mass extinctions are only the five most
extreme events in a continuous series of large extinction events throughout the Phanerozoic since 542 million
years ago In most cases the hypothesized causes are still controversial however the most recent mass
extinction event seems clear
The Five Mass Extinctions
The fossil record of the mass extinctions was the basis for defining periods of geological history so they typically
occur at the transition point between geological periods The transition in fossils from one period to another
reflects the dramatic loss of species and the gradual origin of new species These transitions can be seen in the
rock strata Table 472 provides data on the five mass extinctions

Earths history
The OrdovicianSilurian extinction event is the first recorded mass extinction and the second largest During
this period about 85 percent of marine species few species lived outside the oceans became extinct The main
hypothesis for its cause is a period of glaciation and then warming The extinction event actually consists of two
extinction events separated by about 1 million years The first event was caused by cooling and the second
event was due to the subsequent warming The climate changes affected temperatures and sea levels Some
