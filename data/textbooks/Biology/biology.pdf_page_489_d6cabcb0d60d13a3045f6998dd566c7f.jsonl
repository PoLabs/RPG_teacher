Genome Sequence Uses
DNA microarrays are methods that scientists use to detect gene expression by analyzing different DNA
fragments that are fixed to a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and sequences We can discover
almost one million genotypic abnormalities using microarrays whereas wholegenome sequencing can provide
information about all six billion base pairs in the human genome Although studying genome sequencing medical
applications is interesting this discipline dwells on abnormal gene function Knowing about the entire genome
will allow researchers to discover future onset diseases and other genetic disorders early This will allow for
more informed decisions about lifestyle medication and having children Genomics is still in its infancy although
someday it may become routine to use wholegenome sequencing to screen every newborn to detect genetic
abnormalities
In addition to disease and medicine genomics can contribute to developing novel enzymes that convert biomass
to biofuel which results in higher crop and fuel production and lower consumer cost This knowledge should
allow better methods of control over the microbes that industry uses to produce biofuels Genomics could
also improve monitoring methods that measure the impact of pollutants on ecosystems and help clean up
environmental contaminants Genomics has aided in developing agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals that could
benefit medical science and agriculture
It sounds great to have all the knowledge we can get from wholegenome sequencing however humans have a
responsibility to use this knowledge wisely Otherwise it could be easy to misuse the power of such knowledge
leading to discrimination based on a persons genetics human genetic engineering and other ethical concerns
This information could also lead to legal issues regarding health and privacy
174  Applying Genomics
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain pharmacogenomics

Define polygenic
Introducing DNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing projects particularly the Human Genome project
has expanded the applicability of DNA sequence information Many fields such as metagenomics
pharmacogenomics and mitochondrial genomics are using genomics Understanding and finding cures for
diseases is the most common application of genomics
Predicting Disease Risk at the Individual Level
Predicting disease risk involves screening currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual
level Health care professionals can recommend intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs before disease
onset However this approach is most applicable when the problem resides within a single gene defect Such
defects only account for approximately 5 percent of diseases in developed countries Most of the common
diseases such as heart disease are multifactored or polygenic which is a phenotypic characteristic that
involves two or more genes and also involve environmental factors such as diet In April 2010 scientists
at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual Stephen Quake a scientist at
Stanford University who had his genome sequenced The analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various
diseases The medical team performed a risk assessment to analyze Quakes percentage of risk for 55 different
medical conditions The team found a rare genetic mutation which showed him to be at risk for sudden heart
attack The results also predicted that Quake had a 23 percent risk of developing prostate cancer and a 14
