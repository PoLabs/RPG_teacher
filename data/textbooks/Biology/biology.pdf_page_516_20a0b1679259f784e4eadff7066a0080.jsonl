way an allopolyploid can form Notice how it takes two generations or two reproductive acts before the viable
fertile hybrid results
Figure 1816 Alloploidy results when two species mate to produce viable offspring In this example a normal gamete
from one species fuses with a polyploidy gamete from another Two matings are necessary to produce viable offspring
The cultivated forms of wheat cotton and tobacco plants are all allopolyploids Although polyploidy occurs
occasionally in animals it takes place most commonly in plants Animals with any of the types of chromosomal
aberrations that we describe here are unlikely to survive and produce normal offspring Scientists have
discovered more than half of all plant species studied relate back to a species evolved through polyploidy With
such a high rate of polyploidy in plants some scientists hypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as
an adaptation than as an error
Reproductive Isolation
Given enough time the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that
influence reproduction if individuals of the two populations were brought together mating would be less likely
but if mating occurred offspring would be nonviable or infertile Many types of diverging characters may affect
the reproductive isolation the ability to interbreed of the two populations
Reproductive isolation can take place in a variety of ways Scientists organize them into two groups prezygotic
barriers and postzygotic barriers Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg the first cell of an organisms
development that reproduces sexually Therefore a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction
from taking place This includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction A
postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation This includes organisms that dont survive the embryonic
stage and those that are born sterile
Some types of prezygotic barriers prevent reproduction entirely Many organisms only reproduce at certain times
of the year often just annually Differences in breeding schedules which we call temporal isolation can act as
a form of reproductive isolation For example two frog species inhabit the same area but one reproduces from
January to March whereas the other reproduces from March to May Figure 1817
