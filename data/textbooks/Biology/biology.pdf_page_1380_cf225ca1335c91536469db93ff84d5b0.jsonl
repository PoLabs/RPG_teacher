CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
31 Why is sexual reproduction useful if only half the
animals can produce offspring and two separate cells
must be combined to form a third
32 What determines which sex will result in offspring
of birds and mammals
33 What are the advantages and disadvantages of
external and internal forms of fertilization
34 Why would paired external fertilization be
preferable to group spawning
35 Describe the phases of the human sexual
response
36 Compare spermatogenesis and oogenesis as to
timing of the processes and the number and type of
cells finally produced
37 If male reproductive pathways are not cyclical
how are they controlled
38 Describe the events in the ovarian cycle leading
up to ovulation
39 Describe the major developments during each
trimester of human gestation
40 Describe the stages of labor
41 What do you think would happen if multiple
sperm fused with one egg
42 Why do mammalian eggs have a small
concentration of yolk while bird and reptile eggs
have a large concentration of yolk
43 Explain how the different germ layers give rise to
different tissue types
44 Explain the role of axis formation in development
