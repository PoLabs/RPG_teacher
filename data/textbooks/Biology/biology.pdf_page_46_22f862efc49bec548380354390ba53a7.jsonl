21  Atoms Isotopes Ions and Molecules The
Building Blocks
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Define matter and elements

Describe the interrelationship between protons neutrons and electrons

Compare the ways in which electrons can be donated or shared between atoms

Explain the ways in which naturally occurring elements combine to create molecules cells tissues
organ systems and organisms
At its most fundamental level life is made up of matter Matter is any substance that occupies space and
has mass Elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that cannot
break down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions There are 118 elements but only 98 occur
naturally The remaining elements are unstable and require scientists to synthesize them in laboratories
Each element is designated by its chemical symbol which is a single capital letter or when the first letter is
already taken by another element a combination of two letters Some elements follow the English term for the
element such as C for carbon and Ca for calcium Other elements chemical symbols derive from their Latin
names For example the symbol for sodium is Na referring to natrium the Latin word for sodium
The four elements common to all living organisms are oxygen O carbon C hydrogen H and nitrogen N In
the nonliving world elements are found in different proportions and some elements common to living organisms
are relatively rare on the earth as a whole as Table 21 shows For example the atmosphere is rich in nitrogen
and oxygen but contains little carbon and hydrogen while the earths crust although it contains oxygen and a
small amount of hydrogen has little nitrogen and carbon In spite of their differences in abundance all elements
and the chemical reactions between them obey the same chemical and physical laws regardless of whether they
are a part of the living or nonliving world

The Structure of the Atom
To understand how elements come together we must first discuss the elements smallest component or building
block the atom An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the elements chemical properties For
example one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature A gold
coin is simply a very large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and contains small amounts of
other elements known as impurities We cannot break down gold atoms into anything smaller while still retaining
the properties of gold
An atom is composed of two regions the nucleus which is in the atoms center and contains protons and
neutrons The atoms outermost region holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus as Figure 22 illustrates
Atoms contain protons electrons and neutrons among other subatomic particles The only exception is
