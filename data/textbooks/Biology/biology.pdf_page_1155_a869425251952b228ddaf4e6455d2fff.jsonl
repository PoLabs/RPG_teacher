Introduction
An animals endocrine system controls body processes through the production secretion and regulation of
hormones which serve as chemical messengers functioning in cellular and organ activity and ultimately
maintaining the bodys homeostasis The endocrine system plays a role in growth metabolism and sexual
development In humans common endocrine system diseases include thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus In
organisms that undergo metamorphosis the process is controlled by the endocrine system The transformation
from tadpole to frog for example is complex and nuanced to adapt to specific environments and ecological
circumstances
371  Types of Hormones
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

List the different types of hormones

Explain their role in maintaining homeostasis
Maintaining homeostasis within the body requires the coordination of many different systems and organs
Communication between neighboring cells and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body occurs
through the release of chemicals called hormones Hormones are released into body fluids usually blood that
carry these chemicals to their target cells At the target cells which are cells that have a receptor for a signal or
ligand from a signal cell the hormones elicit a response The cells tissues and organs that secrete hormones
make up the endocrine system Examples of glands of the endocrine system include the adrenal glands which
produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses to stress and the thyroid
gland which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates
Although there are many different hormones in the human body they can be divided into three classes based on
their chemical structure lipidderived amino acidderived and peptide peptide and proteins hormones One
