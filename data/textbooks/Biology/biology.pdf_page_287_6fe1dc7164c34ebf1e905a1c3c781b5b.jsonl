15 How does NFB induce gene expression
a
A small hydrophobic ligand binds to NFB
activating it
b
Phosphorylation of the inhibitor IB
dissociates the complex between it and NF
B and allows NFB to enter the nucleus
and stimulate transcription
c
NFB is phosphorylated and is then free to
enter the nucleus and bind DNA
d
NFB is a kinase that phosphorylates a
transcription factor that binds DNA and
promotes protein production
16 Apoptosis can occur in a cell when the cell is
________________
a
damaged
b
no longer needed
c
infected by a virus
d
all of the above
17 What is the effect of an inhibitor binding an
enzyme
a
The enzyme is degraded
b
The enzyme is activated
c
The enzyme is inactivated
d
The complex is transported out of the cell
18 How does PKCs signaling role change in
response to growth factor signaling versus an
immune response
a
PKC interacts directly with signaling
molecules in both cascades but only
exhibits kinase activity during growth factor
signaling
b
PKC interacts directly with signaling
molecules in growth factor cascades but
interacts with signaling inhibitors during
immune signaling
c
PKC amplifies growth factor cascades but
turns off immune cascades
d
PKC is activated during growth factor
cascades but is inactivated during immune
response cascades
19 A scientist notices that a cancer cell line fails to
die when he adds an inducer of apoptosis to his
culture of cells Which hypothesis could explain why
the cells fail to die
a
The cells have a mutation that prevents the
initiation of apoptosis signaling
b
The cells have lost expression of the
receptor for the apoptosisinducing ligand
c
The cells overexpress a growth factor
pathway that inhibits apoptosis
d
All of the above
20 Which type of molecule acts as a signaling
molecule in yeasts
a
steroid
b
autoinducer
c
mating factor
d
second messenger
21 Quorum sensing is triggered to begin when
___________
a
treatment with antibiotics occurs
b
bacteria release growth hormones
c
bacterial protein expression is switched on
d
a sufficient number of bacteria are present
22 A doctor is researching new ways to treat biofilms
on artificial joints Which approach would best help
prevent bacterial colonization of the medical
implants
a
Increase antibiotic dosing
b
Create implants with rougher surfaces
c
Vaccinate patients against all pathogenic
bacteria
d
Inhibit quorum sensing
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
23 What is the difference between intracellular
signaling and intercellular signaling
24 How are the effects of paracrine signaling limited
to an area near the signaling cells
25 What are the differences between internal
receptors and cellsurface receptors
26 Cells grown in the laboratory are mixed with a
dye molecule that is unable to pass through the
plasma membrane If a ligand is added to the cells
observations show that the dye enters the cells What
type of receptor did the ligand bind to on the cell
surface
27 Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar
by binding to its receptor insulin receptor tyrosine
kinase How does insulins behavior differ from
steroid hormone signaling and what can you infer
about its structure
28 The same second messengers are used in many
different cells but the response to second
messengers is different in each cell How is this
possible
29 What would happen if the intracellular domain of
a cellsurface receptor was switched with the domain
from another receptor
