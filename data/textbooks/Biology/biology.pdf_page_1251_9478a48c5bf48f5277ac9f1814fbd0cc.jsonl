394  Transport of Gases in Human Bodily Fluids
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe how oxygen is bound to hemoglobin and transported to body tissues

Explain how carbon dioxide is transported from body tissues to the lungs
Once the oxygen diffuses across the alveoli it enters the bloodstream and is transported to the tissues where
it is unloaded and carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli to be expelled from the body
Although gas exchange is a continuous process the oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported by different
mechanisms
Transport of Oxygen in the Blood
Although oxygen dissolves in blood only a small amount of oxygen is transported this way Only 15 percent of
oxygen in the blood is dissolved directly into the blood itself Most oxygen985 percentis bound to a protein
called hemoglobin and carried to the tissues
Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin or Hb is a protein molecule found in red blood cells erythrocytes made of four subunits
two alpha subunits and two beta subunits Figure 3919 Each subunit surrounds a central heme group
that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen
molecules Molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme groups are brighter red As a result oxygenated
arterial blood where the Hb is carrying four oxygen molecules is bright red while venous blood that is
deoxygenated is darker red
Figure 3919 The protein inside a red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells and carbon dioxide to the lungs is b
hemoglobin Hemoglobin is made up of four symmetrical subunits and four heme groups Iron associated with the
heme binds oxygen It is the iron in hemoglobin that gives blood its red color
It is easier to bind a second and third oxygen molecule to Hb than the first molecule This is because the
