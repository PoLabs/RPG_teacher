a longterm stress response the hypothalamus triggers the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland
The adrenal cortex is stimulated by ACTH to release steroid hormones called corticosteroids Corticosteroids
turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of target cells They change enzyme concentrations in the
cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism There are two main corticosteroids glucocorticoids such as cortisol
and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone These hormones target the breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the
adipose tissue The fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues to use for ATP production
The glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis Glucocorticoids also
have antiinflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system For example cortisone is used as
an antiinflammatory medication however it cannot be used long term as it increases susceptibility to disease
due to its immunesuppressing effects
Mineralocorticoids function to regulate ion and water balance of the body The hormone aldosterone stimulates
the reabsorption of water and sodium ions in the kidney which results in increased blood pressure and volume
Hypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as Cushings disease characterized by a
shifting of fat storage areas of the body This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck
and excessive glucose in the blood Hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause Addisons disease which
may result in bronzing of the skin hypoglycemia and low electrolyte levels in the blood
374  Regulation of Hormone Production
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Explain how hormone production is regulated

Discuss the different stimuli that control hormone levels in the body
Hormone production and release are primarily controlled by negative feedback In negative feedback systems
a stimulus elicits the release of a substance once the substance reaches a certain level it sends a signal that
stops further release of the substance In this way the concentration of hormones in blood is maintained within
a narrow range For example the anterior pituitary signals the thyroid to release thyroid hormones Increasing
levels of these hormones in the blood then give feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit
further signaling to the thyroid gland as illustrated in Figure 3714 There are three mechanisms by which
endocrine glands are stimulated to synthesize and release hormones humoral stimuli hormonal stimuli and
neural stimuli
