332  Animal Primary Tissues
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Describe epithelial tissues

Discuss the different types of connective tissues in animals

Describe three types of muscle tissues

Describe nervous tissue
The tissues of multicellular complex animals are four primary types epithelial connective muscle and nervous
Recall that tissues are groups of similar cells cells carrying out related functions These tissues combine to form
organslike the skin or kidneythat have specific specialized functions within the body Organs are organized
into organ systems to perform functions examples include the circulatory system which consists of the heart
and blood vessels and the digestive system consisting of several organs including the stomach intestines
liver and pancreas Organ systems come together to create an entire organism
Epithelial Tissues
Epithelial tissues cover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a
single layer or multiple layers of cells The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and
the number of layers of cells Epithelia composed of a single layer of cells is called simple epithelia epithelial
tissue composed of multiple layers is called stratified epithelia Table 332 summarizes the different types of
epithelial tissues

Squamous Epithelia
Squamous epithelial cells are generally round flat and have a small centrally located nucleus The cell outline
is slightly irregular and cells fit together to form a covering or lining When the cells are arranged in a single
layer simple epithelia they facilitate diffusion in tissues such as the areas of gas exchange in the lungs and
the exchange of nutrients and waste at blood capillaries
