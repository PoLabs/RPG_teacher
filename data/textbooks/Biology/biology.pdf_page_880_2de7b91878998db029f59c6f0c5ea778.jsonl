Characteristics of Reptiles
Reptiles are tetrapods Limbless reptilessnakes and legless lizardsare classified as tetrapods because they
are descended from fourlimbed ancestors Reptiles lay calcareous or leathery eggs enclosed in shells on land
Even aquatic reptiles return to the land to lay eggs They usually reproduce sexually with internal fertilization
Some species display ovoviviparity with the eggs remaining in the mothers body until they are ready to hatch
In ovoviviparous reptiles most nutrients are supplied by the egg yolk while the chorioallantois assists with
respiration Other species are viviparous with the offspring born alive with their development supported by a
yolk sacplacenta a chorioallantoicplacenta or both
One of the key adaptations that permitted reptiles to live on land was the development of their scaly skin
containing the protein keratin and waxy lipids which reduced water loss from the skin A number of keratinous
epidermal structures have emerged in the descendants of various reptilian lineages and some have become
defining characters for these lineages scales claws nails horns feathers and hair Their occlusive skin means
that reptiles cannot use their skin for respiration like amphibians and thus all amniotes breathe with lungs All
reptiles grow throughout their lives and regularly shed their skin both to accommodate their growth and to rid
themselves of ectoparasites Snakes tend to shed the entire skin at one time but other reptiles shed their skins
in patches
Reptiles ventilate their lungs using various muscular mechanisms to produce negative pressure low pressure
within the lungs that allows them to expand and draw in air In snakes and lizards the muscles of the spine
and ribs are used to expand or contract the rib cage Since walking or running interferes with this activity
the squamates cannot breathe effectively while running Some squamates can supplement rib movement with
buccal pumping through the nose with the mouth closed In crocodilians the lung chamber is expanded and
contracted by moving the liver which is attached to the pelvis Turtles have a special problem with breathing
because their rib cage cannot expand However they can change the pressure around the lungs by pulling their
limbs in and out of the shell and by moving their internal organs Some turtles also have a posterior respiratory
sac that opens off the hindgut that aids in the diffusion of gases
Most reptiles are ectotherms animals whose main source of body heat comes from the environment however
some crocodilians maintain elevated thoracic temperatures and thus appear to be at least regional endotherms
This is in contrast to true endotherms which use heat produced by metabolism and muscle contraction
to regulate body temperature over a very narrow temperature range and thus are properly referred to as
homeotherms Reptiles have behavioral adaptations to help regulate body temperature such as basking in
sunny places to warm up through the absorption of solar radiation or finding shady spots or going underground
to minimize the absorption of solar radiation which allows them to cool down and prevent overheating The
advantage of ectothermy is that metabolic energy from food is not required to heat the body therefore reptiles
can survive on about 10 percent of the calories required by a similarly sized endotherm In cold weather some
reptiles such as the garter snake brumate Brumation is similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less
active and can go for long periods without eating but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not
asleep or living off fat reserves Rather their metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures and the
animal is very sluggish
Evolution of Reptiles
Reptiles originated approximately 300 million years ago during the Carboniferous period One of the oldest
known amniotes is Casineria which had both amphibian and reptilian characteristics One of the earliest
undisputed reptile fossils was Hylonomus a lizardlike animal about 20 cm long Soon after the first amniotes
appeared they diverged into three groupssynapsids anapsids and diapsidsduring the Permian period The
Permian period also saw a second major divergence of diapsid reptiles into stem archosaurs predecessors of
thecodonts crocodilians dinosaurs and birds and lepidosaurs predecessors of snakes and lizards These
groups remained inconspicuous until the Triassic period when the archosaurs became the dominant terrestrial
group possibly due to the extinction of largebodied anapsids and synapsids during the PermianTriassic
extinction About 250 million years ago archosaurs radiated into the pterosaurs and both saurischian lizard hip
and ornithischian birdhip dinosaurs see below
Although they are sometimes mistakenly called dinosaurs the pterosaurs were distinct from true dinosaurs
Figure 2925 Pterosaurs had a number of adaptations that allowed for flight including hollow bones birds
also exhibit hollow bones a case of convergent evolution Their wings were formed by membranes of skin that
attached to the long fourth finger of each arm and extended along the body to the legs
