3 PolyA Tail
Once elongation is complete the premRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus
sequence and a GUrich sequence leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the premRNA An enzyme called polyA
polymerase then adds a string of approximately 200 A residues called the polyA tail This modification further
protects the premRNA from degradation and is also the binding site for a protein necessary for exporting the
processed mRNA to the cytoplasm
PremRNA Splicing
Eukaryotic genes are composed of exons which correspond to proteincoding sequences exon signifies that
they are expressed and intervening sequences called introns intron denotes their intervening role which
may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the premRNA during processing Intron sequences in
mRNA do not encode functional proteins
The discovery of introns came as a surprise to researchers in the 1970s who expected that premRNAs would
specify protein sequences without further processing as they had observed in prokaryotes The genes of higher
eukaryotes very often contain one or more introns These regions may correspond to regulatory sequences
however the biological significance of having many introns or having very long introns in a gene is unclear It is
possible that introns slow down gene expression because it takes longer to transcribe premRNAs with lots of
introns Alternatively introns may be nonfunctional sequence remnants left over from the fusion of ancient genes
throughout the course of evolution This is supported by the fact that separate exons often encode separate
protein subunits or domains For the most part the sequences of introns can be mutated without ultimately
affecting the protein product
All of a premRNAs introns must be completely and precisely removed before protein synthesis If the process
errs by even a single nucleotide the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift and the resulting protein
would be dysfunctional The process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing Figure
1513 Introns are removed and degraded while the premRNA is still in the nucleus Splicing occurs by a
sequencespecific mechanism that ensures introns will be removed and exons rejoined with the accuracy and
precision of a single nucleotide Although the intron itself is noncoding the beginning and end of each intron is
marked with specific nucleotides GU at the 5 end and AG at the 3 end of the intron The splicing of premRNAs
is conducted by complexes of proteins and RNA molecules called spliceosomes
