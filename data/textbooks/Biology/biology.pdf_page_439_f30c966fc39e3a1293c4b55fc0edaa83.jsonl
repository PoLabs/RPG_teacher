from each other they are recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex After many
ribosomes have completed translation the mRNA is degraded so the nucleotides can be reused in another
transcription reaction
Protein Folding Modification and Targeting
During and after translation individual amino acids may be chemically modified signal sequences appended
and the new protein folded into a distinct threedimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions
A signal sequence is a short sequence at the amino end of a protein that directs it to a specific cellular
compartment These sequences can be thought of as the proteins train ticket to its ultimate destination and
are recognized by signalrecognition proteins that act as conductors For instance a specific signal sequence
terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts in plants Once the protein reaches its cellular
destination the signal sequence is usually clipped off
Many proteins fold spontaneously but some proteins require helper molecules called chaperones to prevent
them from aggregating during the complicated process of folding Even if a protein is properly specified by
its corresponding mRNA it could take on a completely dysfunctional shape if abnormal temperature or pH
conditions prevent it from folding correctly
