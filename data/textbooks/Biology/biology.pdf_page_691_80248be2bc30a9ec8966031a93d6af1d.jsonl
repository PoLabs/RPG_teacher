Basidiomycota The Club Fungi
The fungi in the Phylum Basidiomycota are easily recognizable under a light microscope by their club
shaped fruiting bodies called basidia singular basidium which are the swollen terminal cells of hyphae The
basidia which are the reproductive organs of these fungi are often contained within the familiar mushroom
commonly seen in fields after rain on the supermarket shelves and growing on your lawn Figure 2416 These
mushroomproducing basidiomycetes are sometimes referred to as gill fungi because of the presence of gill
like structures on the underside of the cap The gills are actually compacted hyphae on which the basidia are
borne This group also includes shelf fungi which cling to the bark of trees like small shelves In addition the
basidiomycota include smuts and rusts which are important plant pathogens Most edible fungi belong to the
Phylum Basidiomycota however some basidiomycota are inedible and produce deadly toxins For example
Cryptococcus neoformans causes severe respiratory illness The infamous death cap mushroom Amanita
phalloides is related to the fly agaric seen at the beginning of the previous section
