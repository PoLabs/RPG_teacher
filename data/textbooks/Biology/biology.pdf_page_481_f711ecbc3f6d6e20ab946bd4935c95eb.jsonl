advantage over bacterial populations Cultivating and manipulating fungal cells produces antibodies
Scientists used recombinant DNA technology to produce largescale quantities of human insulin in E coli as
early as 1978 Previously it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin which caused allergic reactions
in humans because of differences in the gene product In addition doctors use human growth hormone HGH
to treat growth disorders in children Researchers cloned the HGH gene from a cDNA library and inserted it into
E coli cells by cloning it into a bacterial vector
Transgenic Animals
Although several recombinant proteins in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria some proteins require
a eukaryotic animal host for proper processing For this reason the desired genes are cloned and expressed
in animals such as sheep goats chickens and mice We call animals that have been modified to express
recombinant DNA transgenic animals Several human proteins are expressed in transgenic sheep and goat milk
and some are expressed in chicken eggs Scientists have used mice extensively for expressing and studying
recombinant gene and mutation effects
Transgenic Plants
Manipulating the DNA of plants ie creating GMOs has helped to create desirable traits such as disease
resistance herbicide and pesticide resistance better nutritional value and better shelflife Figure 1710 Plants
are the most important source of food for the human population Farmers developed ways to select for plant
varieties with desirable traits long before modernday biotechnology practices were established

We call plants that have received recombinant DNA from other species transgenic plants Because they are
not natural government agencies closely monitor transgenic plants and other GMOs to ensure that they are fit
for human consumption and do not endanger other plant and animal life Because foreign genes can spread to
other species in the environment extensive testing is required to ensure ecological stability Staples like corn
potatoes and tomatoes were the first crop plants that scientists genetically engineered
Transformation of Plants Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens
Gene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations Many viruses that cause human
diseases such as cancer act by incorporating their DNA into the human genome In plants tumors caused by
