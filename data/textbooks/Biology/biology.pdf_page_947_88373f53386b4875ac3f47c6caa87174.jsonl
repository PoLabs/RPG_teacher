Plants also use the phytochrome system to sense the change of season Photoperiodism is a biological
response to the timing and duration of day and night It controls flowering setting of winter buds and vegetative
growth Detection of seasonal changes is crucial to plant survival Although temperature and light intensity
influence plant growth they are not reliable indicators of season because they may vary from one year to the
next Day length is a better indicator of the time of year
As stated above unfiltered sunlight is rich in red light but deficient in farred light Therefore at dawn all the
phytochrome molecules in a leaf quickly convert to the active Pfr form and remain in that form until sunset In
the dark the Pfr form takes hours to slowly revert back to the Pr form If the night is long as in winter all of
the Pfr form reverts If the night is short as in summer a considerable amount of Pfr may remain at sunrise
By sensing the PrPfr ratio at dawn a plant can determine the length of the daynight cycle In addition leaves
retain that information for several days allowing a comparison between the length of the previous night and
the preceding several nights Shorter nights indicate springtime to the plant when the nights become longer
autumn is approaching This information along with sensing temperature and water availability allows plants
to determine the time of the year and adjust their physiology accordingly Shortday longnight plants use this
information to flower in the late summer and early fall when nights exceed a critical length often eight or fewer
hours Longday shortnight plants flower during the spring when darkness is less than a critical length often
eight to 15 hours Not all plants use the phytochrome system in this way Flowering in dayneutral plants is not
regulated by daylength
Horticulturalist
The word horticulturist comes from the Latin words for garden hortus and culture cultura This career
has been revolutionized by progress made in the understanding of plant responses to environmental stimuli
Growers of crops fruit vegetables and flowers were previously constrained by having to time their sowing
and harvesting according to the season Now horticulturists can manipulate plants to increase leaf flower
or fruit production by understanding how environmental factors affect plant growth and development
Greenhouse management is an essential component of a horticulturists education To lengthen the night
plants are covered with a blackout shade cloth Longday plants are irradiated with red light in winter to
promote early flowering For example fluorescent cool white light high in blue wavelengths encourages
leafy growth and is excellent for starting seedlings Incandescent lamps standard light bulbs are rich in
red light and promote flowering in some plants The timing of fruit ripening can be increased or delayed
by applying plant hormones Recently considerable progress has been made in the development of plant
breeds that are suited to different climates and resistant to pests and transportation damage Both crop
yield and quality have increased as a result of practical applications of the knowledge of plant responses to
external stimuli and hormones
Horticulturists find employment in private and governmental laboratories greenhouses botanical gardens
and in the production or research fields They improve crops by applying their knowledge of genetics and
plant physiology To prepare for a horticulture career students take classes in botany plant physiology plant
pathology landscape design and plant breeding To complement these traditional courses horticulture
majors add studies in economics business computer science and communications
The Blue Light Responses
Phototropismthe directional bending of a plant toward or away from a light sourceis a response to blue
wavelengths of light Positive phototropism is growth towards a light source Figure 3039 while negative
phototropism also called skototropism is growth away from light
The aptlynamed phototropins are proteinbased receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response
Like all plant photoreceptors phototropins consist of a protein portion and a lightabsorbing portion called the
chromophore In phototropins the chromophore is a covalentlybound molecule of flavin hence phototropins
belong to a class of proteins called flavoproteins
Other responses under the control of phototropins are leaf opening and closing chloroplast movement and the
opening of stomata However of all responses controlled by phototropins phototropism has been studied the
longest and is the best understood
