which transports sugars and proteins With the development of the vascular system leaves appeared to act as
large photosynthetic organs and roots to access water from the ground Small uncomplicated leaves are
termed microphylls Large leaves with vein patterns are termed megaphylls Modified leaves that bear
sporangia are called sporophylls Some sporophylls are arranged in cone structures called strobili
The support and conductive properties of vascular tissues have allowed the sporophyte generation of vascular
plants to become increasingly dominant The seedless vascular plants include club mosses which are the most
primitive whisk ferns which lost leaves and roots by reductive evolution and horsetails and ferns Ferns are
the most advanced group of seedless vascular plants They are distinguished by large leaves called fronds and
small sporangiacontaining structures called sori which are found on the underside of the fronds
Both mosses and ferns play an essential role in the balance of the ecosystems Mosses are pioneering species
that colonize bare or devastated environments and make it possible for succession to occur They contribute to
the enrichment of the soil and provide shelter and nutrients for animals in hostile environments Mosses are
important biological indicators of environmental pollution Ferns are important for providing natural habitats as
soil stabilizers and as decorative plants Both mosses and ferns are part of traditional medical practice In
addition to culinary medical and decorative purposes mosses and ferns can be used as fuels and ancient
seedless plants were important contributors to the fossil fuel deposits that we now use as an energy resource
