Genomic DNA
Before discussing the steps a cell must undertake to replicate and divide its DNA a deeper understanding of the
structure and function of a cells genetic information is necessary A cells DNA packaged as a doublestranded
DNA molecule is called its genome In prokaryotes the genome is composed of a single doublestranded DNA
molecule in the form of a loop or circle Figure 102 The region in the cell containing this genetic material is
called a nucleoid Some prokaryotes also have smaller loops of DNA called plasmids that are not essential for
normal growth Bacteria can exchange these plasmids with other bacteria sometimes receiving beneficial new
genes that the recipient can add to their chromosomal DNA Antibiotic resistance is one trait that often spreads
through a bacterial colony through plasmid exchange from resistant donors to recipient cells
Figure 102 Prokaryotes including both Bacteria and Archaea have a single circular chromosome located in a central
region called the nucleoid
In eukaryotes the genome consists of several doublestranded linear DNA molecules Figure 103 Each
species of eukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells Human body
somatic cells have 46 chromosomes while human gametes sperm or eggs have 23 chromosomes each
A typical body cell contains two matched or homologous sets of chromosomes one set from each biological
parenta configuration known as diploid Note The letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes
therefore a diploid organism is designated 2n Human cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called
gametes or sex cells these are eggs and sperm and are designated 1n or haploid
Upon fertilization each gamete contributes one set of chromosomes creating a diploid cell containing matched
pairs of chromosomes called homologous same knowledge chromosomes Homologous chromosomes are
the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location or locus
Genes the functional units of chromosomes determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins
Traits are the variations of those characteristics For example hair color is a characteristic with traits that are
blonde brown or black and many colors in between
