the geographic distribution and phenology of plants and animals  Phenology is the study of the effects of
climatic conditions on the timing of periodic life cycle events such as flowering in plants or migration in birds
Researchers have shown that 385 plant species in Great Britain are flowering 45 days sooner than was
recorded earlier during the previous 40 years In addition insectpollinated species were more likely to flower
earlier than windpollinated species The impact of changes in flowering date would be mitigated if the insect
pollinators emerged earlier This mismatched timing of plants and pollinators could result in injurious ecosystem
effects because for continued survival insectpollinated plants must flower when their pollinators are present
