Set Point
It is possible to adjust a systems set point When this happens the feedback loop works to maintain the new
setting An example of this is blood pressure over time the normal or set point for blood pressure can increase
as a result of continued increases in blood pressure The body no longer recognizes the elevation as abnormal
and no attempt is made to return to the lower set point The result is the maintenance of an elevated blood
pressure that can have harmful effects on the body Medication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point
in the system to a more healthy level This is called a process of alteration of the set point in a feedback loop
Changes can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system This
is called acclimatization This occurs for instance when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than that to
which it is accustomed In order to adjust to the lower oxygen levels at the new altitude the body increases the
number of red blood cells circulating in the blood to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues Another
example of acclimatization is animals that have seasonal changes in their coats a heavier coat in the winter
ensures adequate heat retention and a light coat in summer assists in keeping body temperature from rising to
harmful levels
Feedback mechanisms can be understood in terms of driving a race car along a track watch a short video

Homeostasis Thermoregulation
Body temperature affects body activities Generally as body temperature rises enzyme activity rises as well For
every ten degree centigrade rise in temperature enzyme activity doubles up to a point Body proteins including
enzymes begin to denature and lose their function with high heat around 50oC for mammals Enzyme activity
will decrease by half for every ten degree centigrade drop in temperature to the point of freezing with a few
exceptions Some fish can withstand freezing solid and return to normal with thawing

Endotherms and Ectotherms
Animals can be divided into two groups some maintain a constant body temperature in the face of differing
environmental temperatures while others have a body temperature that is the same as their environment and
thus varies with the environment Animals that do not control their body temperature are ectotherms This group
has been called coldblooded but the term may not apply to an animal in the desert with a very warm body
temperature In contrast to ectotherms which rely on external temperatures to set their body temperatures
poikilotherms are animals with constantly varying internal temperatures An animal that maintains a constant
body temperature in the face of environmental changes is called a homeotherm Endotherms are animals that
rely on internal sources for body temperature but which can exhibit extremes in temperature These animals are
able to maintain a level of activity at cooler temperature which an ectotherm cannot due to differing enzyme
levels of activity
