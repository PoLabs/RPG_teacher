hemoglobin molecule changes its shape or conformation as oxygen binds The fourth oxygen is then more
difficult to bind The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of
oxygen in the blood xaxis versus the relative Hboxygen saturation yaxis The resulting graphan oxygen
dissociation curveis sigmoidal or Sshaped Figure 3920 As the partial pressure of oxygen increases the
hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen
Figure 3920 The oxygen dissociation curve demonstrates that as the partial pressure of oxygen increases
more oxygen binds hemoglobin However the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen may shift to the left or the right
depending on environmental conditions
The kidneys are responsible for removing excess H ions from the blood If the kidneys fail what would
happen to blood pH and to hemoglobin affinity for oxygen
Factors That Affect Oxygen Binding
The oxygencarrying capacity of hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood In addition
to PO2  other environmental factors and diseases can affect oxygen carrying capacity and delivery
Carbon dioxide levels blood pH and body temperature affect oxygencarrying capacity Figure 3920 When
carbon dioxide is in the blood it reacts with water to form bicarbonate HCO3
 and hydrogen ions H As
the level of carbon dioxide in the blood increases more H is produced and the pH decreases This increase
in carbon dioxide and subsequent decrease in pH reduce the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen The oxygen
dissociates from the Hb molecule shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the right Therefore more oxygen is
needed to reach the same hemoglobin saturation level as when the pH was higher A similar shift in the curve
also results from an increase in body temperature Increased temperature such as from increased activity of
skeletal muscle causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced
Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the bloods ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its
oxygencarrying capacity In sickle cell anemia the shape of the red blood cell is crescentshaped elongated
and stiffened reducing its ability to deliver oxygen Figure 3921 In this form red blood cells cannot pass
through the capillaries This is painful when it occurs Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect
in either the alpha or the beta subunit of Hb Patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood
cells but these cells have lowerthannormal levels of hemoglobin Therefore the oxygencarrying capacity is
diminished
