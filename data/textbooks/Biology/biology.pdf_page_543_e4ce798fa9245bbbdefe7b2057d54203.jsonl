KEY TERMS
increase in frequency of beneficial alleles and decrease in deleterious alleles due to
selection
also gene frequency rate at which a specific allele appears within a population
when individuals tend to mate with those who are phenotypically similar to themselves
magnification of genetic drift as a result of natural events or catastrophes
gradual geographic variation across an ecological gradient
selection that favors phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation
selection that favors two or more distinct phenotypes
also Darwinian fitness individuals ability to survive and reproduce
event that initiates an allele frequency change in part of the population which is not typical of the
original population
selection that favors phenotypes that are either common positive frequency
dependent selection or rare negative frequencydependent selection
flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the individual or gamete migration
all the alleles that the individuals in the population carry
effect of chance on a populations gene pool
distribution of the different possible genotypes in a population
diversity of alleles and genotypes in a population
differences in the phenotypic variation between populations that are separated
geographically
theory of sexual selection that argues individuals develop impressive ornaments to
show off their efficient metabolism or ability to fight disease
theory of sexual selection that argues only the fittest individuals can afford costly traits
fraction of population variation that can be attributed to its genetic variance
trait that gives a truthful impression of an individuals fitness
mating of closely related individuals
increase in abnormalities and disease in inbreeding populations
broader scale evolutionary changes that scientists see over paleontological time
changes in a populations genetic structure
overarching evolutionary paradigm that took shape by the 1940s and scientists generally
accept today
changes in a populations gene pool due to mate choice or other forces that cause
individuals to mate with certain phenotypes more than others
study of how selective forces change the allele frequencies in a population over time
