KEY TERMS
3 untranslated region region just downstream of the proteincoding region in an RNA molecule that is
not translated
a methylated guanosine triphosphate GTP molecule that is attached to the 5 end of a messenger RNA
to protect the end from degradation
5 untranslated region region just upstream of the proteincoding region in an RNA molecule that is not
translated
protein that binds to prokaryotic operators to increase transcription
protein that complexes with cAMP to bind to the promoter sequences of
operons which control sugar processing when glucose is not available
transcription factor binding sites within the promoter that regulate the transcription of a gene
adjacent to it
enzyme that chops the premiRNA into the mature form of the miRNA
epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing a process involving adding a methyl
group to the DNA molecule
segment of DNA that is upstream downstream perhaps thousands of nucleotides away or on
another chromosome that influence the transcription of a specific gene
heritable changes that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence
protein that binds first to an mRNA to initiate translation
processes that control the turning on or turning off of a gene
molecule that is left after the energy is used to start translation
energyproviding molecule that binds to eIF2 and is needed for translation
epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing a process involving adding or
removing an acetyl functional group
operon that can be activated or repressed depending on cellular needs and the surrounding
environment
protein complex containing eIF2 that starts translation
operon in prokaryotic cells that encodes genes required for processing and intake of lactose
second larger ribosomal subunit that binds to the RNA to translate it into protein
small RNA molecules approximately 21 nucleotides in length that bind to RNA molecules
to degrade them
oncogene that causes cancer in many cancer cells
protein that prevents transcription
region of DNA outside of the promoter region that binds activators or repressors that control gene
expression in prokaryotic cells
collection of genes involved in a pathway that are transcribed together as a single mRNA in prokaryotic
cells
a series of adenine nucleotides that are attached to the 3 end of an mRNA to protect the end from
