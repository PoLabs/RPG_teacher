304  Leaves
By the end of this section you will be able to do the following

Identify the parts of a typical leaf

Describe the internal structure and function of a leaf

Compare and contrast simple leaves and compound leaves

List and describe examples of modified leaves
Leaves are the main sites for photosynthesis the process by which plants synthesize food Most leaves are
usually green due to the presence of chlorophyll in the leaf cells However some leaves may have different
colors caused by other plant pigments that mask the green chlorophyll
The thickness shape and size of leaves are adapted to the environment Each variation helps a plant species
maximize its chances of survival in a particular habitat Usually the leaves of plants growing in tropical
rainforests have larger surface areas than those of plants growing in deserts or very cold conditions which are
likely to have a smaller surface area to minimize water loss
Structure of a Typical Leaf
Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina which is also the widest part of the leaf Some leaves are
attached to the plant stem by a petiole Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant
stem are called sessile leaves Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as
stipules Most leaves have a midrib which travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce
veins of vascular tissue The edge of the leaf is called the margin Figure 3021 shows the structure of a typical
eudicot leaf
