Figure 165 The Marketing Charts email template responds to the screen size  
of the device on which it is viewed 
To ensure optimal rendering on mobile devices 
here are some common best practices to follow 
when designing your emails
	
Generally most emails are designed to be 
600px wide to display well in an email preview pane This scales well on typical mobile 
screen sizes On a 320px screen an email can be zoomed out to 50 and display perfectly 
similarly on a 480px screen it can display at 75
	
Host your email newsletters online and link to them from your preheader That way anyone 
who opens your email on a mobile can click straight through to an HTML version of your 
newsletter 
	
Design your email in a grid system This means your content needs to be laid out in vertically 
and horizontally aligned blocks with gaps in between Doing this will make it easier for 
various operating systems and email clients to scale your email down to fit a mobile screen 
This is not a guarantee that the email will display properly in mobile but it should solve the 
problem for most mobile devices such as iPhone which autofit HTML emails 
	
Make sure that you include alt text for your images Your email needs to convey its message 
with or without images 
	
Mobile devices that dont automatically scale your email down will display the content 
on the left of your email first Make sure that your most important content is placed here 
	
Button links need to be at least 44px to render well on mobile phones Smashing Magazine 
recommends 72px so that users can easily tap buttons with their thumbs and see visual 
feedback that the button has been pushed
Dont worry if some of this sounds a bit 
too technical Your web developer will 
understand and be able to advise you
