151 INTRODUCTION
Customer relationship management CRM has existed since people first started selling things 
The first shopkeeper who stopped to chat with their customers who knew them by name and 
perhaps gave them a small freebie for continually using their services was practicing a form 
of customer relationship marketing by making customers feel special They were also probably 
seeing the favourable impact on their bottom line It helped that customers were being served 
directly by the business owner This meant it was easy for a shopkeeper to grow their brand 
perception and value through direct interaction with customers
Today with businesses becoming more digitally remote and with persontoperson contact 
becoming sporadic CRM is more important than ever We need to build and maintain relation
ships with our customers A faceless company is not personable or engaging and therefore has 
to work harder to fill the gap between attracting and retaining customers and their goodwill 
The relationship a customer builds with a company andor brand is often the reason they return 
Building those relationships today is more difficult than ever Customers are smart and exercise 
their right to choose and a competitor can be just a click away Users expect companies to 
engage with them interact and share meaningful content
CRM is a customerfocused approach to business based on fostering longtermmeaningful 
relationships CRM is not about immediate profit Its about the lifetime value of a customer their 
future purchases the positive word of mouth they will generate on your behalf and the loyalty 
they will show your brand Effective CRM enables businesses to collaborate with customers 
to inform overall business strategies drive business processes support brand development 
and maximise ROI 
There are two approaches to CRM Businesses can apply it either as an approach to communi
cation strategy using personalised and segmented contact or as a core business strategy such 
as loyalty programmes The size and goals of your business determine which one you choose 
There is a truism that a happy customer tells one person but an unhappy customer tells ten 
With your customers voices being heard on blogs forums review sites and social media they 
can talk loudly and impact your business easily
