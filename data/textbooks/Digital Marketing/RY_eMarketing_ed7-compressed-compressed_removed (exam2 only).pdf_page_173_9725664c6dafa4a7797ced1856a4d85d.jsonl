UNITING
equally frustrating for an organisation not to know who has spoken previously with a customer 
and what was dealt with This could be a touchpoint at which a company falls down and leaves 
a less than positive impression with the customer 
Fortunately there are many technological options that help to record all this information in 
one place Most of these services can also schedule elements of the sales process and set 
reminders where appropriate for followup action 
Some notable examples include Salesforce 
salesforcecom and Geniusgeniuscom 
Bespoke technology tailored to business 
problems can have remarkable results 
1554 Keeping data fresh 
Call it what you will but stale outdated or unhealthy data doesnt benefit anyone Some 
generic older data can help you assess trends over time but identifiable customer data is 
usually redundant if not up to date People move houseupdate their contact numbers and 
email addresses and change jobs They earn more or less stop working start working have 
kids and retire All of these mean that their needs change and their contactability changes 
therefore maintaining a customer relationship and delivering relevant communication becomes 
impossible if your information is not fresh 
So how do you keep your data fresh 
For generic data like web analytics you must continuously monitor trends and note what 
causes changes over time This is also useful for monitoring trends and identifying gaps in 
data when a business evolves For instance if you know that you generally receive increased 
website and store visits during December but your sales drop you know that you need to 
gather more data around your inventory and instore environment during that time 
Keeping identifiable data current means you need to facilitate regular dialogue with contacts 
on your database Whether its through a call centre an online prompt or a quick question at 
your instore point of sale there needs to be a plan for updating details at regular intervals 
You can empower your customers and incentivise them with programme attractiveness 
1555 Analysing data for marketing 
One of the most powerful features of interactions and transactions over the internet is that 
everything is tracked and recorded see Chapter 20 Tracking and analysis and Chapter21 
Conversion optimisation This provides a wealth of data that can be analysed to make 
business decisions 
For CRM this means that the customer acquisition source can be recorded and analysed 
against sales data This leads to a very accurate return on investmentROI calculation and 
indicates where CRM and marketing efforts should be focused 
Consider user adoption rates and the 
cost of time and integration when 
making a decision about which CRM 
software to use
