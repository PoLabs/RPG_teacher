you can use for each email you sendyou 
just need to slot content into the appropriate 
sections Some email service providers offer 
readymade templates for you to use As with website templatespaidfor email templates 
come with some benefits and disadvantages While they are often cheaper than commissioning 
a custom template they can be inflexible and generic meaning that they will not uniquely 
represent your brand If you are choosing a template to buy consider picking the plainest one 
so that you can adapt it to your brand as needed

ensure it displays well across many email readers and devices

challenging as some users still use preview panes to read their email
