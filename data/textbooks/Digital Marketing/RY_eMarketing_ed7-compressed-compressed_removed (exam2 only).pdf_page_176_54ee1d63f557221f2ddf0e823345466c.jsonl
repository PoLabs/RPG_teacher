Customer relationship managementCRM
When they purchase from you again these costs can be measured against the repeat 
sales likely to be made over the course of the customers lifetime 
For example most customers will purchase 
a new smartphone every 2 to 3 years 
the new phones will be the latest or most 
current model In between that they may 
purchase accessories such as phone 
cases spare chargers or earphones Each of these opportunities allow a company to 
calculate a lifetime value and ensure that their spending on a particular customer is justified 
156 THE BENEFITS OF CRM
At its core effective CRM promises the following 
	
Increased revenue and profitability 
	
Improved customer satisfaction and loyalty 
	
Better service delivery and operational efficiencies 
	
Decreased acquisition costs keeping churn low through CRM offsets the need to spend 
as much on the acquisition of new clients while retention of existing customers is cheaper 
for obvious reasons 
Maintaining good customer relationships is 
critical to the success of a business The cost 
associated with acquiring a new customer is 
generally far higher than the cost of maintain
ing an existing customer relationship While an 
investment in a CRM communication programme or platform can be large these costs are 
often offset by the increased revenue generated by encouraging repeat business
