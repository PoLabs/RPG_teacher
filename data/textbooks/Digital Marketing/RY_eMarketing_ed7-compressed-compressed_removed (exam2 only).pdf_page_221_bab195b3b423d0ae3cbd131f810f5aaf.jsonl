ISPs thresholds a senders messages will be delivered If not the senders emails may arrive 
in the bulk or spam folder be quarantined or be bounced back to the sender 
How it works There are various authentication systems that can impact your reputation 
score One of these is the Domain Keys Identified Mail DKIM and Domain Name System 
DNS DKIM associates domain names with individual email addresses ensuring that 
each organisation has to take responsibility for emails sent that are associated with their 
domain Basically DKIM signs out any outbound emails 
The DKIM signature is added to the email header and includes an encrypted code The 
receiving mail server will then take that DKIM signature and verify it with the DNS system 
to find the matching DKIM public key Once it has this key it can use it to unlock the 
encrypted code If the code hasnt been changed the email hasnt been tampered with 
which means it can be authenticated and passed into the receiving mail server 
Becoming an effective email marketer requires constant list cleansing and hygiene In fact 
most lists shrink by about 22 each year as a result of subscribers changing email addresses 
HubSpot nd Build a preference centre and send out an email once a year asking subscribers 
to update their details Make sure you are diligent about maintaining a current optin list to 
achieve maximum deliverability via reputation

ISPs offer various authentication standards such as Sender ID sender policy framework 
SPF and DomainKeys We highly recommend the use of these standards 
	
Remember that a huge but inaccurate and outdated database is far less useful to an email 
marketer than a tightly maintained smaller database Strive to boost your database but 
dont forget to clean as you go 
	
Ensure that email broadcast rates are not too high 
	
Respond to complaints and unsubscribe requests If someone requests to be unsubscribed 
do so If you dont theres a good chance youll face stiff penalties
