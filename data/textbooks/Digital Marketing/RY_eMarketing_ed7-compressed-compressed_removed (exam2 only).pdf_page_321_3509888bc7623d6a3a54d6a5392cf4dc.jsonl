ANALYSING
The homepage had to highlight all of the right features in order for potential customers 
to sign up The web design and marketing team knew that this approach would result in 
more conversions visitortotrial and trialtopaid
However changing the homepage was a risk The homepage draws the most visits and 
launching the test could result in lost conversions and a decline in traffic The conversion 
rate also had to be worth the effort In other words a nominal increase in conversions 
would not necessarily justify the work the team put into the new design 
Figure 2111 The original homepage for Hubstaff
The solution 
Hubstaff settled on doing a split test This meant that 50 of traffic was directed to their 
original homepage Figure 2111 and the other 50 to the new homepage
They used VWO software to track the following metrics
	
Visitortotrial conversion
	
Hero form submission This tracked the number of visitors who used the hero form 
seen in Figure 219 as opposed to clicking a Free 14day trial call to action button
	
Onpage engagement This tracked visitor engagement with the homepage by tracking 
clicks
	
Pricing page views
Further the full visitor journey was tracked to understand whether the conversion from 
trial to paid was due to the new homepage design or the experience using the app
