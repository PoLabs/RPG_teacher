CRM loyalty programs 
There is a difference between CRM and loyalty programmes Loyalty programmes actively 
seek to maintain customers by rewarding them with a hard currency like points Loyalty 
programmes are designed to develop and maintain customer relationships over a sustained 
period of time by rewarding them for every interaction with the brand You may for instance 
earn points on a purchase for shopping on certain days completing a survey or choosing to 
receive a statement by email 
Consider South African health insurer Discovery and their Vitality program It aims to keep 
customers healthy by rewarding them for healthrelated behaviours like exercisinghaving 
regular checkups stopping smoking and buying healthy foods By doing soit reduces the 
burden of illhealth on the medical aid itself
