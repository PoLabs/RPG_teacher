Enter the metaverse
The opportunities that this opens up for marketing and brands is best illustrated in the adidas 
merch window where their new collection was a mix of digital and physical items sold as 
NFTs Customers were able to buy virtual wearables to be used in among others The Sandbox 
but also the physical clothing such as hoodies and tracksuits to match adidascom

In another example Gucci who wanted to 
raise awareness of their brand among young 
customers partnered with the platform Roblox 
In 2021 Gucci created the Gucci Garden a 
virtual popup art installation where visitors 
could view try on and buy digital Gucci 
products to glam up their own blank avatars 
before exploring the garden 
Some aspects of the metaverse are also already evident in virtual video game worlds A 
socialisation tool like Gathertown brings together multiple elements of our lives into online 
worlds These apps are not the metaverse but are similar 
The multiverse explained 
Multiverse literally means multiple universes Based on the theory of a many worlds inter
pretation MWI the multiverse is a concept of a pretime era before the Big Bang where 
multiple universes existed and ours was only one of many independent others This science 
of quantum mechanics claims that time is like the branches of a tree where all possibilities 
play out to every eventuality in an infinite number of parallel universes rather than only one 
straight or linear timeline that we understand in our universe This theory however cannot be 
verified by scientific testing
If we however think of it as a virtual multiverse it already exists in various online ecosystems 
In online gaming Fortnite Roblox and Minecraft are examples of virtual multiverses while 
in business Microsoft Mesh  a collaboration and communications platform developed by 
Microsoft  may be an example of another Universes in the multiverse operate independently 
of each other and do not offer a unified experience from one to the other
The primary difference between multiverse and the metaverse is that each universe in the 
multiverse is separate whereas the metaverse is believed to encompass all universes in 
one ecosystem  seamlessly unifying the experience from one universe to the next The 
metaverse is not a piece of scifi tech but  an intricate web of slowly developing pieces
