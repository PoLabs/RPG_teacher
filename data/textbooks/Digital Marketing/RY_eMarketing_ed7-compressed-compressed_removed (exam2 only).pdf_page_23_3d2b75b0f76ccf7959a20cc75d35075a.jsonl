CLAIMING
Flexible grid
Typical websites are designed as large centred fixedwidth blocks With responsive design 
the page elements such as the heading the text or copy the main image and other blocks 
of information are arranged in a grid of columns that have predefined spacing Each element 
relates proportionally to the other elements This allows elements to rearrange or resize in 
relation to each other whether the screen is tiny or huge and the screen quality is high or low 
Although this system allows for flexibility an extremely narrow screen can cause the design 
to break down In this case we can make use of media queries
Figure 79 Flexible grid used in responsive design
Media queries
Media queries are bits of code that allow websites to ask devices for information about 
themselves The website style that will suit the device best is then selected from a list of styles 
defined in a CSS Media queries ask for information about the devices browser window size 
orientation landscape or portrait and screen display quality 
Flexible images
Images are designed to move and scale with 
the flexible grid An important consideration 
is how fast the website loads Highquality 
images are therefore made available for larger 
screens and lowerresolution images are made 
available for smaller screens Parts of images 
can also be displayed for smaller screens to 
maintain image quality Images can even be hidden completely Image optimisation is done 
in CSS which queries the screen height width and pixel ratio of the device and then adjusts 
the images accordingly MDN 2016
