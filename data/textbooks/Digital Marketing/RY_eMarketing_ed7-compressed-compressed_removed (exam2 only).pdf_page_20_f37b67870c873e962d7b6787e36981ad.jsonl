Web development and design 
A responsive website is not the same as an adaptive website A responsive site uses the 
browsers screen space to determine how to reflow the original design content that was 
probably optimised for desktop while an adaptive site provides a specifically tailored design 
for the device you are using Designing an adaptive site requires multiple fixed layout sizes 
usually the six most common screen widths The relevant one is deployed depending on the 
screen size of the device 
Many users prefer responsive design as it provides familiarity uniformity and seamlessness which 
are important considerations in user experience Soegaard 2021 Responsive design should 
be mobile friendly This helps to maintain usability when reflowed for a mobile devices screen 
Adaptive designs are more labour intensive and more expensive As an approach its being 
used less and less Although industry professionals often prefer adaptive sites industry 
preference wont translate into higher listings on SERPs while Googles ranking methodology 
favours responsive design

need to build one website for the full range of 
devices from desktop to mobile This can be a 
technically challenging exercise and will require 
a lot of planning upfront to make sure that the 
site displays correctly on each device
