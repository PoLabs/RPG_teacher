Personalised greeting 
With a database that has the capability to store readers names it is possible to personalise 
the greeting of the email Hi Kim Morgan can elicit far better responses than Dear Valued 
Customer but it is possible to create a greeting with personality without personalising it 
Occasionally the subject line can be personalised as well to boost responses Including your 
subscribers name is not the only way to make your subject lines more personal You can also 
use casual language share something or use copy that implies familiar tone or friendship

Body 
This is where the content of the email goes Dont be tempted to use too many images they 
can increase the size of the email and obscure text when images do not load Be sure that text 
can be read without an image being loaded The structure must allow readers to scan and 
navigate the email easily Short paragraphs emphasis through bolding and colours as well 
as sectioning information with bullets and borders all contribute to a wellstructured email 
Footer 
A standard footer for emails helps to build consistency It is the customary place for the contact 
details of the company sending the email It should include the name physical address and 
contact email of the company It can also include the privacy policy of the sender or even extra 
copy to reinforce branding One way to grow the email list is to add a forward to a friend link 
in the footer or more commonly social media buttons The most important part of the footer 
is a clear unsubscribe link
