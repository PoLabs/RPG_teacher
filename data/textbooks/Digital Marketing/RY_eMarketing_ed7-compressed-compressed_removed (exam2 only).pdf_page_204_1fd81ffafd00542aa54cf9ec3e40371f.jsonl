1634 Email on mobile 
You now know that most email is opened first on a mobile device in fact about 3 to 5 consumers 
say they check their email on the go mobile and 75 say they use their smartphones most 
often to check email Van Rijn 2022ial Users expect an engaging attractive experience across 
devices so an email that isnt formatted for a mobile device isnt going to get a good response 
Many users will simply delete the email or even opt out rather than opening it again on desktop
This presents a challenge for email design The mobile screen is obviously much smaller than 
a desktop screen so the way an email is displayed differs as well Not only thatbut different 
mobile devices have different screen sizes and they make use of different mobile operating 
systems This means that each one has different standards and default settings and renders 
emails in a unique way 
To make things even more difficult very few 
users view an email on only one device They 
may switch from their smartphone to their 
laptop to their tablet and back to their mobile 
phone during the course of a day Although sending two versions of your email is an option 
one for mobile one for desktopits probably not the best solution You want an email that 
displays well across as many different clients and operating systems as possible One way to 
achieve this is through responsive email design 
Some smartphones do render HTML emails and can autofit them for mobile screens but this 
can still affect the way the email displays 
The most important things to keep in mind 
when designing an email for mobile are 
	
The screen is a lot smaller
	
Inputs can vary with touchscreens being 
the most common
Take into account that 62 of mobile users will delete an email if it is not mobileoptimised 
In a study it was found that 52 of users said that a bad mobile experience made them less 
likely to engage with a company Rinaldi 2022 Your content must be easy to skim with clear 
calls to action
