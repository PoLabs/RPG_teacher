Customer relationship managementCRM
example Pick n Pay a large grocery store chain in South Africa drastically cut the rewards 
on its Smart Shopper loyalty programme in early 2017 Customers went from earning R1 for 
each R100 spent to earning R1 for each R200 spent The initially generous loyalty program 
and associated loyalty currency was impacting on the business bottom line Such a radical 
change in reward levels did not go down well with customers and the brand did experience 
some fall out The impact of the programme on the business operational costs should have 
been assessed and addressed earlier rather than so many years after implementation leaving 
customers with a negative experience of the brand Business Day 2017 
Where loyalty programmes are built around straightforward points and rewards systems they 
can also become a point of parity A loyalty programme should deliver on value that is unique 
and central to your organisation You dont want to be competing with your competitor on 
who can provide more points which essentially means more discounts and ends up being a 
competition based on price The sum of the parts of your loyalty programme should be difficult 
for a competitor to replicate 
Cryptocurrencies
Like loyalty currencies cryptocurrencies are also based in the digital world and not tied to 
a central banking authority Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were developed as a means of 
facilitating electronic payments online using a peertopeer network that was not managed 
by a server or central authority Essentially cryptocurrencies are digital money created 
from code The data is encrypted and encoded to signify a single unit of currency Such 
currencies are not secured by people or by trust but by pure mathematics making it a 
more secure system because it is not impacted by central banks and monetary supply It 
is also almost immune to corruption As well as Bitcoin there is Ripple Litecoin Ethereum 
and Monero to name a few Blockgeeks 2016 
These digital currencies both universal cryptocurrencies and loyalty currencies are 
challenging the traditional banking and international monetary system Individuals are 
losing trust in banks and national governments roles in monetary policy
However it must be acknowledged that cryptocurrencies carry their own level of risk 
and weaknesses One of the criticisms levelled against cryptocurrencies is the enormous 
pressure it puts on the environment due to the massive amounts of energy required to 
run the mining servers People are also not as trusting of cryptocurrencies yet because 
they do not necessarily understand it or know how it works Because the currency is not 
necessary linked to traditional currency people may not understand where their money 
has gone or how to use it
