CREATING
Having a brand channel is perfect for content marketing Content shared on your brand channel 
should not be too promotional but should offer value to your viewers Some promotion is 
expected and accepted by viewers but if you want to entertain viewers and encourage them 
to subscribe and continue to tune in to view your content it needs to offer value 
Using social platforms such as YouTube allows 
brands and video creators to tap into an existing 
community of avid video viewers For example 
YouTube has changed the way we view video 
commercials Marketers have shown that if 
an advert is good enoughmany users will choose to watch it Super Bowl commercials for 
example are highly anticipated each year and the best ones receive millions of online video 
views These are users who have chosen to watch this advert at a media cost of zero Other 
advertisers have realised that far longer adverts can be created and uploaded As long as the 
content is good users will watch and hopefully share Time constraints online are not the 
same as they are for television networks 
Online video sharing also makes it possible for conferences to generate a far greater audience 
than ever before The companies that run these conferences are able to engage with a massive 
audience by posting videos of the conference presentations an excellent example of content 
marketing TEDand Nokia which runs Nokia World are excellent examples of organisations 
that increase interest by making their remarkable presentations available for free 
YouTubes Community tab
YouTube has created the Community tab which allows viewers to respond to a creators posts 
It allows users to reply to messages with text to react and share their thoughts Brands can 
make posts consisting of text image polls or video and users can respond to these making 
YouTube a far more social platform than before
