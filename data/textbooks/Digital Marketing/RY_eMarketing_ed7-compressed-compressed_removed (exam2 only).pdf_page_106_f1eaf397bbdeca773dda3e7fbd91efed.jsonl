Like Instagram Twitter users use hashtags to categorise their posts by adding a word or phrase 
prefaced with the  symbol eg DigitalMarketing The hashtag will become a link that you 
can click to see other tweets that share this tag Users can also choose to follow a hashtag 
meaning that they will see all public messages with that tag whether they follow the user 
who posted it or not This can be a very useful way of collating information at events such as 
conferences If youre not at the event you can still follow messages from the event by following 
the hashtag For those at the event all tagged messages can be broadcast in a shared location
