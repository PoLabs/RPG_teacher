Tracking and analysis
For example it is not that helpful to say that 10 of this months web traffic converted Is that 
good or bad high or low But saying that 10 more users converted this month than last 
month shows a positive change or trend While it can be tempting to focus on single hero 
numbers and excitinglooking figures such as Look we have 5000 Facebook fans these 
really dont give a full picture if they are not presented in context In fact we call these vanity 
metrics because they look good but they dont really tell you much
Monitoring performance and trends will help 
you determine the next steps to improve your 
impact in the market customer engagement 
and increased sales by generating new leads 
2032 Big data
Big data is the term used to describe truly vast data sets the ones that are so big and unwieldy 
that they require specialised software and massive computers to process Companies like 
Google Facebook and YouTube generate and collect so much data every day that they have 
entire warehouses full of hard drives to store it all 
Understanding how it works and how to think about data on this scale provides some valuable 
lessons for all analysts Here are three
1	 Measure trends not absolute figures The more data you have the more meaningful it 
is to look at how things change over time 
2	 Focus on patterns With enough data patterns over time should become apparent so 
consider looking at weekly monthly or even seasonal flows 
3	 Investigate anomalies If your expected pattern suddenly changes try to find out why and 
use this information to inform your actions going forward 
2033 Data mining
Data mining is the process of finding patterns hidden in large numbers and databases Rather 
than having a human analyst process the information an automated computer programme 
pulls apart the data and matches it to known patterns to deliver insights This can often reveal 
surprising and unexpected resultsand tends to break assumptions 
Data mining in action
Krux 2016 offers the example of examining an enormous dataset for an automotive brand 
that wanted to improve brochure downloads and increase requests for test drives The 
data they analysed related to consumers consumer attributes and marketing touchpoints 
To determine a pattern they had to explore 47000000000000000000000 fortyseven 
sextillion combinations of factors too many to evaluate without using machines 
Pay close attention to any changes in 
the expected data good or bad and 
investigate any anomalies
