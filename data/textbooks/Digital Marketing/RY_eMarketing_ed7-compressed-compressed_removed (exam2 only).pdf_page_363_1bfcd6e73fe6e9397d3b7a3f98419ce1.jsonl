  ANTICIPATING
THE METAVERSE VS THE MULTIVERSE 
The ongoing transformation of technologies is enabling us to connect and interact with each 
other and our environments in ways that we could only ever have imagined Technology has 
caught up with fiction and it is now time to familiarise ourselves with the concepts of the 
alternate worlds in which we are venturing Understanding some of the key differences between 
these verses can shed some muchneeded light on how we navigate and make the most of 
them for the benefit of our customers and brand purpose 
The concepts of the metaverse and virtual multiverse are currently in their infancy 
stages Because we cannot predict the future or how these will be adopted we are 
wary of defining them too narrowly In the current context the metaverse is a concept 
for a connected virtual world whereas the multiverse provides the potential for multiple 
digital ecosystems While we are exploring the metaverse and multiverse in their current 
context we are also cognisant of the progress and influence it will have in future on how 
the digital world evolves 
The metaverse explained 
Considering the metaverse is meant to be the next evolution of the internet there are several 
differing ideas and views of what it is going to be It is meant to serve everyone which is why 
it will be different for different people and their needs 
According to the most cited definition of the metaverse by one of the industrys top metaverse 
influencers Matthew Ball 2018 updated 2021 and 2022 the metaverse  is a massively scaled 
and interoperable network of realtime rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced 
synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual 
sense of presence and with continuity of data such as identity history entitlements objects 
communications and payments 
Even Ball who ventured out to give his best shot at a definition acknowledges that to provide 
a single allencompassing definition of the metaverse is impossible since this largescale 
disruption is still in its infancy It should however not be seen as virtual reality rather as a 
shared digital environment where all digital actions can occur Anyone can be part of the 
metaverse and participate in a specific eventplaceactivity The metaverse is designed to be 
a social environment that requires users to create a virtual identity in the form of an avatar
The metaverse will become a fully functioning economy where individuals and businesses will 
be able to create own invest sell and be rewarded for a range of socalled work This body 
of work for which the creators will have ownership produces value which is recognised by 
others Ball 2020
