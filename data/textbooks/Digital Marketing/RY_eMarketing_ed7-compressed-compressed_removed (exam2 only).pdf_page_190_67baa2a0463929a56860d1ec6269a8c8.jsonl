The problem
Amazon noticed that shipping was often a stumbling block when it came to completing 
purchases If shipping took too long users would drop out of the purchase Similarly if 
users purchased an item that was less than the minimum to receive free shipping they 
would also abandon the purchase They needed to somehow streamline this process so 
that customers would complete their purchases 
They considered a loyalty program that would address these two aspects but knew that 
customers are inundated with loyalty programmes that offer cashback rewards and 
promotions Every retailer bank and service provider offer some form of loyalty programme 
that is very similar to all the others 
Amazon noted that many loyalty programmes fail because they dont meet the needs of the 
customer and promise delayed gratification They offer customers nothing new nor anything 
they can derive any real benefit from in the short term Customers have to build up points 
and cashbacks and wait to receive their reward Many customers have become wary of 
loyalty programs seeing them as another way to extort more money from consumers
Customers need something that offers real benefits for which they are willing to pay 
US139 a year They want real value immediately and not something they need to wait 
months or years to see any benefit from 
The solution
Amazon Prime provides its customers with what they really want and need from the 
brand It has created a program that is designed to meet their customers need for instant 
gratification and removes the stumbling blocks in the purchase process Prime members 
receive next day delivery on all items and do not need any minimum value in their shopping 
carts to receive free shipping They reap the benefits of the program immediately and 
every time they shop online 
Instead of making these shipping features free Amazon Prime made the service part of an 
exclusive loyalty programme that users had to pay a yearly fee to benefit from In addition 
to tapping into instant gratification Amazon Prime also made use of customers desire to 
be involved in something exclusive that would set them apart from general customers 
As well as shipping benefits Amazon Prime users would get access to exclusive deals 
and discounts as well as the first option on new products Prime members get to see and 
purchase products before they are made available to other customers
To ensure they provided perceived real value Amazon also included access to their entire 
library of Amazon Prime videos in the Prime membership Amazon Prime has started to 
produce its own content for Amazon Prime called Amazon Originals This means that 
the customer receives great value in the form of online viewing content and the brand 
gains invaluable input that it can use to fuel further development
