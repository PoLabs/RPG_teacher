Figure 1322 An example of the 2016 HarleyDavidson posts on Instagram
The solution
Harley Davidson decided to use Instagram ads for the first time to reach 1835yearold 
men in Australia and New Zealand
HarleyDavidson used a series of illustrations to fit in with the visual nature of Instagram 
They wanted to appeal to young adventurous people who appreciate the world through a 
more visual lens The brand identified three themes they felt resonated with their intended 
audience and tapped in to their own artistic heritage of seeing motorcycles as pieces of 
art The brand commissioned local Australian artists to interpret these themes
The illustrations were displayed as carousel ads for each theme When swiped the images 
connected to form a storyline The visual style was designed to mimic tattoolike images 
and motifs that are popular in biking culture
