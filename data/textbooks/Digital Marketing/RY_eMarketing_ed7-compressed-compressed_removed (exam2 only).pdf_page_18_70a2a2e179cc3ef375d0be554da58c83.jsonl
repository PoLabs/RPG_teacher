The constraints with developing for a range of devices 
Due to the size constraints of mobile device screens various considerations must be taken 
into account to allow your website to render correctly
Fluid CSS layouts will allow the site to manipulate its contents based on screen size Additionally 
CSS media queries can use target styles for a specific screen width height and pixel density 
Working with a touchscreen means that no 
hover effects will work Adequate space must 
be allowed around inputs due to the touch
area of some users fingers being larger than 
a mouse cursor
Images must be optimised for mobile screens and bandwidth restrictions 
Development approaches 
Here are some development approaches that you may want to consider
Specialised mobile development

mobile penetration is so heavy and many users worldwide will access the internet first and 
primarily through mobile Chaffey 2016 every website needs to be designed with the mobile 
device in mind Mobile website interfaces demand a simpler approach and a consideration of 
screen size and input method A specific design for various mobile screen sizes in the form of 
an adaptive design may be an option However Google prefers responsive to adaptive sites

A native mobile app is software designed to help users perform particular tasks Examples 
include a tool for checking the weather a fuel calculator or an airlines app to checkin or to 
track flight progress

income while free apps that offer users value are often sponsored by brands or advertising 
An app can be an excellent tool for connecting with your customer 
The key difference between native applications and mobileoptimised websites is that native 
applications are designed for particular handsets and operating systems and have to be 
downloaded to the mobile device Mobileoptimised websites can be accessed using any 
internetenabled mobile device That said mobile apps can allow for more integration with the 
device and hence a better user experience depending on the complexity of the functionality
