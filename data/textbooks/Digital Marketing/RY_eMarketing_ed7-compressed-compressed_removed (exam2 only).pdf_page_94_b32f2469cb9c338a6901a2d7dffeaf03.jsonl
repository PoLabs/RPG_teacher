Instagram video reels and stories
Before Instagram removed it in October 2021 Instagram Television IGTV was home to longer 
highquality edited videos of up to 60 minutes that were recorded on web uploaders People 
would compare IGTV with YouTube because it offered a space for users to discover content 
that covered a topic in detail eg howtos educational videos
IGTV was losing traction as a standalone app and in 2020 Instagram dropped the button from 
its homepage Instead Instagram Video is hosted alongside Instagram Live videos Trimming 
filters and tagging form part of the functions on Instagram Video when uploading content It 
worked similarly to IGTV in that 60 second videos show a preview in the Feed 
With the introduction of TikTok to the social media scene and the massive uptake of short form 
video by industry giant YouTube Instagram decided to prioritise the shift to video It no longer 
wants to be seen as just a photosharing app which is why it is focused on making video a 
more central part of the Instagram experience 
Instagram reels
Reels is Instagrams answer to TikTok videos Its core purpose is to be entertaining which is 
why it is limited to 60 seconds in length One feature of Instagram Reels is the builtin editing 
functionality You can also slow down or speed up your clip add filters mix in audio include 
a voiceover add on music and more 
It has proven successful for brands and businesses to get creative in the Reels arena where 
their brand may be seen by all Instagram accounts rather than only followers because they are 
far more discoverable on Instagram They may not have the frontandcentre prominence of 
Stories at the top of the Instagram app but they are regularly featured in the Discover section 
The Reels tab appears on the primary navigation of the app
Reels has a longer lifespan than Stories it can be picked up by the Instagram algorithm 
at any point making them more likely to be found by new prospects It is best to edit
