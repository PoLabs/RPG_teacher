Conversion optimisation
viewing that specific page Of course if you are running advertising campaigns to direct traffic 
to the page being tested you can always spend a bit more money to increase the number of 
users coming to that page
You also want to determine what percentage of users will be involved in the test In a simple 
AB test if you include 100 of your visitors in the test 50 will see version A and 50 will 
see version B If you include only 50 of your visitors in the test this means that 25 of your 
overall visitors will see version A and 25 will see version B Including 100 of your visitors 
will give you results more quickly However you may be concerned that your alternative version 
could perform worse and you dont want to compromise your performance too much 
Change in conversion rate 
While this is not something you will know upfront the percentage change in conversion 
rate also affects the length of a test The greater the change the more quickly a statistically 
significant decision can be made 
Number of variations 
The more variations you have the longer it will take to determine which combination performs 
the best 
These factors can then be used to calculate the suggested length of time for a test to run 
There are several online calculators that do this for you A good one to try is this one offered 
by Visual Website Optimizer vwocomtoolsabtestdurationcalculator

Figure 216 Small changes can affect your online testing 
It is usually preferable to test bigger changes or variations rather than very small ones unless 
you have a very large audience
