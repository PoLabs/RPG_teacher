Experience 
According to Takyar CEO of LeewayHertz nd the metaverse will not be limited to a 3D version 
of the real world for only viewing Rather it will be a true interpretation of the dimensions and 
distances of photorealistic graphic elements with the potential to provide experiences that 
the real world cannot offer 
For instance wellknown brands are putting their money into massive interactive live events 
hosted on platforms like Roblox and Decentraland offering a glimpse of how events and 
activities in the metaverse can manifest interactivity How this will differ from real life is that 
frontrow ticket experiences will be open to anyone
The metaverse is all about experiences From games and social interactions to shopping 
theatre and esports the potential future metaverse can transform human experiences with 
its immersive and realtime space
Discovery 
This second layer is about experiential discoveries that result in a search and find approach to 
familiarise users with new experiences On the one hand users proactively look for information 
and experiences and on the other they receive information on what experiences await them 
in the metaverse 
The discovery layer is the most beneficial for businesses It is cost effective and relies on 
communitydriven content word of mouth reviews shared experiences and testimonials to 
get people to discover metaverse experiences 
Creator economy 
Ultimately the metaverse will create an immersive 3D world with interconnected virtual spaces 
that mirror reality Powered by AR VR and similar technologies the spaces will be designed 
to attract visitors who will be able to do virtually anything once in that space 
Content creators will play an essential role in creating this new world and experts believe the 
metaverse will make the creator economy a multibilliondollar industry The creator economy 
will be made up of independent creative people who produce digital content such as images 
and videos ebooks webinars art and blog posts They will use the metaverse to generate 
revenue by selling goods displaying and selling collections collaborating with brands 
and promoting them influencing buying behaviour by posing in avatar fashion apparel and 
accessories and so on
Whilst accepting that the metaverse can and will open a promising new market for the 
creator economy it is still being heavily debated whether the metaverse is a good thing 
or if it will have negative effects on our future Apart from the immersive experiences
