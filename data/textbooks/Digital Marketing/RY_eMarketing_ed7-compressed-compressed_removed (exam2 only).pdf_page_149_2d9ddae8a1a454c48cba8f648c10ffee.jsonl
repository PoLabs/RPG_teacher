Content plans help you to plan your community conversations and the messages you send We 
suggest aligning your content with your objectives Decide on what you want to achieve with 
each objective by when and what level of priority it is for your business Map these objectives 
weekly and monthly as necessary Then create weekly or monthly content plans around these 
objectives based on each objectives relative priority for your business per week 
For example if your objectives are brand awareness sales and app installs you need to weigh 
them according to their importance If your main objective on social media is brand awareness 
make this 50 of your content plan This means that 50 of all content you post will be aimed 
at increasing brand awareness If the other two objectives are equivalent then content driving 
sales and content driving app installs should each make up 25 of your content plan If this 
changes over time so that in week three you want app installs to be your most important 
objective then content driving app installs becomes 50 of your content plan with content 
promoting brand awareness dropping down to making up only 25 of your content plan 
Content plans are useful centralised planning documents that ensure that various teams are 
aware of each others efforts and that communications are integrated For any kind of content 
and communication strategy content plans are invaluable Be sure your content plan speaks 
to your objective your brand identity your chosen target audience and the themes or topics 
you have selected 
Reaching social audiences requires that you 
create content that truly resonates with them 
Successful social content must be interest
ing relevant shareable and authentic It is 
especially useful to plan and create social content around your content pillars since this gives 
you a solid structure and starting point to follow 
To start creating a conversation calendar you should plot everything that is relevant to your 
community This could include public events dates and anniversaries or events and commu
nications already planned by your organisation 
You should also use your conversation calendar for reporting Keeping track of interactions and 
responses to your planned posts will help you to determine what kind of posts your community 
responds to what days are best for posting and what frequency works best for your community 
CoSchedulecom a content marketing editorial calendar software provides some guidance on 
how often to post on each platform Some platforms like Twitter and Pinterest require frequents 
posts each day while Facebook Instagram and LinkedIn require less posts CoSchedule Blog

However with platform algorithms changing all the time the frequency of posts is becoming 
less important A great post will circulate and appear in newsfeeds for much longer because 
it has good relevant content
