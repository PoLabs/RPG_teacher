What they offer Snapchat has come a long way since its origin as a niche platform mostly 
used by teenagers It still has a lot of pull with young demographics and it encourages realtime 
content creation and consumption with users paying more attention to content Facebook 
Instagram and WhatsApp have been fairly 
blatant about stealing Snapchats features 
including Stories and Filters which could 
mean a dropoff in users over time However 
Snapchat is fighting back with new offerings 
such as Lenses and Virtual Reality Tryons
