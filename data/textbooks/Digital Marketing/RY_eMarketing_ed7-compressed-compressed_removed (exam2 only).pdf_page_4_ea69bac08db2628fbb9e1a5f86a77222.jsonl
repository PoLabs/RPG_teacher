73 WEB DESIGN 
Web design is the process of creating all the visual aspects of the interface This covers the 
layout colour scheme images logos type design elements such as buttons and links and 
anything else that you can see 
The web is a visual medium so design is an important part of creating assets that are both 
engaging and effective Designers need to keep in mind the technical aspects of design while 
prioritising the human factor Digital properties shouldnt only look beautiful They need to 
create a good experience for the visitor and meet business objectives such as increasing 
sales creating brand ambassadors and encouraging signups and encouraging signups 
that ultimately result in conversions
731 Visual identity and designing for persuasion 
The visual interface or the design of a website is what users see and interact with Its the 
visual representation of all the hard work that goes into developing a website Its what the 
site will be judged by first and is the initial step in creating a delightful user experience The 
interface matters A lot 
There is a close relationship between UX and UI Ideally the UI designer will use the documents 
created by the UX designer and add the visual skin but often the designer has to manage both 
UX design and visual design 
Design is not just about aesthetics although looks are very important Design is about the 
visual clues we give users so that they know what to do next It assures web visitors of our 
credibility and turns them into customers 
The visual designer plays a key role in defining good interface design which involves many 
things closely linked to UX Here are a few basic considerations
	
Navigation The signage of the site indicating to users where they are and where they can go
	
Layout How content is structured and displayed
	
Headers The element with a fixed position at the top of every page this usually includes 
all primary navigation items that need to be presented on every page such as main menu 
login and search
	
Footers The usually consistent bottom part of the page
	
Credibility The professionalism implied by a welldesigned site that tells users that you 
are who you say you are
