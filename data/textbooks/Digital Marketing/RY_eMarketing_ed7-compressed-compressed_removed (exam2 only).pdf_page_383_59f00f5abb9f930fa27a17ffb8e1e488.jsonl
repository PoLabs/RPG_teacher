THE BIGGER PICTURE 
Decentralisation infinite connections and opportunities to create explore and experience a 
limitless reality are all enticing concepts for human curiosity and evolution With the metaverse 
it becomes possible in ways that we have not yet imagined As the movement progresses and 
industry leaders gain ground in this dynamic space we can expect to see erratic growth and 
innovation by new entrants and inventive creatives 
The metaverse is expected to unlock an abundance of opportunities As a result of lessons 
learned from Web20 as far as privacy and protection of personal information is concerned 
there is a solid base that serves as reference for us not to repeat those mistakes However we 
are embarking on an unknown journey at this stage  a new frontier  that will require unique 
skills a thorough understanding of human behaviour and interactions customer experiences 
and brand purpose To navigate successfully we need to keep our heads in the game and our 
hearts on our purpose
SUMMARY 
One of the pertinent things that we advocate for as far as brand building and customer 
engagement is concerned is brand storytelling Brands are about experiences and creating 
a sense of belonging and connectedness It helps define our social statuses which is why 
we do not pursue technology for its own sake but rather use it to allow us to do things that 
we could not do before The fundamentals of human interaction and what we value does not 
change however how we engage evolves with the right enablement
Although there are plans and visions to create a virtual version of the real world in the metaverse 
it is important that brand marketing and business leaders are not distracted by the technology 
but rather remain focused on their customers and their purpose It is important to plan and 
prepare for the metaverse and adapt to the changing environment
The metaverse has the potential to change the world where people will be able to go to places 
they would never be able to go explore things they would never be able to see and feel things 
they would never be able to feel We have come a long way since 1992 when Neal Stephenson 
coined the term metaverse in his novel Snow Crash But we still have a long way to go and 
while it is important to investigate these new opportunities and cool technology we also have 
to stay grounded and understand the nature of other realities The Crypto Pie 2022
