CLAIMING
At the same time consider what content you 
want to include on your site Will it be a 
relatively static site that doesnt change often 
or will you need an editable CMS to regularly 
add and update content such as blog posts 
images and products
Should the website be large enough to 
require it a functional specification document 
should be created using all the information 
compiled so far This document should detail 
the development requirements for the website 
and can be used to communicate any specific design constraints 
Its now time to move on from planning to building 
Search engine visibility 
Search engine traffic is vital to a website without it the chances are that the site will never 
fulfil its marketing functions It is essential that the search engines can see the entire publicly 
visible website index it fully and consider its relevance for its chosen keywords 
Search engine optimisation SEO has its own chapter in this textbook Chapter 5 but here 
are the key considerations for web development and design 
In web developmentthe copy that is shown on the web page needs to be kept separate 
from the code that tells the browser how to display the web page This means that the search 
engine spider will be able to discern easily what content is to be read and therefore scanned 
by the spider and what text is an instruction to the browser Cascading Style Sheets CSS 
can take care of that 
If the search engine cannot see the text on the page it means that it cannot crawl and index 
that page 
Step 2 Design 
Design usually happens before development According to the steps explained earlier in this 
chapter the designer will transform the wireframes and basic planning materials into beautifully 
designed layouts These are static images that show how the website will look once its coded 
Step 3 Development 
The development phase usually kicks in once the design is finished Developers will sometimes 
start their involvement as early as the wireframe stage by creating lowfidelity prototypes to 
support the usertesting process Normallythe developer uses the design templates to code the 
actual website using the frontend language that you have chosen Serverside development 
and CMS considerations may also be part of this phase
