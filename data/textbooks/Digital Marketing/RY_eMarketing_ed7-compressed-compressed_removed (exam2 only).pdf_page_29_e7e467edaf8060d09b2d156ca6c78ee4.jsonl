CLAIMING
The Agile method is a series of sprints and involves working through iterative incremental 
cycles Agile methodology is more collaborative less rigid and requires incremental investments 
It often results in being able to release the final product to the market faster The collaborative 
approach means that instead of handing over the project to the next person in the chain you 
work together catching any issues and working on each iteration as you move through each 
process The Agile method often involves scrum 
methodology and requires or at least tries for 
each sprint to produce something that has an 
increment of product functionality Joel 2015 
Figure 715 The Agile method
Careful consideration of the specific project the goals and ultimately the clients needs will 
decide which of these methods is appropriate for a specific project The method chosen should 
be the one that will best fit the required project goals 
77 QUALITY ASSURANCE 
The software development cycle has one 
final step before the website goes live quality 
assurance This is often referred to as QA It is 
a crucial step to ensure that website delivery 
is of the highest standard and that the client 
expectation is in line with the agreed Statement 
of Work This step is independent of the design and development phases and involves various 
enduser test cases Test cases ensure that the graphical user interface GUI promotes a 
great user experience UX QA involves two steps functional and userinterface testing
