124 VIDEO PRODUCTION STEPBYSTEP
Creating video content for the web can be easy and cost effective but it will always involve 
a lot of research thought and planning before you even get started with filming Remember 
you are not making a video seriespodcast for a brand you work on or a brand you know The 
content you are creating is the brand
1241 Know your audience 
As always you first need to identify the audience for whom you are creating this video content 
What are their wants and needs What video content are they already consuming Where 
are they consuming it How can you engage their attention provide something valuable that 
fits the platform and promote your brand at the same time Some solid market research will 
reveal the answers to these questions 
1242 Planning and conceptualising
Planning is your priority for successful video production Brainstorm some ideas You will need 
to come up with the core concept for the video which will be determined by what your target 
audience wants If you dont yet know what that is go back to your target audience and ask 
what they need A few questions you may ask yourself here are
	
Why would they watchlisten to your product 
	
What do they need from it 
	
Would they be likely to share it with others 
Decide on the best style and tone in which to convey this and then get into what each of your 
episodes is going to be about It should be a logical narrative each one closely related to your 
specific angle Your episodes can be part of a continuous story like in a podcast thats about 
one story or different aspects under your topic umbrella
Once you have decided these aspects you have what you need to start planning your actual 
video shoot Write a script or at least prepare a breakdown of what the video should include 
and schedule the shoot Consider the venue crew requiredactors and any other props or 
elements you will need How long this takes will depend on the complexity of the video youre 
planning and your budget
