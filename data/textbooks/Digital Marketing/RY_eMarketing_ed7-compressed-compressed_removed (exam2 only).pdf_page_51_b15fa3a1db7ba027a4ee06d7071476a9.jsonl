CREATING
You would have learned more about this in Chapter 5 Search engine optimisation Optimising 
video for search involves understanding the basics of SEO as well as the particular challenges 
and tactics of optimising video content 
Search engines rely on being able to use text in the content to determine what it is about 
and other indicators to determine how relevant that content is When it comes to web pages 
search engines can read the text on the page to determine what the page is about Moreover 
they can measure the links coming in to determine how relevant the page is 
When it comes to video although the search engine cannot watch orread the video in 
the same way that a human can there are technological solutions that are starting to make 
this possible For instance Google Search tries to automatically detect the segments in your 
video and show key moments to users without any effort on your part Alternatively you can 
manually tell Google about the important points of your video by visiting this site developers

To do so manually it is good practice to include metadata to determine what the video is about 
The search engine also needs to look for ways to measure relevance 
Marketers and website owners now need to optimise all forms of content whether it be for text 
pages images or videos in order to achieve better rankings Video search engine optimisation 
VSEO involves the use of basic SEO foundations and additional creative optimisation methods 
to ensure that online video content appears higher up on the SERPs 
Optimising video for videosharing sites such as YouTube means that your video will appear 
in search results on the videosharing site and also on SERPs such as Google While each 
videosharing site will use its own algorithm the guidelines below can be considered best 
practice across most of the videosharing sites 
Video titles are very important 
A video title is one of the first things a user sees 
when clicking through to a video It is used first 
and foremost by the video search engines to 
determine the relevance of your video to the 
search query Your most important keywords 
should appear in the first three words of the title Longer descriptive titles are better than 
shortconcise and obscure ones 
If you have a great title it will grab the attention of the audience and you will get a lot 
of views Promise value to the user with the title and sparkle interest A power word or 
two will grab the attention but make sure it is not sensational or misleading Steer clear 
of clickbait such as How to get fit without exercise
If you are creating a video series use a 
standard naming structure for the title to 
make all videos easier to find
