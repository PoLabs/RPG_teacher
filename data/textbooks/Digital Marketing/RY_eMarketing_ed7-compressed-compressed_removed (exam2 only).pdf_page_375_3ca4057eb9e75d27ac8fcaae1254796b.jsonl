determine what technology will do to support it This is why businesses and brands should decide 
sooner rather than later if they will join the initial phase or wait to see how it plays out  and risk 
missing the opportunity to influence the design of the metaverse during the early stages
The immersive virtual environment of the 
metaverse offers brands the opportunity 
to connect and engage with their existing 
consumers in fresh new and authentic ways 
while attracting new consumers to their brand 
Inventing a world designed specifically for your 
audience is one way to show your commitment 
to creating shared value 
To reach customers in the metaverse there are 
a few approaches that are not far off what we already know  the only difference is how we 
will interact with the information and data 
Here are some of the ways brands are using the metaverse
	
Engagement and awareness Brand experiences through gaming are becoming popular 
For instance Nike has partnered with Roblox to create a game called Nikeland where users 
participate in games Other brands have created their own games where players can go 
on a quest or adventure to gather collectibles that may be exchanged for real life value Its 
about creating engagement for the brand recognition and experience
	
Special events Using existing platforms like Fortnite and Roblox to virtually launch events 
such as product or movie launches and concerts has become a viable option for brands 
especially since the pandemic and global lockdowns
	
Marketing opportunities Brands are looking at ways to use their memorabilia logos and 
virtual assets in the metaverse For instance Coca Cola auctioned off memorabilia for NFTs 
while Nike is looking at ways to trademark to produce and sell virtual branded apparel for 
avatars and the like 
The metaverse will be a goldmine for growth marketers because of its datadriven capabilities 
through the virtual world on which it is built The devices that it will be using such as VR 
glasses will generate masses data that may be used to promote value to the audience both 
in the metaverse and in the real world This means that the detailed behavioural patterns 
that will be tracked on VR devices may be used to connect with similar personas on reallife 
marketing channels
Note The metaverse will have a huge impact on growth marketing Even if you dont plan 
to use the metaverse as a marketing platform you can still use data from the metaverse 
to fuel your growth marketing strategy Barrett 2022
