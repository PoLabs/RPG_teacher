Apps 
CRM apps are a great step forward in customer relationship management They help to 
track customer contact info which members of your team they interacted with their emails 
and positions as well as the last conversation the customer had with your company Larger 
companies make use of software tools like Salesforce but the high price tag makes the software 
unattainable for small businesses and startups 
CRM apps like HubSpot CRM Zoho CRM and Intercom are popular choices If youre looking 
for a fullfeatured CRM HubSpot works for up to 1 million contacts and integrates with Gmail 
or Microsoft Outlook Google contacts is a nice simple choice that works inside of Gmail and 
is ideal for smaller businesses and startups Intercom is a CRM that focuses on what people 
view on your site so that you can track what they are likely to purchase It links user behaviour 
to user profiles and the paid options include chat options that allow you to chat directly with 
customers online Zoho is a great choice if you already use Zoho software 
Apps are making CRM easier by managing your contacts and tracking their interactions with 
your brand They continue to get better and better and brands should be making use of these 
useful tools 
Apps for payment services 
As well as CRM apps brands can develop loyalty apps that also enable payment Brand specific 
apps that enable purchases are becoming a preferred means of payment The Starbucks 
Rewards program accounts for almost 50 of Starbucks revenue as of October 2020 Over 
60 of millennials are happy to use apps to purchase products in store which is changing the 
landscape of loyalty currencies and how such currencies are managed by brands BizCommunity 
2017 More and more brands are offering payment gateways and even credit and microloans 
through their apps This is impacting how customers view brands as service providers and 
greatly changing how they see banks and traditional monetary institutions 
SMS 
SMS is a handy tool for communicating with 
customers about product delivery and updating 
them about specials and promotions As with 
all mobile channels you will have access to 
your customer exactly where they are at that 
moment and in a very personal space Therefore use this channel responsibly and only when you 
have permission to do so Sending endless SMSes can lead to customers removing themselves 
from your SMS contact list and could give that customer a negative perception of your brand 
Live chat
Having the ability to chat to your customers when they are on your site is very useful in addressing 
customer queries immediately and can lead to valuable conversions Real live customer service
