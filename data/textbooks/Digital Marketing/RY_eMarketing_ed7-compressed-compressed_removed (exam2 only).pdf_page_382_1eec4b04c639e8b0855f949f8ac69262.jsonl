CASE STUDY TABLE MOUNTAIN CABLEWAY TAKES DIGITAL TRIP 
Oneline summary
Due to lockdown regulations since 2020 and operational disruptions because of the 
weather the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway Company TMACC launched an innovative 
addition to their offering that would allow anyone to have a virtual experience of the tour 
to the top of Table Mountain
The problem
In summer TMACC lost about 20 of the cableway capacity to the South Easterly wind 
To solve this challenge the company decided that a digital twin of the experience would 
meet the peak summer demand and serve additional purposes of attracting international 
audiences to this tourism destination
The solution 
A virtual experience of the cableway cart was created to give the customer the same 
butterfly effect of going up inside the cableway cart This immersive experience looks and 
feels like the real experience In this way the company not only offered the experience to 
anyone who could not be there but also aligned itself with new technology
The results
In addition to the commercial benefits to tourists and visitors many children living in 
Cape Town and the Cape Flats who have never experienced the mountain before now 
have access to the experience For TMACC being able to do outreach and inspire young 
people around them is invaluable The virtual cableway cart experience is the best digital 
twin Cape Town has created with lasting benefits not only for customers but also its 
surrounding communities
