Because of the gamelike nature of the interactive and immersive experiences Gen Z are firmly 
aligning themselves with many and can be seen as the early adopters in the metaverse This 
opens a variety of possibilities to unlock greater human connections and brand engagement To 
make the most of the metaverse based on what we currently know we recommend prioritising 
these key themes 
Leverage the metaverse for good The possibilities that the metaverse present is an oppor
tunity for us to set the tone and leverage it for good There are no geographical restrictions 
which makes global connections possible in a more realistic way Considering the numerous 
global challenges that we face the metaverse makes it possible for us to garner support for 
movements to address climate change upskill and use training simulations for learning and 
collaborate more closely with teams in the real and virtual worlds
Data driven insights With lessons from Web20 where we learned how data was exploited 
for the benefit of technology giants the metaverse presents an opportunity to do better The 
sheer scale of data transfer in a threedimensional world may raise potential risks and privacy 
concerns which is why it is important that industry leaders focus on leveraging the metaverse 
for good rather than shortterm profit goals 
Human insights Because the world will be more focused on authenticity and more meaningful 
connection human insights will serve as the prime reference point to shape the next frontier 
of human experiences Putting human interests and needs at the centre of the metaverse 
ideation will serve as the moral compass to build trust into the ecosystem of virtual worlds ie 
human safety before brand safety ensuring digital civility 
Brand purpose and value creation Building 
trust is critical for creating longterm value

and reality to stay focused on designing a 
purposeled business with shared value for 
the brand and customer It will take all the key 
themes outlined here together with the brands commitment to generate authentic experiences 
for its stakeholders and services to make sense of the virtual ecosystem
