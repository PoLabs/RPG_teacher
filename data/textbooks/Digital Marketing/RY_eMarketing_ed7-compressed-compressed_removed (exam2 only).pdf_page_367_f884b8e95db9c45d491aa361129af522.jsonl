creative ecosystem combining art collectibles  NFTs to merge realities across digital 
fashion and gaming This NFT marketplace collaborates with artists to create collections 
of collectibles that anyone can own and then use in the metaverse 
Each Dissrup Drop or piece of art must comprise of 3 essentials namely artworks digital 
collectibles and phygital collectables Artwork is defined as single edition NFTs in line 
with the concept of each Dissrup release whereas digital collectables are digital items 
but in limited quantities Phygital collectables are collectables that include a digital as 
well as a physical component 
The digital collectables on Dissrup are affordable items that the owner can use to 
personalise their spaces or avatars on a gaming platform As with some real art they are 
done in limited runs Phygital items are exactly what their name implies a physical and 
a digital component in this case collectables that include both a physical and a digital 
component You can spruce up your metalounge with a digital stateoftheart chair but 
you can also chill on it in the physical world  craftspeople will bring these digital creations

In addition to establishing a creator economy for ordinary people on a global scale the 
metaverse will offer innovations in communication for workplaces and educational institutions 
 a phenomenon that was already seen since 2020 when the world was gripped in a raging 
pandemic 
There are however also some cons to this next best thing the requirement of advanced 
digital technologies which is not a given in developing countries where the digital divide is 
still persisting In addition privacy concerns and security implications are notable metaverse 
pitfalls To quote The conversation 2021 Marginalised people often suffer the most harm from 
unintended consequences of new technologies  Avatars the graphical personas people 
can create or buy to represent themselves in virtual environments are being priced differently 
based on the perceived race of the avatar and racist and sexist harassment is cropping up in 
todays premetaverse immersive environments Regulating tech will be part and parcel of the 
metaverse and all stakeholders will have to find the right balance between freedom of speech 
and freedom of expression and something that is harmful
All involved will have to be cognisant of the pitfalls so that the vast opportunities that the 
metaverse presents do not exclude ordinary marginalised people on a global scale
