CREATING
Optimise the thumbnail
Figure 128 Three thumbnail choices for YouTube videos  note the 
clear branding andor use of people to draw attention 
Video thumbnails let viewers see a quick snapshot of your video as theyre browsing YouTube 
After your video is finished uploading you can choose a thumbnail from the three options 
YouTube automatically generates or upload your own if your account is verified You can look

Consider adding an enticing thumbnail frame YouTube allows you to choose any moment 
in the video to be the thumbnail Many other video platforms also give you this opportunity 
Simply optimising the thumbnail image can encourage increased clickthroughs and views 
which help to increase search visibility 
Use video cards and end screens
Use video cards to link to and from other video 
properties Cards allow you to add text boxes 
with clickable URLs which are crawled by the 
search engine spiders as well at points of your 
choosing in your video Cards in already popular 
and current videos can be used to drive traffic 
to new videos although it should be standard 
practice to include them in a video as soon as 
it has been uploaded Its also a great way to encourage viewers to subscribe to your YouTube 
channel 
The nature of YouTube is such that the number of views for pages on which videos are watched 
is always higher than channel views However if there is a paid search campaign running the 
option to play clicked videos on the channel page exists This is optimal to boost interactions 
with the branded channel header image increase engagement with the playlist and raise the 
channel view stats 
Upload videos regularly
Upload videos regularly to ensure continuous channel activity and topical interest Consider 
the nature of the brand and what you are trying to communicate to your viewers Decide how 
often videos are uploaded but remember the more videos you upload the higher your channel 
A great way to use end screens is to link 
to some of your other videos at the end 
This works similarly to articles you may 
like at the end of a blog post You can 
also use video cards to do this during 
the video
