Social media strategy
Brands should only post content relevant to their objectives not to fill spaces on a content 
calendar Posting poor content to meet a prescribed number of posts may impact your brand 
negatively Because of the algorithms competition for brands to create good content is becoming 
intense but ultimately the user will get to experience better organic content Some brands may 
have to resort to paid media to get their posts seen at all The content you choose to create 
and the frequency of your posts should be informed by your community on each platform 
Planning the conversation helps to keep momentum especially in the early days of building a 
community However it should not replace spontaneity You are creating a conversation after all

important for large organisations where several users might be interacting on social media on 
behalf of a brand or where several departments or agencies have a stake in the organisations

questions and appropriate standard 
responses for both positive and negative 
situations

and risk of messages which include a 
flagging system for comments that need more senior attention
