searchengine friendly The CI is expressed through fonts also known as typefaces 
Typographic layout can draw attention to the content users should see first Indicate which 
pieces of information take precedence Importance can be signified by text size colour weight 
capitalisation and italics Placement also contributes to how important text appears 
Some fonts are common to all computer users 
These fonts are known as web safe fonts 
Anyone accessing websites that use these 
fonts will be able to view them as the designer 
intended and search engines will be able to 
search these websites easily 
Figure 72 Examples of web safe fonts
To drive impact designers typically prefer not 
to be limited to using only web safe fonts and 
brand guidelines in most instances dont take 
web safe fonts into account This means that 
fonts must be embedded by a developer using 
tools such as Typekit or loaded dynamically 
from tools such as Google Fonts 
Figure 73 Examples of Google Fonts 
Some web safe fonts are Times New 
Roman Arial Helvetica Courier New 
and Lucida Console See the full list

You can also use Google Fonts as an 
alternative which are more stylish than
