is a time and resource investment required A 
number of stakeholders will need to be aware 
of your social media plans and these may be both internal and external Of course you will 
need signoff on any budgeting or additional resourcing requirements

planning to take the next steps

your strategy A good first step to understanding the full social media landscape is to listen 
closely to conversations your target market is already having around your brand or industry

wisely and to consider the risks of not 
being on social media as well
