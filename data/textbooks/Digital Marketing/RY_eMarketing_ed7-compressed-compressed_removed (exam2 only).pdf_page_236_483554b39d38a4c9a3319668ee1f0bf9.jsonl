173 UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISING
Social media advertising should be considered as part of an overall social media effort While 
brands can start a Facebook page and share engaging posts those posts would be seen 
only by a fraction of the possible audience even if they have already liked your page It is 
necessary to pay to promote your posts to ensure that you reach a much larger percentage 
of your target audience
Social media advertising is a form of online advertising that takes place on social media 
networks Many platforms offer extraordinarily detailed targeting options that match users 
whom advertisers have identified as belonging to specific purchasing groups making it a 
great way to reach exactly the right group of users with your ads
While more traditional forms of advertising are arguably somewhat inefficient the targeting 
offered by social media platforms make it stand out even from other forms of online advertising 
such as search or display ads Social media platforms also tend to have higher clickthrough 
and engagement rates at a lower cost Hootsuite 2015 
While it is possible to use social media advertising without considering any other aspect of 
your digital marketing strategy it should be considered holistically Chapter 14 Social media 
strategy discusses how social media in general can fit into other channels Social media 
advertising can be used to 
	
Draw attention to products and drive sales
	
Drive traffic to websites and other online properties 
	
Encourage foot traffic 
	
Encourage other activities offline 
Social media used well should be an essential part of any paid media campaign when one 
considers the targeting options and access to consumers it offers
