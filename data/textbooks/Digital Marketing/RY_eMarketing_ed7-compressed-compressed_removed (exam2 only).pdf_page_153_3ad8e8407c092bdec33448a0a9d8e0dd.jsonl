UNITING
When everything being said is nice
A great position to be in on social media is when every possible mention is overwhelmingly 
positive However that doesnt mean that there is nothing to do During this time the brand 
must do everything in its power to drive high volumes of conversation 
Stakeholders are being positive about the brand because their expectations are being exceeded 
Unfortunately expectations change Brands need to stay on their toes and constantly be on 
the lookout for new and innovative ways to meet and develop their brand promise 
When everything being said is neutral 
If this is the case it sounds as if the company is uninspiring which is not a good way to get 
attention If a company is playing it so safe that no one is commenting either praise or criticism 
its in danger of being forgotten The next step is no one talking about the company at all In 
this instance it is important to review your social media strategy content and audience to 
understand why the content is not connecting and then to come up with ways to interact 
with your audience
When negative things are being said 
Negative statements can often be understood 
as broken brand promises If there is underper
formance on expectation it must be resolved as 
a matter of priority During this period brands 
need to be very careful not to stir up any more 
conversation than is absolutely necessary That 
said its certainly not all doom and gloom If 
the conversation is broadly negative it is normally because there is some underlying problem 
and this information offers the business an opportunity to focus and resolve it 
Complaints often come from stakeholders who have had dealings with a company that hasnt 
met their expectations By complaining the customer is often unwittinglygiving the company 
the opportunity to make things right and probably indicating where the company can improve 
Usually the skilled customer service department should deal with these They should also share 
resulting insights with the business strategy department so that the underlying problems can 
be prioritised and resolved on a broader level 
If a complaint is online the resolution should be there as well although you can try to have it 
taken offline first Customer service will likely take place either over email by phone or posting 
a personalised comment in a blog post for example which may demonstrate to the community 
that the company listens respondsand serves the critical objective of actually resolving the 
underlying issues Criticism need not necessarily come from customers but it is important to 
be aware of it If criticism involves false information it should be corrected And if criticism is 
true then it should be dealt with accordingly
Resolving a serious complaint to the 
customers satisfaction can gain you a 
loyal brand advocate someone who has 
firsthand experience that your brand 
cares and goes the extra mile
