Tracking and analysis
With growing consumer privacy concerns evidenced in laws like the EU Privacy Directive 
1995 and the Protection of Personal Information Act PoPIA 2021 which requires websites to 
disclose their cookie usagecookies started to fall out of favour making tracking more difficult 
Googles Universal Analytics changed all of that when it was introduced in 2012 Now about 
a decade later Google will be replacing Universal Analytics with Google Analytics 4 by mid 
2023 Because of its dominance in the search engine market we will focus on how Google 
will affect tracking and measurement using these models
2041 Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4
When it was introduced Universal Analytics set the standard for how user data was collected 
and organised It was designed to offer new tracking codes for websites and features to measure 
user behaviour more accurately This however will be phased out by 1 July 2023 and Google 
Analytics 4 will replace the measurement model
The difference between Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4
According to Boon 2021 the key differences between Universal Analytics and Google Analytics4 
GA4 are as follows
Different measuring models 
Universal Analytics uses a measurement model based on sessions and pageviews A session 
is a group of user interactions hits with a website that takes place over a given timeframe A 
session can contain multiple pageviews events and ecommerce transactions
GA4 uses a measurement model based on events and parameters The principle here is that 
any interaction can be captured as an event As a result all Universal Analytics hit types 
translate to events in GA4
Removal of monthly hit limits 
Another significant difference between Universal Analytics and GA4 is the removal of monthly 
hit limits The free version of Universal Analytics had a monthly limit of 10 million hits which no 
longer exists Instead GA4 has a limit on the number of different events that can be captured 
500 There is at the time of writing no limit as to the volume of hits that can be collected This 
has resulted in a number of clients already opting for a GA4first approach to their analytics
Free connection to BigQuery 
The final difference is GA4s free connection to BigQuery Previously this feature was only 
available to GA360 customers one of the big differentiators between the free and paid versions 
of GA BigQuery enables very large and complex data sets to be queried very quickly and takes 
the data out of GA that gives you the ability to interrogate it without the issue of sampling
