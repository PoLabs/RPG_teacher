221 INTRODUCTION
Technology continues to shape the future of advertising Accelerated by the global lockdowns 
due to COVID19 since the start of 2020 weve witnessed how technology has enabled human 
connection with extraordinary changes that have fasttracked lives globally Our behaviours 
expectations and ultimately our needs have transformed as a result of technology making 
our lives easier faster and more engaging The future of how we interact with the world is 
about to get even more interesting
There are two basic things that you will need to adopt if you as a business owner consultant 
or marketer want to keep abreast of new developments becoming customer and data driven 
Businesses must know who they are selling to and what their customers want 
In the words of Dion Chang trend analyst and founder of Flux Trends Every business needs 
to relook what they do what their business models are and what their purpose is Looking 
at 2020 your customers are no longer where you thought they were and they might not be 
needing what you thought you were selling to them Courie 2021
This chapter takes a holistic view of how businesses need to adapt with the customer and data 
at the centre of it all The various divisions that make a business work can no longer operate 
in silos Business true value and content comes from the whole rather than parts of it
The new normal compels us to create and innovate as we move from the VUCAworld 
volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity into a BANI brittle anxious nonlinear and 
incomprehensible framework to get through the current times 
While BANI is not going to help us solve the challenges of our time any more than VUCA 
did it does offer a fresh and potentially more nuanced way of framing situations and 
conditions that could help to inform strategic leadership Shelley 2021
