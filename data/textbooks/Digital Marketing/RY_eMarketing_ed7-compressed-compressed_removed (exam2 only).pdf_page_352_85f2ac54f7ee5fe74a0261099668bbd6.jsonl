The future of advertising
As a result of their analysis Deloitte developed the following four scenarios for the future 
of advertising
	
Scenario 1 The transactional you
	
Scenario 2 The creative you
	
Scenario 3 The entertained masses
	
Scenario 4 The fragmented masses
This was designed to assist newcomers and existing market players with a form of guardrail 
to navigate the uncertain future of advertising in a digital landscape
The results
The case study revealed the trends that are changing the advertising industry The four 
scenarios reflect on their critical uncertainties in the matrix which may differ in effect 
from scenario to scenario Deloitte identified seven factors for which development could 
be predicted with a high degree of certainty and which are relevant for all scenarios They 
determined that these trends will shape the future of the advertising industry 
Marketing clouds will prevail Marketing clouds will be indispensable elements in adver
tising processes as they control the creation and management of marketing relationships 
and manage campaigns with customers It will become standard to integrate solutions for 
customer journey management email mobile social web personalisation advertising 
content handling and analytics
Artificial intelligence will be imperative AI is ubiquitous in the advertising space AI 
supports decision making and analyses consumer behaviour Enriched with data about 
how consumers interact with advertising it substantially optimises campaigns to perform 
better Implemented consistently and to its full extent AI understands consumers better 
than they do themselves
Programmatic will become universal Programmatic will be the standard for digital 
advertising Processes will be fully automated in the context of purchasing and selling ad 
space and dynamically placing digital ads and transactions will take place in real time 
Programmatic will be an essential enabler for targeted advertising Traditional processes 
involving RFPs human negotiations and manual insertion orders will vanish from the 
digital advertising space
Context is king Digital advertising will be predominantly contextual Ads will be selected 
and placed by automated systems based on ever more detailed user profiles and the 
content displayed The increase in mobile and locationbased advertising will strengthen 
this trend
