Google Analytics 4 tags
Tags allow you to quickly and easily update measurement codes and related code fragments  
collectively known as tags  on your website or mobile app Google Analytics 4 makes use of 
two tag types instead of the one used by Universal Analytics This is how Google explains it
The GA4 Configuration tag initialises Google Analytics for your Google Analytics 4 property 
on a particular page It handles behaviour such as setting of Google Analytics cookies sending 
automatic and enhanced measurement events and declaring common settings The Config
uration tag should be fired on every page where you want to collect data for a Google Analytics4 
property and should be triggered to fire as soon as possible before any other Google Analytics4 
event tags You can configure Fields to Set in the GA4 Configuration tag to set parameters 
that need to remain consistent across all events on a page GA4 Event tags inherit the parameters 
of the GA4 Configuration tag Parameters set by the GA4 Configuration tag remain static for 
all events occurring on a page The parameters are refreshed only when the Configuration tag 
fires again typically the next time the page is loaded
The Google Analytics 4 Event tag lets you 
send custom events to Analytics in addition 
to the events that are sent automatically or 
through enhanced measurement If you 
schedule the configuration tag with an Initial
ization trigger event tags can fire with any other 
triggers and the sequencing will be automat
ically guaranteed
