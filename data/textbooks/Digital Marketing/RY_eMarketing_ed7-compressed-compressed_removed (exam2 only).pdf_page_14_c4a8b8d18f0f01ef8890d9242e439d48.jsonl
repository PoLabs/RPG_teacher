Frontendclientside development languages and frameworks 
Web users have come to expect rich interactive 
experiences online and interactive website 
interfaces are a part of that Frontend 
languages or clientside languages are 
languages that are interpreted and executed 
in users browsers rather than on the web server 
These experiences range from simple animations through to highly responsive interfaces that 
require input from the user There are several technologies available to create such experiences 
each with its own opportunities and challenges 
As with serverside languages you need to consider a few properties of the frontend language 
you want to use Bear in mind that serverside languages and frontend languages are often 
used together as all web projects require frontend languages for development 
Cost Frontend language development costs are comparatively lower than backend costs 
although rich interface developers often demand premium rates 
Features HTML CSS and JavaScript opensource languages are often used together and are 
compatible with most hardware and software Content developed in these is also more search 
engine friendly Today Flash is rarely used despite its interactive multimedia capabilities In 
many cases richer experiences can be achieved with HTML CSS and JavaScript Your most 
important consideration should always be what your end users will be able to view 
Scalability Depending on the capabilities of the device executing the language certain features 
may not be available or certain code may run too slowly to create a good user experience 
The development of frontend code needs to take all the considered devices into account 
Browser and OS support With frontend languages you have to cater for browser and 
operating system support A website will look different on each browser and operating system 
and this needs to be factored in If a feature cannot be displayed under certain conditions 
workarounds have to be implemented A rule of thumb in web development is that a website 
must work on Safari
Opensource or proprietary software Any developer can create addons for or improve on 
opensource software while proprietary software is owned and its use is restricted It can be 
cheaper to develop in an opensource frontend language such as HTML However as HTML 
is needed to host all web pages combinations of open source and proprietary software are 
sometimes used This is however in most cases and for the languages we cover not a major 
consideration 
There are several frontend language options to choose fromalthough the most popular by 
far is HTML coupled with CSS and JavaScript
