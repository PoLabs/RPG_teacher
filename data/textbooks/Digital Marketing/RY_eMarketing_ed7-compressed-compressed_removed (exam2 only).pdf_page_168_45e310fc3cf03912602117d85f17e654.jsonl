Customer relationship managementCRM
Data on its own is meaningless if it is not analysed and acted upon Through analysis data 
can be turned into insights which can then inform the various CRM processes and indeed 
the business itself 
Data should underpin the way each touchpoint is utilised to build loyalty 
Consider the consumer who shops on her store card at a retail outlet Her transactions are 
recorded against her card and she is sent offers that detail the latest fashion trends and earns 
points on her card shopping for these At some point her transactional data shows that she 
has started shopping for baby clothes so she can now be crosssold products and rewarded 
with double points when she buys them Now she is increasing her spending in the store 
crossshopping for both herself and her family and being rewarded for this thus ensuring that 
the retail outlet is offering her value and retaining her business 
1551 Customer data 
A good CRM programme begins with data Who are my customers and what do they want 
What are their demographic and psychographic needs Why did they choose me in the first 
place How many of them are active and continue doing business with me Why do the others 
stop What is the average tenure of a customer 
Figure 154 What do you want to know about your customers 
Often you will need to research this information If the company has a databaseconducting 
surveys focus groups or dipstick telephonic research can help you get an idea Consider that 
an Audi Q7 driver is vastly different to an Audi A1 driver for instance They both pick the brand 
for similar reasons but their motivations behind choosing the products differ vastly
