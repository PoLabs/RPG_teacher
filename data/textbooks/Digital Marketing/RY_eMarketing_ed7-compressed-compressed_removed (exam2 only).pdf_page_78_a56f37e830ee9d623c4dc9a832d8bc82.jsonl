Social media
Users tend to expect that a credible business would have a Page on Facebook Therefore  
neglecting a well thought out presence on the network can lead to lost opportunities 
Reaction buttons
Figure 135 Reaction button icons 
The Facebook reaction buttons allow users to share their feelings about a certain piece of 
content with their social circle The reactions include the original iconic  Like button as well 
as Love Care Haha Wow Sad and Angry 
The Like button can also be used on websites outside of the Facebook ecosystem allowing 
visitors to recommend this site and content easily and to spot if friends have liked the same 
content 
The use of the like button is sometimes tracked 
as a performance indicator for business Pages to 
quantify the amount of reach and engagement 
for a piece of content Liking content signifies 
that someone has actively interacted with 
it while liking a brand Page does not prove 
continual or repeated engagement For this 
reason the number of likes on a brand Page 
can be seen as a vanity metric 
Metrics cant identify who actually read a post but they can show how many users were 
reached shown as impressions through either paid or organic search Impressions shares 
or comments are much more reliable measures of reach and engagement 
Feed
Formerly known as the News feed Feed is the 
term used for the stream of content users see 
when they log on to Facebook It is meant to 
show users stories that are meaningful and 
informative with a selection of recent posts 
and updates from friends and brands with which they have connected on Facebook 
Facebook uses an algorithm to determine what information to show in each users Feed The 
following factors are considered by the algorithm before it displays content in a users news feed 
The heart or Love reaction as well as 
the Like button can be used to gauge 
what content users enjoy the most on 
their newsfeed The Facebook algorithm 
then ensures similar content is shown to 
the user
