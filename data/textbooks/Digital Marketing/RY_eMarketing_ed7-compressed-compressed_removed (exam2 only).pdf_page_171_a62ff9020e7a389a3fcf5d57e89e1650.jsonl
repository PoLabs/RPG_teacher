Analytics data 
Analytics data is generally captured through 
specialised analytics software packages These 
packages can be used to measure most if not 
all digital marketing campaigns Web analytics 
should always look at the various campaigns 
being run For example generating high traffic 
volumes by employing CRM marketing tactics 
like email marketing can prove to be a pointless 
and costly exercise if the visitors who you drive 
to the site are leaving without achieving one 
or more of your websites goals

and some of these can provide valuable insights for CRM implementation This can cover 
everything from quantitative data about number of fans and interactions to qualitative data

by computers which can sift through 
massive amounts of data and find tiny 
but significant patterns that a human 
researcher may overlook
