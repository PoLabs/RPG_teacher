makes sense to purchase your own software

1632 Using mobile for direct marketing 
Remember that users see their mobile as a personal device and can resent intrusions on it This 
means that there are certain principles youll need to keep in mind if you plan to use mobile 
for direct marketing purposes
Privacy and permission 
One of the most important principles for mobile is privacy Users see their mobile as a very 
personal device they dont respond well to unsolicited marketing messages invading that 
privacy The locationbased nature of mobile also presents some challenges to user privacy 
No one wants their location published without their permission and users need to be able to 
control notifications
For a business to avoid damaging its brand by 
coming across as invasive marketers using 
mobile need to use permission marketing and 
make it clear that they will value and respect 
users privacy Users need to opt in to marketing 
messages and should be able to opt out at will 
A strong database of preference profiles and 
constant maintenance of consent can drastically reduce the risks and make users feel more 
in control of their marketing experience 
We have listed some ESPs in the Tools of 
the trade section 186
NOTE
Remember that many countries have 
legislation governing the collection 
storage and use of personal data Make

country
