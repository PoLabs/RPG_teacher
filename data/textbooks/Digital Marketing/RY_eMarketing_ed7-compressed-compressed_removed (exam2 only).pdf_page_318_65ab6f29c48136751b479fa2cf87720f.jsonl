Conversion optimisation
an order or completing a lead generation form However it can also be useful to understand 
less obvious conversions or microconversions 
You could run a test to see what would reduce the bounce rate of a page The aim of an online 
bookstore is to sell books but they could also test to increase newsletter signups and focus 
on selling books later Microconversions can also refer to the path to conversion Often there 
are established steps a visitor should take in the conversion process Conversion optimisation 
can look at each step The Visitor Flow Report in Google Analytics can be a great help in 
providing this insight Knowing what actions or conversions you are testing is about knowing 
the business and its website well 
Who is coming to the site Why
To understand who is coming to the website and why you need to look at data that tells you 
about your visitors and how they got to your website Visitor information includes their location 
and richer demographic information eg age and income if available Another key point to 
look at is the type of device they use eg desktop tablet mobile
To understand why these visitors come to your website you need to be able to analyse your 
sources of traffic The search keywords sending you traffic should tell you something about 
the intent of your visitors for example 
What are they doing on your site 
Of course now you need to understand what your visitors are doing and why theyre not doing 
what you want them to do Here you need to look at metricssuch as bounce rate and exit rate 
for important pages As well as examining your overall conversion rate look at the steps in the 
process and see where those dropoffs occur 
Look at which page is the most visited landing page especially as this may not be the homepage 
Look to see which ones are exit pages and determine if those should be the last pages a user 
sees on your site You can use internal site search information to see if visitors are looking for 
particular information on your website 
2153 Fix anything that is broken
As part of your analysis you may have identified problems that can be fixed without testing 
Before you continue fix these You should also try to understand if there is traffic coming to 
your site that is not relevant Segment that traffic from your calculations 
For example if you have a beautifully designed website that sells custom couchesbut is 
featured in a website design gallery you may get a lot of traffic that is coming only to look at 
your site and not necessarily to buy couches 
2154 Design tests 
By now you should know what areas of your site need testing so its time to design tests
