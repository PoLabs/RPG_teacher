Figure 215 Multivariate testing combines a variety of elements 
Multivariate tests can be more complicated to set up but allow you to test more elements at 
once Multivariate tests are ideal when you have large traffic volumes If traffic volumes are 
not very high it can take a very long time to reach a statistically significant result especially 
if there are many combinations being tested 
2142 Length of tests and sample size 
Several factors determine which tests you can run Relatively simple calculations help you to 
determine how long a test is likely to take which is based on the number of participants as 
well as the improvement in conversion rate Weve included some sample size calculators in 
Section 216 Tools of the trade in this chapter 
Number of participants
