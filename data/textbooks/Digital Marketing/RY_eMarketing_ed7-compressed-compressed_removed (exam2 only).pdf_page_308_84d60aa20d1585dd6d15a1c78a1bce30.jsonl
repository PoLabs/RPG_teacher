split test will help you to determine which version of a subject line improves open rate Within 
an email you can test your call to action copy to see how you can improve clickthrough rates 
Email is also a good medium to test different kinds of offers to see how they influence sales 
These can be combined with testing different types of content long copy versus short copy 
or image versus video 
You can also test delivery days and times for your email either with a split test or by testing 
your whole group at different times of the year
