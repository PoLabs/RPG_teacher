Email and images 
Avoid using images to convey important content Make sure that there is alt text for all images 
used in the email This ensures that the message of the image will still be communicated even 
if the image itself is not seen Even though most email clients display images by default some 
users may still not see them Your email should make sense whether or not the user can see 
images 
Tips for using images in email design
	
In the past background images did not render well in emails but this is changing A block 
background colour tends to display well across most email clients Some email clients like 
Outlook still do not display background images
	
When including images in your HTML be sure to declare the height and width for each 
image to ensure consistent rendering across most email clients 
Emails that make sense without images and 
render correctly across all platforms are more 
likely to persuade a reader to open the email 
and click through to the website

The call to action 
Email design should support calls to action For your campaign to be effective your goals and 
KPIs should be supported by the email layout and design Calls to action can be hyperlinked 
The images you use in the email should 
support the overall message rather than 
convey it directly If the image doesnt 
appear the message should still be clear
