ETHICS AND MARKETING IN THE METAVERSE
New technologies that have endless possibilities must be carefully considered in terms of 
conduct and ethics Currently questions on ethics are almost as infinite as the metaverse 
itself even though cyber laws policies regulations and technology codes of ethics already 
exist The metaverse presents a whole new level of engagement that will eventually connect 
the real world so closely to the virtual that one contemplates questions whether avatars would 
be accepted to represent oneself in virtual form and whether all appearances are acceptable
While the legal fraternity study examine and determine the global and regional laws concerning 
the metaverse marketers will need to examine how ethics and marketing will affect value 
creation for consumers who remain at the centre of it all
The time to take a refreshed look at a business commitment to brand authenticity as well as 
social responsibility and environmental causes is now Ethics and moral discipline for marketing 
in the metaverse will be essential to brands and their customers Marketers will need to dedicate 
themselves to the greater good rather than only the bottom lines to deliver longterm value 
and sustain brand relevance into the future
Based on the set of standards for ethical norms and values set by the American Marketing 
Association it is essential that we are reminded of the core values that govern marketing namely 
1	 Marketers should do no harm In that embodying high ethical standards and adhering to 
all laws and regulations in the decisions we make is fundamental to this practice 
2	 Trust should be fostered in the marketing system Avoid deception in product design pricing 
communication and delivery of distribution
3	 Hold on to ethical values Build relationships while also enhancing consumer trust in the 
integrity of marketing by acknowledging these core values honesty responsibility fairness 
respect transparency and citizenship AMA 2021
