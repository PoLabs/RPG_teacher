Conversion optimisation
2054 Problems in the conversion process
Funnel analysis is crucial to understanding where problems in a conversion process lie In 
this way it helps you to track whether your website or app is achieving its ultimate goal The 
process of achieving that goal can be broken down into several steps These are called events 
or microconversions Analysing each event is called a funnel analysis or path analysis 
For example on a hotel booking website the ultimate goal is that visitors to the site make a 
booking on the website with a credit card 
Each step in the process is an event that can be analysed as a conversion point
Event 1 Perform a search for available dates for hotels in the desired area
Event 2 Check prices and amenities for available hotels
Event 3 Select a hotel and go to checkout
Event 4 Enter personal and payment details and confirm booking conversion
One naturally expects fewer users at each step Increasing the number of visitors who progress 
from one step to the next will go a long way towards improving the overall conversion rate of 
the site
13 430 total visitors to the site
