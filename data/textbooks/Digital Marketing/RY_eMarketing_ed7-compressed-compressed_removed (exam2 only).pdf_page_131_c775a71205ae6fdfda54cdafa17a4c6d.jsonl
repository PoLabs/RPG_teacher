INTRODUCTION TO UNITING
This section is called Uniting because now you are bringing your brand and the customer 
together One of the worst mistakes a brand can make is  to deliver poor service no matter 
how polished your copy or how slick your videos If you have a terrible relationship with your 
online community they will go elsewhere Consider the Pareto principle 80 of profits are 
generated by 20 of customers while 20 of customers are responsible for 80 of the brands 
service problems
While most traditional marketing is one way from brand to consumer the internet offers 
exciting opportunities to engage meaningfully with your customers 
Chapter 14 Social media strategy focuses on how you can engage with your customers on 
a level and at a speed that is not possible through traditional marketing platforms You need 
to understand the landscape to implement and maintain your strategy
Once you have customer buyin the next step is to manage and maintain your brands rela
tionship with the customer
Chapter 15 Customer relationship management CRM is critical for any business It is 
especially important for a brand that has an online presence to understand the customers 
needs and foster longterm loyalty which in turn can lead to gaining online brand ambassadors 
Direct marketing is all about communication directly to the customer and this involves email 
and to some extent mobile channels 
Chapter 16 Direct marketing Email and mobile focuses on how to utilise these two channels 
Considering that 70 of the global population uses a mobile phone and that most emails 
are opened on mobile devices you cannot discount the power of these marketing strategies 
However you need to manage this relationship carefully users see mobile as their personal 
device and resent any intrusions on it
Social media is powerful and mistakes are amplified Remember that whoever has the social 
media network passwords represents your brand Direct marketing can result in the highest 
ROI but you need to be mindful of customer fatigue Creating quality content and messages 
that will be read requires focus dedication and above all ingenuity
