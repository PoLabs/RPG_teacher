Web development and design 
Step 4 Testing and launch 
Once you have planned an amazing site designed it beautifully built it skilfully and filled it 
with fantastic copy its time to test it and then take it live 
Testing is an important part of website development and design and it should take place 
throughout the process of planning designing and building leaving just final quality assurance 
QA testing before the site goes live Test subjects should be real potential users of the website 
not just members of the development team The site needs to be tested in all common browsers 
and devices to make sure that it looks and works as it should across all of them All links should 
be tested to make sure that they work correctly and its always a good idea to get a final check 
of all of the copy before it goes live 
Tools such as W3Cs HTML validator validatorw3org should be used to validate your HTML 
See more about testing in Section 77 Quality assurance
Make sure your web analytics tracking tags are 
in place after which it will be time to take your 
site live Now you need to move on to driving 
traffic to your newly launched site That is where 
all the Creating tactics in this textbook come in handy 
76 DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES 
There are different approaches to building a website The one described in this chapter Section 
75 The web development process is the waterfall process where one step follows the other 
This is in contrast with other methods such as the agile methodology which involves faster 
iteration and greater collaboration but doesnt afford clients as much control and upfront clarity 
on the deliverables and timelines
