Set a fixed width for your email by specifying 
the width and spacing of each cell rather 
than the entire table When these specifics 
are not declared email clients tend to 
render the email according to their own 
defaults and can break the design 
	
If you are using a block background colour be sure to include a 100width table to cover 
the entire email 
	
Keep fonts in your email design larger than 16px Anything below that becomes difficult 
to view in mobile Also bear in mind thatwhile coloured text or lightondark text may 
look visually impressiveit can be difficult to read an entire email like this and may strain 
your subscribers eyes Rather limit such visual tricks to smaller sections of your email or 
to emails that contain less written content 
	
Make use of inline CSS Some email clients strip the CSS from the head and body of the email 
	
Test your emails in a variety of email clients before you send
	
Use responsive design
Designing for the preview pane 
Many email users still use desktop clients to manage their email Given the number of emails 
users receive on a daily basis many still prefer to view emails in their preview panes rather 
than opening them This has added another challenge for designers who want to ensure that 
their emails display properly 
Images and layout should consider the preview pane and be tested for rendering Preview 
panes can be vertical or horizontal 
Tips for designing for the preview pane 
	
There is no set width Therefore testing is the way to go A width of 600px works best for 
preview pane display HubSpot 2016 
	
Ensure that plain emailfriendly fonts are used toward the top of your email in order to 
ensure that the first text encountered is properly displayed 
	
Consider carefully what images you display in the top section of your email and test displays 
accordingly 
	
Placing your logo prominently at the top left of your email can ensure optimal brand 
recognition and exposure 
	
Try to include your call to action in the area displayed in the preview pane That way even 
if subscribers choose not to read your emailtheyll still see your primary message 
	
Some successful email templates use the area likely to be seen in the preview pane to 
provide a table of contents for the email Users know what they can look forward to when 
opening the email
Naturally your email design should 
echo your overall corporate identity and 
personality
