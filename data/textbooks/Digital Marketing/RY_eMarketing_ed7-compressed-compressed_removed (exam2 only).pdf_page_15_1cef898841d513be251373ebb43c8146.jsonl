Adobe Flash in that the specification is the result of contributions from many organisations 
and can be implemented by anyone without having to pay for royalties or licensing fees You 
do however pay for the development tools provided by the companies

the size colour and spacing around the text as well as the placement of images and other 
designrelated items CSS preprocessors such as LESS SASS and Stylus are also available
