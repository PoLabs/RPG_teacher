177 MEASURING SUCCESS
Measuring the success of your social media advertising activities can be tricky As mentioned 
ROI can be difficult to establish but it can be done
Start by identifying your KPIs Note the 
difference between vanity metrics and those 
metrics that will actually be useful The 
number of fans on Facebook for example is 
a vanity metric It doesnt mean much on its 
own Instead you would want to look at the 
percentage increase in number of fans or the 
engagement rate of the fans that you have to 
see whether you are doing well
The KPIs you identify as important will depend on the goals of any campaign you run For 
example
	
If you want to drive revenue your important KPIs will be sales related such as product 
purchases signups for trials or traffic to your website which could then turn into a 
conversion 
	
If your goal is awareness your most important KPI might be reach 
	
If your goal is building customer relationships you would want to look at engagement 
numbers and sentiment
If you want to attach actual monetary value to your KPIs you need to decide what method 
you want to use Do you want to look at average sales the lifetime value of a customer or how 
much similar reach would cost you if you used different methods of advertising 
To measure your KPIs youll need to use the analytics tool of the platform youre advertising on 
see below You can use Google Analytics to see whether social drives traffic to your website 
to attribute revenue to specific posts to find out how visitors from social consume your content 
Not only is number of followers a vanity 
metric too many followers who are not 
quality followers can actually harm your 
brand Remember only a tiny percentage 
of your total audience will see your 
content organically so you want them to 
be engaged
NOTE
Remember that the majority of 
consumers read and care about online 
reviews The majority of consumers also 
pay attention to how businesses respond 
to online reviews You can read more
