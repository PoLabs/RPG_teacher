Figure 1 Differences between the metaverse and the multiverse 
Why the hype around the metaverse 
The metaverse presents massive opportunities for us to share value in a new way Web30 shares 
this code and serves as the foundation for the metaverse consisting of blockchainenabled 
applications that are decentralised aiming to support an economy of userowned assets and data 
As a result of the loss of trust in large organisations governments and big brands alike 
responsible contributors and creators are aiming to decentralise the economic benefit from 
these institutions and shift it back to the people who are creating the artefact or digital items 
to reward their effort At our very core humans want to be valued and recognised for who 
we are and what we do We want our time respected and we want to share our value with 
people who create that value The metaverse is enabling this by flipping the business model
