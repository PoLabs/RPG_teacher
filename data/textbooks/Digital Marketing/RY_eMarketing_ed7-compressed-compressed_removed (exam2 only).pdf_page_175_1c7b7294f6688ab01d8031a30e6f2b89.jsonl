Understanding customer lifetime value
CLV is the profitability of a customer over their entire relationship with the business 
Businesses need to look at longterm customer satisfaction and relationship management 
rather than shortterm campaigns and quick wins This approach leads to increased 
value over the entire lifetime of a customer and means that CLV is a metric central to 
any CRM initiative 
Its important to look at your customer base and segment them according to how often 
they purchase and how much they spend with your company Very often customers who 
spend more cost more to acquire but they might also stay with the company for longer 
Referrals made by a customer can also be included as part of the revenue generated by 
the customer

often they order are used to determine their CLV
The key is to understand these costs and then target your CRM strategies appropriately 
CLV lets you decide what a particular type of customer is really worth to your business 
as well as how much you are willing to spend to win or retain them 
For example a potential customer looking to purchase a digital camera is likely to search 
on Google for cameras As a company selling digital cameras your excellent search advert 
and compelling offer attract the potential customer who clicks through to your website 
Impressed with your product offering the user purchases a camera from you and signs 
up to your email newsletter as part of the payment process 
Analysing the amount spent on your search campaign against the sales attributed to 
the campaign will give the cost per acquisition of each sale In this case this is the cost 
of acquiring the new customer 
As the users are now signed up to your newsletter each month you send them compelling 
information about products they may be interested in These newsletters could focus on 
their obvious interest in photography and highlight additional products they can use with 
their new camera Think about the value exchange that is necessary for a customer to 
give you their attention Content marketing is a powerful tool here The costs associated 
with sending these emails are the costs of maintaining the relationship with the customer
