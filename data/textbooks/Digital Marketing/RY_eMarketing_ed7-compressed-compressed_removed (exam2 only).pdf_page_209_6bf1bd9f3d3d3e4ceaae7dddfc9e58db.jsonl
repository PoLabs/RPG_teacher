as cheaper smartphones are becoming available which increases their penetration into 
lowerincome areas
Text emails include small plain text only content If you use a Windows Operating System 
open Notepad and type there you will be creating a text file As these are text only the copy 
really counts here
HTML emails have more complex designs These emails can contain images different fonts 
and hyperlinks Theyre probably what youve had in mind throughout this chapter when we 
referred to email marketing 
Parts of an email 
Each part of an email serves a particular function
Sender information 
This includes the to from and reply to fields 
These are opportunities to build a relationship 
through creating a perception of familiarity 
In other words the reader needs to perceive 
that the newsletter is somewhat unique and 
sent personally by the publisher Using a personalised company email address eg trevor
companycom for the reply field creates familiarity and builds trust with the reader provided 
the name is recognisable Otherwise using the brand name is fine The from address should 
also include the organisations name A meaningless from address that the reader cannot 
identify serves only to confuse the origin of the newsletter 
Subject line 
The subject line may be the most important 
part of an email Subject lines help the reader 
to identify the email and entice them to open 
it The subject line is also scrutinised by spam 
filters so you should avoid using unusual 
characters for example 2 or  Emojis such as smiley faces or hearts can 
sometimes work but first test to see what works for you 
Consistent subject lines using the name of the company and the newsletter edition can build 
familiarity and help readers to sort their inbox Subject lines should also reflect the content of 
the email As with everything online testing different subject lines will lead marketers to the 
formula that works for them Some brands have found that using emojis can improve open 
rates while others have had no success with them 
Refer to the images of the full newsletter 
later in this chapter to see how these 
elements look in context
NOTE
You could also try personalising the 
subject line with the recipients name or 
location to make your email stand out
