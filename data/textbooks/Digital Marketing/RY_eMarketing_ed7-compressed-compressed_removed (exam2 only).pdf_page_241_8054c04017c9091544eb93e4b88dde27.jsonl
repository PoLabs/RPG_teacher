ADVERTISING
1743 Platforms
One of the core principles to keep in mind when choosing a social media platform on which 
to advertise is that you need to go where your audience is You will find different audiences 
and communities on different platforms Even if one person is on multiple social media platforms 
they perform vastly different activities on each of them Be sure to choose a platform that fits 
your needs as a business as well
Lets take a look at a few of the most popular 
platforms to see what they can offer and why 
you might want to focus your attention on 
them As you read keep in mind that for most 
networks the number of older users is increasing which can lead to changes in the behaviour 
of younger users on the platform or even drive them off entirely
Facebook
What they offer Facebook offers a wide array of targeting options and the biggest social 
media audience in the world with roughly 289 billion users as of the second quarter of 2021
