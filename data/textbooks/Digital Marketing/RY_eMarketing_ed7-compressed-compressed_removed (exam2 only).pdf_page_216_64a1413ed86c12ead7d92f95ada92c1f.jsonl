are blockedyour buttons will be blocked too 
Generally both text links and CTA buttons are effective for generating clickthroughs though

support your CTA eg make a booking check availability your email shouldnt be littered 
with them and hyperlinks should be used for additional links You should test them to see

1643 SMS best practice 
Structuring an SMS involves considerably fewer considerations than writing an email Keep 
in mind
	
The core concern for SMS writing is that they are limited to 160 characters which means 
the hardest part of writing one is finding a way to convey your core message with very 
limited space 
	
Part of your SMS needs to be dedicated to offering an optout option so that users feel in 
control of the communications
	
Because the mobile phone is so personal sending relevant targeted SMS messages is 
imperative Make sure that your mobile optin database is very carefully segmented 200 
subscribers who actually want to hear from you are far more valuable than 2000 who feel 
annoyed or harassed by your messages
	
Think about when you send your messages are they being sent at a time that is relevant 
to your customer If you are sending a sales promotion message are you sending it at 
6am in the middle of the month or at 10 am on a weekend after payday
	
Make sure that if your SMS includes a next step such as clicking through to a website the 
landing page is mobileoptimised
SMS is often best used for customer relationship management but you can also use it to send 
promotions targeted to a time of day when your customers are likely to be out shopping or 
aimed at specific demographics or geographic areas Just remember as with all direct marketing 
these messages need to be relevant and valuable to your customer
