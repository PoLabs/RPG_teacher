Data can give you these insights It can enable a company to create real value for the customer 
and thereby gain true loyalty There is little point in running a customer insights survey looking 
at the results and saying thats interestingwithout putting into action any changes suggested 
by the results Not auctioning noticeable changes also means customers are less likely to take 
part in surveys going forward and quite rightly so Whats in it for them Conversely if you do 
action changes customers will feel increased ownership in the brand and its offering 
The actual technology you use to gather and 
collate data is also crucial Remember that there 
are many facets to CRM and the quality and 
accessibility of the data will have a major 
impact on how well these processes run 
When deciding on which system to use it is 
important to note the key requirements of your 
specific brand as each tool or system has its 
own USPs and quirks
When looking at data it is essential to keep in mind the Pareto principle The Pareto principle 
or 8020 rule holds that in many situations approximately 80 of profits are delivered by 20 
of customers Also keep in mind the traditional view that 20 of customers are responsible for 
80 of problems related to service and supply Koch 2008 
Figure 155 The Pareto principle
This means designing solutions with efforts directed at the 20 of customers who generate 
the most profits To do this you should segment customers effectively Highvalue segments 
are unique to each business 
Youll also want to consider the exact data to collect While this will depend largely on your 
business objectives here are some considerations
Choosing a CRM system and 
operationalising it in your business 
is no small undertaking Cost can be 
dramatically impacted by how well 
this system can integrate with other 
processes and tools in your business
Make sure to do your homework before 
jumping in
