marketing emails in 2018 were considered spam by email providers This is out of a total of 
just over 281 million emails sent in that year 
By 2025 it is estimated that over 376 million emails will be sent in that year alone which is a 
growth of almost 100 million emails in less than ten years
Growing this database while keeping it targeted is a key factor in any direct marketing campaign 
The database needs only one entry the prospects email or phone number but the following 
should also be considered
	
Name surname and title
	
Date permission granted
	
Source of permission
	
Gender
	
Country
	
Date of birth
	
Phone number or email depending on which you already have
	
Frequency how often theyd like to hear from you 
Fields such as name surname and title should be separated in your database You should also 
gather date of birth as opposed to a prospects age as it ensures that your database can stay 
up to date
Dont be tempted to ask for more information 
than required The more information a marketer 
can gather the better they can customise 
marketing messages However the more infor
mation a prospect is required to give the less 
likely they are to sign up Further information 
can be requested over time 
There are many ways to attract prospects to opt into a database An email sign up form on a 
company website is vital Website visitors express an interest in a company by clickingthrough 
and this is an opportunity to develop that interest further Following the same principle any other 
properties where newsletter or SMS sign up can be promoted should be taken advantage of 
Consider having a signup form on your 
company blog email signatures Facebook 
page and mobi site or perhaps mention it 
during presentations you deliver And dont 
forget other offline marketing channels that 
youre already using such as flyers posters or 
instore displays Many brands use competitions to encourage optins as well Remember users 
are more likely to opt in with an email address than a mobile phone number on most channels
As always the best longterm strategy 
for growing your database is to create 
valuable shareable content that users 
want to read
