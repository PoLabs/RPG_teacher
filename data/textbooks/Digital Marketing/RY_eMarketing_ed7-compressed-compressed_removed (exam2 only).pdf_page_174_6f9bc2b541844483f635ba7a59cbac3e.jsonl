Customer relationship managementCRM
ROI stands for return on investment and its key to understanding whether marketing efforts 
have been successful Heres a simple example Company A sells accounting software and 
makes R10000 on each product it sells It sends an email to its customer base users who 
have bought a previous version of the software and might be interested in upgrading The 
campaign has an overall cost of R100000 Of the 5000 users who receive the email 10 
decide to buy That means it cost R200 to acquire each of the 500 customers The company 
has made R5million an ROI of 501 
Integration is the key to the effective use of technology in CRM Ensure that all channels can 
be tracked and that information is usable to all parties within an organisation Knowing where 
your customers come from but not what they purchase is pointless these two metrics need 
to be compared in order to produce actionable insights 
Analysing CRM data can aid marketing initiatives in a variety of ways for example
	
Campaign analysis Find out which 
marketing campaigns are leading to the 
best returns so you can refine them and 
increase ROI 
	
Personalisation Customise your commu
nications to each customer
	
Event monitoring Tie offline events like 
shows or sales to your online interactions and sales
	
Predictive modelling Predict a customers future behaviour and meet this need at the 
right time 
Analysing CRM data can aid in improved customer segmentation including 
	
Customer lifetime value CLV analysis Predicting each customers lifetime value and 
managing each segment appropriately eg offering special deals and discounts
	
Advanced customer profiles Identifying certain behaviours such as big spenders or those 
who look for bargains by attending sales This information can be used to tailor marketing 
communications accordingly
	
Customer prioritisation Targeting small groups of customers with customised products 
and service offerings that are aligned to meet customer needs rather than simply generic 
current offerings You should craft specialised retention strategies for customers with the 
highest CLV 
	
Identify brand influencers and advocates Consider the realm of social media where 
influencers are central to the spread of content Brands are increasingly prioritising relation
ship building with social media influencers to build brand advocates who will help market 
the business for them By identifying which customers are providing the most value and 
positively influencing others to become customers you can focus efforts towards them 
and increase their loyalty creating true brand advocates 
Mobile marketing can play a key role 
in offline events The mobile phone is 
portable and connected to the internet 
which means that users can engage a 
brand directly on location
