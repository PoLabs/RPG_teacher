Social media strategy
Social media is a great tool for monitoring what is being said about your brand and to spot 
a potential crisis long before it becomes one Such a heads up allows your brand to mediate 
the crisis by being proactive and preparing for the situation before it takes hold Being ready 
in any event is a great space for you to manage your communication because it enables you 
to get your side of the story out 
1435 Advertising and awareness
Where there is an audience there is advertising The more time users spend on social media 
the more brands want to advertise there Its not only the large numbers of active users or the 
time users spend social networks its the rich demographic and psychographic targeting 
opportunities that make them appealing to advertisers 
Adverts can be targeted based on the profile 
information that individuals provide either 
overtly or through their actions on the social 
network Most social networks offer a number 
of advertising options that are accessible to 
both small advertisers and big spenders Social advertising is dynamic with new advertising 
options released regularly To find the platform and ad type that works best for your audience 
you should experiment with the different formats and models offered 
1436 Sales and lead generation 
Adding a social layer to a commercial transaction can create a richer experience for online 
consumers These can be based overtly on social connections or on inferred connections 
based on behaviour 
Amazons collaborative filtering is an excellent example of the layer based on inferred connec
tions If youve browsed their website you will no doubt have seen product information such 
as Frequently bought together In real time based on consumer purchase behaviour Amazon 
presents products that you are likely to have an interest in based on users who browsed and 
purchased products that you like or have selected to buy 
You may not realise it but this is a social layer in the online shopping experience Users benefit 
because they are exposed to new items that they may not have thought about looking for 
making the shopping experience easier and tailored to their needs The brand benefits from 
the additional sale on items that the user may not have considered purchasing until they were 
shown the options 
Social communities can also be lead generation or sales generation assets You may find your 
friends tagging someone maybe even you to a post that they believe will be interesting or 
useful to them or you One way of managing your community to grow your audience base 
and improve targeting is knowing how to engage with these leads to get them to follow you
