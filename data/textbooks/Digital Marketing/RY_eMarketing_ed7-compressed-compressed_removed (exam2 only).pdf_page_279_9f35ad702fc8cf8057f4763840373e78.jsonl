ANALYSING
These combinations came from 35 touchpoints including the website campaigns and other 
marketing channels and 37 analytics points including auto buyers and smartphone users 
The brand was able to spot relevant patterns eg consumers who bought a certain brand 
of car were more likely to download brochures but not more likely to request test drives 
This allowed them to segment the consumers who bought cars into those who started 
the purchase process by downloading a brochure and those who started with a test drive
The first group was detailoriented so ads featuring specific models with links to the 
specifications page helped to drive conversions
The second group wanted to know how driving the car felt they were targeted with ads 
that appealed to their senses and included a call to action about scheduling a test drive 
This helped to drive media efficiency and campaign performance
204 TRACKING AND COLLECTING DATA
Data tracking is the process of selecting specific metrics and events to track then collecting 
organising and analysing the resulting data Once youve analysed the data you can apply 
your insights to improve business performance and customer experience Baker 2021
A key problem with tracking users on websites used to be that it was impossible to track 
individual users  only individual browsers or devices  since this was done through cookies 
If for example Levi visits the website from Chrome on his home computer and Safari on his 
work laptop the website will think hes two different users If Nosipho visits the site from the 
home computer also using Chromethe website will think shes the same user as Levi because 
the cookie set when Levi visited the site will still be there
Email opens arent tracked with cookies Instead when the images in the email load 
a tiny 11 pixel also loads and tracks open rate This means that if the user is blocking 
images their activity will not be tracked 
To track if those who did open your email then visited your page or eventually converted 
links within the email also include UTM tags UTM tags are codes in the URL that enable 
your analytics software to track where a user has come from
