They worked with an ESP to make sure their emails were certified and created an entirely 
optin email list Using tracking they identified a handful of domains and subsegments of 
donors that were reporting abnormally high spam rates which they decided was due to 
regional differences  their campaigns worked well in the United States but not in each of 
the 180 countries to which they were sending emails For example nonEnglishspeaking 
countries reported higher spam rates They suppressed these domains from their list and 
automatically unsubscribed anyone who reported an email as spam
Next they created a personalised recommendation email using a recommendation engine 
similar to Netflix Rather than looking at watching habits they looked at users past giving 
habits GlobalGiving used this information along with a matching offer and a timebound 
appeal for users to donate by a certain deadline
They followed this with constant AB split testing to ensure that their recommendation 
engine was working They also tested subject lines content appeals and more
The results 
The team saw a tenfold increase in engagement from email
	
Their recommendation emails dramatically outperformed the emails that sent random 
projects to donors
	
When factoring in the donors giving history using projects they had supported in the 
past they saw a 20 boost in engagement as well
They also created a carefully set up email program focused on improving the brands 
reputation in the long term
