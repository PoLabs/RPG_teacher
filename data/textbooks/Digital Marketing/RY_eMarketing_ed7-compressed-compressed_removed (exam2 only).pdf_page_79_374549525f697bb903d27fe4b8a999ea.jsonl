Recency How does this impact the algorithm andor user experience
Stories are ordered or shown according to the relevancy score that is calculated from the factors 
listed above Its based on what the algorithm believes is important and meaningful to the user
A user is more likely to interact with content that is displayed in their Feed so it is vital to 
ensure that your page content takes this algorithm into consideration Brands are spending 
on ad campaigns and promoting their posts to compete with the algorithm It is however 
recommended to work with it instead Learn about what your specific audience finds important 
and meaningful to create content that will resonate with them In turn you will send positive 
ranking signals to the algorithm
There are five things publishers can do to optimise their potential for appearing in user Feeds 
These are 
	
Use compelling headlines
	
Avoid being overly promotional
	
Try a range of media forms and monitor which is most appreciated by the audience 
	
Utilise publisher tools to provide Facebook with audience optimisation and audience 
restriction information 
	
Use boosted posts or paid ads to gain exposure 
Doing the opposite of the above can cause users to hide block or unsee content that you 
publish Remember to be sensitive and avoid overpromoting your brand
When users tag their friends or brand pages 
in their personal Facebook content the post 
will appear on their timeline and it will notify 
the friend and the brand page If it is a public 
post it could be shown to some of the brand 
pages fans This is also true for brands tagging 
other brands which is encouraged to increase 
exposure 
Facebook Live allows people public figures 
and brands to share live video with their followers and friends on Facebook It is available to 
anyone with a page or profile on Facebook Viewers can react and comment in real time on 
the video and brands can monitor how the broadcast is going Facebook Live records the 
videos as well which can then be viewed like any other Facebook video
