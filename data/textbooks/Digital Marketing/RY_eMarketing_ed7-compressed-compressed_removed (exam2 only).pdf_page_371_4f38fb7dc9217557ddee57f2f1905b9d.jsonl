brand and company will need a metaverse strategy and defined metaverse ethical policies to 
create experiences that transcend the world as we see it today 
Bias for instance is emerging in AI as a result of prejudice data being fed into AI systems 
bringing scientists to conclude that traditional algorithms were biased The ethical roadmap 
for the metaverse is still being carved out It will be interesting to see how moderation 
will be done on the metaverse what the avatars legal personality entails or if ownership 
of virtual property and assets can be used as collateral in the real world
Human interface 
The layer that deals with the human interface refers to the hardware or devices that will allow 
users to experience the full extent of the metaverse Over time technology has been drawing 
us closer to our devices which have been getting smaller smarter and portable Inventions 
like smart phones smart watches and smart glasses are enabling us to connect and engage 
a lot more quickly and seamlessly from any location in the world 
The fact that humans and machines are growing closer is necessary for an immersive lifelike 
experience of the metaverse With the advancement of spatial computing we will likely be 
able to experience the metaverse as we do the physical world soon
Infrastructure 
This layer is made up of the technological infrastructure that will be required to create a fully 
functional and interoperable metaverse According to Takyar nd LeewayHertz there are five 
groups of technology that drive the metaverse
	
Computing power and network that includes spatial positioning algorithms edge 
computing GPU servers realtime network transmission and virtual scene fitting
	
Artificial intelligence
	
Video gaming technologies that include 3D game engines to create the resources such 
as animations sounds and images
	
Display technologies that include AR VR and MR that are not only purposed for an 
immersive audiovisual experience but also for the experience of users evolving tastes 
and preferences over time
	
Blockchain technology that is supported by the decentralised value transfer mechanisms 
settlement platforms and smart contracts to assure value ownership and circulation 
Through decentralisation an economic system that features transparency efficiency and 
stability will be realised
