Conversion optimisation
AB tests 
An AB test is one in which each version being tested is different from all the others AB 
tests always involve just two versions of what is being tested the original and an alternative
Figure 214 AB testing explained visually 
AB tests are ideal for an initial foray into conversion optimisation as they can be easy to set 
up If you are running just one alternate and the original it can also mean that you get a quicker 
result When conducting AB testing you should only change one element at a time so that 
you can easily isolate what impact each factor has on your conversion rate
We can also run multivariate tests sometimes referred to as MVTs Here a number of elements 
on a page are tested to determine which combination gives the best results For example we may 
test alternative headlines alternative copyand alternative call to action buttons Two versions 
of three elements mean that we are testing eight combinations Here is a simple formula to 
calculate the total number of versions in a multivariate test No of variations of element A  
No of variations of element B  No of variations of element C   Total no of variations
Multivariate testing helps avoid the need to conduct several sequential AB tests and easily 
determines the contribution of each page element to the measured gains
