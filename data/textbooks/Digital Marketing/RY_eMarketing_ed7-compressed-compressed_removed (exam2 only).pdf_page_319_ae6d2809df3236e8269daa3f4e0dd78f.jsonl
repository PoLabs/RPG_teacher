ANALYSING
Wishpond 2016 provides a threestep formula for creating an AB Testing Hypothesis 
Step 1
Conversion problem
Why arent the people converting
Step 2
Proposed solution
What tests can be run to fix the conversion problem
Step 3
Impact statement
How do you anticipate your proposed solution will affect the conversion problem
Figure 2110 Threestep formula for creating an AB testing hypothesis
You now have a sound AB testing hypothesis 
2155 Run tests 
Implement the tracking code needed to run your tests Most testing software uses cookies to 
ensure that return visitors see the same version of the test they saw initially You will also need 
to put tracking code on your conversion page Before taking your test live make sure that the 
tracking code does not conflict with any other code on your website 
If everything checks out take your test live and wait for the data to be collected Check in 
regularly to see how the test is proceeding and wait for a statistically significant outcome 
2156 Report and repeat 
When you have a result its time to report on it Refer back to your null hypothesis to determine 
if the outcome was as expected and if it was statistically significant In your report you should 
include why things went as expected or why not 
Implement the betterperforming solution and plan your next test There is always something 
you can improve 
216 TOOLS OF THE TRADE 
Online conversion optimisation relies on being able to record which version of a test a web 
visitor sees and whether or not that visitor converted To avoid confusion a returning visitor 
should also see the same version they saw the first time to avoid confusion There are many 
software solutions that can help you
