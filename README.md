## Installation Instructions

To set up the app, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download and Unpack
1. Download the zip file from the Google Drive link provided.
2. Unpack the zip file:
```bash
unzip RPG_Teacher.zip -d RPG_Teacher
```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd RPG_Teacher
```
### Step 2:  Set Up a Virtual Environment
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv_app
source venv_app/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv_app\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 3: Configure API Keys
1. Edit the API keys in .streamlit/secrets.toml if needed:
```bash
nano .streamlit/secrets.toml
```
### Step 4: Run the App
1. Start the app using Streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run rpg_streamlit.py
```



## Adding New Documents

To add a new textbook or novel, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Curator Environment
Create and activate a new virtual environment for the curator:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv_curator
source venv_curator/bin/activate
```
Install the dependencies from requirements_curator.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_curator.txt
```
### Step 2: Convert Raw PDF Document
Place your raw PDF document in data/raw.
Run the conversion script:
```bash
python nemo_curator_tutorial.py --input-data-dir /data/raw --output-clean-dir /data/out --input-file-type pdf --output-file-type jsonl --batch-size 64
```
### Step 3: Organize Processed Files
Create new folders in data/novels or data/textbooks for each new document.
Manually copy the JSONL files from data/out into the newly created folder. Note that data/out will contain JSONL files from all processed documents.
### Step 4: Upload Data to Pinecone
Open and run the Jupyter notebook load_pinecone.ipynb.
Modify lines 14-15 and lines 70/72 to specify the names of your new document indexes.
If youâ€™re only uploading either a textbook or a novel, comment out the relevant lines (70 or 72) in the notebook.
Note: For large documents, this upload process may take 15-20 minutes.

### Step 5: Update the Application Code
Open rpg_streamlit.py.
Update the index_name_mappings dictionary (line 42) with the new document index names.
Add the new documents to the Streamlit UI section (lines 1093-1117).

### Step 6: Switch back to venv_app and run
```bash
source venv_curator/bin/activate
streamlit run rpg_streamlit.py
```
